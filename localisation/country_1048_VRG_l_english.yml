  ###Leader Descriptions###
  POLITICS_VIRGIL_1048_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 996 ALB\n\nAs a young chick, Virgil always looked up to his father, Virgil Sr., as a griffon of action and strength. In his heart of hearts, he always vowed to be like his father: not taking affront from anycreature, living his own life, and ensuring that he always remained a free and wandering spirit of adventure. For the first few years of his life, he lived that dream, watching as Virgil's Raiders plundered the countryside of the Griffonian Frontier and live a comfortable, if simple life in the mountains.\n\nThat all changed, however, when Virgil managed to wrestle control of the Frontier from Governor Muck. For a few short months, both Virgils lived in comparative luxury in the governor's residence. The raiders continue to extract money from the citizens, what little there was, and life was enjoyable. Then Teafeather retaliated and Virgil Sr.'s group of bandits were quickly and effortlessly eliminated, only a few veterans managing to escape into the mountains.\n\nBefore Virgil Sr. was captured and executed, he left his son in the care of one of his captains, and soon Virgil Jr. was spirited away into hiding. In a few short years afterward, he was old enough to join high marshal-turned-emperor Erwin Highhill's army, which he did in a heartbeat. To him, the only surety in life was strength, and Highhill was the way to show his.\n\nWhen Highhill died in battle against the changelings in 1022, he moved back to the old Griffon Frontier and set about forming a new, stronger marauding force of bandits to put his father to shame. Not even a week after the new emperor was crowned in Weterheim, Virgil seceded and carved out his own petty fiefdom in central portion of the Empire.\n\nVindictive and conniving, Virgil has grown to despise his father's legacy, citing him as a weak and cowardly griffon who never had the spine to fight against authority. Any mention of his heritage usually leaves the speaker dead or maimed, a policy which has extended into his rule. Oppression is the modus operandi under Virgil's Marauders, and there is little sign that he will change his ways in the future."
  DEFINITELY_NOT_VIRGIL_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: ???\n\nNogriff knows exactly who the mysterious Ligriv is or where he came from. All griffs do know is that he looks suspciciously like Virgil, and he leads with him a collection of goons and thugs who appear to be like some of his inner circle of gang members who 'convince' workers that they deserve more freedom. Such freedom tends to be of the indentured servitude to Ligriv.\n\nOut of the last fifteen riots started by communists in the city of New Virgillia, Ligriv has been at all but two, and the two of which he had been absent, Virgil had been present to put the revolts down rapidly. In fact, Virgil and Ligriv are never in the same place at the same time, and both have expressed a strong desire to meet the other. However, whenever questioned on when they'd meet, if they knew each other at one time, or if they were estranged brothers at birth, the questioner confusingly vanishes. Sometimes violently.\n\nWhatever the case, Ligriv is bent on his own form of communism, one where he retains control as much as possible. Some whisper that he's nothing more than Virgil with a false mustache and glasses, but most are wiser than to suggest that publicly. With each successful protest, Ligriv claims victory for the workers, even if they appear to be worse off than before. Surely it's just a small step in the road to utopia? There would be no reason for Ligriv to lie to his fellow comrades, would there?"
