POLITICS_DAYBREAKER_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: At least 2000 BLB\n\n§YBiography§!: For eons, the land of Equestria was protected by two sister alicorns to rule over the day and night. Their serene guidance helped establish strong ties between ponies, forming harmony that lasted for generations to come. Little is known where the sisters, Celestia and Luna, originated from. In their early rule, many venerated them as gods before they were kindly corrected.\n\nThe harmony of Equestria would not last, however, as the Great War of 1011 would shatter the idyllic outlook of her ponies. Out of this chaos, Daybreaker would emerge. She answered the call, overpowering what sanity Celestia had left to provide the final solution to her problems: unending, overwhelming firepower.\n\nDaybreaker is everything Celestia was not: pompous, arrogant, self-centered, aggressive. Her ponies are merely tools to her, the Solaris Adoratio (Solar Cult), the outlet to keep their fears at bay. Despite the decades since the collapse of the great Solar Empire, many still worship at her hooves, and Imperial society is one of endless adoration and sacrifice. Daybreaker cares little beyond one day reclaiming her rightful place as ruler, not just of the lands of Equestria, but one day the world. All will worship the sun, and Daybreaker will be the herald of their salvation.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Twotail"
POLITICS_AURORA_SHINESPARK_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 1021 ALB\n\n§YBiography§!: One of the youngest ponies to achieve the rank of Archmage in the Solaris Inquisitionis, Aurora Shinespark grew up staunchly in the hardest portions of the Solar Empire. Raised in Manehattan, she experienced the first union riot of 1032, where she earned her cutie mark in infernal magic defending a pair of citizens from rogue workers.\n\nWhen she reached the appropriate age, she attended former Princess Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns, now Daybreaker's College for Talented Mages. Successfully reaching the rank of Mage, she was given a position as lieutenant of the former Archmage of her home city, Nebula Flare. However, Nebula Flare was declared a heretic, and fled the country, placing the fairly green Aurora in charge of the chapter.\n\nUnder her leadership, she held the peace in Manehattan, although little was done to resolve the unrest. While she can have a hoofs-off methodology, when pushed she will retaliate with appropriate force. As a loyal inquisitor, she ensures that ponies are kept in line.\n\nNow the Princess Regent, Aurora leads the nation with stern justice. Little of the entrenchment of the Adoratio and Inquisitionis in government has been addressed. Primarily, her goals are reconquest of the nation, ensuring that the position she was entrusted in follows Daybreaker's vision. The Empress' memory will be honored, and she will be venerated as the immortal, unstoppable being she is.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
POLITICS_SUNSET_SHIMMER_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 980 ALB\n\n§YBiography§!: Once the friendship student of Celestia, Sunset Shimmer grew jealous of other ponies and their rapid advancement through Celestia's school. She was not a stupid student, in fact she was a genius, but she considered friends and spending time with them beneath her. In 999 ALB, she broke into the forbidden library of the Canterlot Palace and found her escape. She would run to another world, return with its inhabitants, and conquer Equestria, setting herself up as its new ruler.\n\nThat did not go according to plan, and she was stopped by Celestia's following student, Twilight Sparkle. Although offered a place to return to, she insisted on residing with her new friends in this new world. The honeymoon period was short, and soon Sunset began to grow irritated with many of her friends' quirks.\n\nAlthough she remained connected with them, she let them drift apart, and when Daybreaker summoned her, she answered the call. Daybreaker trained her, forging her into the first leader of the revitalized Solaris Adoratio. Replacing Padlock Key, Sunset rebuilt the order from the ground up, making it the paramilitary arm of Daybreaker's control. All aspects of public life were dictated by the priestesses and battlemages of the order.\n\nBut, she was not satisfied. The Adoratio proclaimed to be family yet did not act like it. Change was still needed, and with Daybreaker's incapacitation, she has that chance. Solar society is still strict, but it is fair. Ponies have the freedom to worship Daybreaker as they wish, and already the spark of unity in the nation is resurging. For however long she lives, Sunset will ensure the memory of both her mentors lives on, forever engrained in the culture.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

POLITICS_SOLAR_FLARE_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: At least 5000 BLB\n\n§YBiography§!: Once, eons ago, the continent of Equus was a far different land. Pony settlements were few and scattered, and they kept their relevant cliques. Great pegasus enclaves floated in the sky, rarely trading with their neighbors above or on the ground. Earth ponies tilled the dirt, hoarding most of their crop for themselves, and barely providing for everypony else. Unicorns, the most powerful of the three, neither toiled for their food nor aided in weather. For the price of protection from harm, they were given what was left of the goods from the earth pony tribes. Frequently they would take more, leading to increased strife in all aspects.\n\nAll of this was not what they believed the great Faust, creator of the world and universe, had intended. She believed that her ponies would live in harmony, utilizing their innate talents to complement and support each other. Ponies had sinned, and they needed salvation.\n\nFrom this, two new ponies arrived one day in the heart of the early Equish Empire. They were an odd combination: They had the strength of earth ponies, the flight of pegasi, and the magic of unicorns. Both claimed to be descended from the great Faust. The elder sister, Elysia, was forged from a piece of the sun; the younger, Selena, was crafted out of the face of the moon. Together, they healed the divide between the three tribes, and for centuries, their rule created harmony in the land.\n\nIt would not last, as the three tribes began their squabbles. A chasm opened, ripping apart those who were loyal to the diarchs, and those who believed their individuality was more important. In the culmination of the combatting, Selena was captured, and subsequently killed. It was in that moment, Elysia realized her mother's mistake: Ponies could not be controlled. They would have to be punished instead. The world was corrupt, and she would bring its destruction.\n\nSolar Flare is the epitome of power: her veins pulse with the plasma that fuels the sun itself. Bloodthirsty, haughty, unyielding, Solar Flare has one overarching goal: the punishment of ponykind for its rejection she and her sister. For she is death incarnate, and Equus' debt is finally to be collected.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: cameil"
