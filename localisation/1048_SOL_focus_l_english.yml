  ###Descriptions###
  purging_the_remnant_desc:0 "Although the Empress has ruled for almost forty years, there are still heretics that defy her deity. Starlight Glimmer and Trixie Lulamoon are chiefest among them, and have organized resistance cells for decades. The Empress has tolerated them long enough! The Inquisitionis will scour the Empire in search of their location, beginning with weaklings in the Solaris Militarium."
  burning_the_countryside_desc:0 "It would be impossible for Starlight and Trixie to remain undetected in urban centers, for the Empress's presence is all ecompassing there. There are indications they've organized in the sympathetic towns and villages, and that is where the Inquisitionis will search."
  incinerating_the_chaff_desc:0 "Once the site of a great battle between the Solaris Adoratio and the heretical harmonists, Ponyville has been a hotbed of heretics since its capture, and the local chapter there has been largely ineffective. The cancer shall be rooted out, and the heretics will be interrogated."
  dead_shall_find_solace_desc:0 "A heretic in Ponyville indicated that there were some cells that festered in the heartland of the Empire. Starting with the farmers, the Inquisitionis will storm through and purify the land, investigating any clues to the location of Starlight and Trixie."
  shatter_and_uproot_desc:0 "Little progress has been made! Rumors are abounding that Starlight and Trixie are stirring up a large rebellion, and time is of the essence. The simpletons in the mines and forestries will tell all, as they have probably been turned for years."
  truth_in_flame_desc:0 "At last, we have found a pony who knows something. A mine forestallion attempted to flee as the Inquisitionis worked through his station. There is already more than enough evidence to convict him of heresy, it is only a matter of how much he will tell."
  scouring_the_cities_desc:0 "While the Empress may be all-seeing, she still can not notice every little detail at once. It may be counterintuitive, but it is likely that Starlight and Trixie have based themselves out of one of the hive cities of Fillydelphia or Manehattan. Focus shall be leveled there."
  clearing_the_filth_desc:0 "Fillydelphia has a large population of disenfranchised and homeless ponies. What better breeding ground for heretical teachings and disloyalty? It will only be a small fire that cleanses them, and they are of little other value. Perhaps there will be clues in the ashes."
  a_clue_in_the_darkness_desc:0 "Unsurprisingly, there was little to be gleaned from the fringes of society. However, the pipes of Fillydelphia would provide ample space for operating unseen..."
  inquisitionis_in_the_sewers_desc:0 "After far too long, the Inquisitionis has captured a worker with knowledge of the harmonic resistance. He was protected by a pair of unicorns who opened fire on the inspecting mages, and was subsequently captured. He shall be most helpful."
  empress_give_wisdom_desc:0 "Pointed by the last heretic, we've raided a house outside of Fillydelphia and returned with a new heretic. This Slick Deal has already blubbered ad nauseum his innocence, and should be easily broken to speak the truth."
  demolishing_the_dredges_desc:0 "Manehattan, while well off, still suffers from bouts of heresy and communism. At the moment, a large protest is underway, and it provides ample opportunity to arrest "aggressive" members."
  scorched_salvation_desc:0 "From the union members, we have determined that some of the mill workers have funneled supplies to certain dead drop locations throughout the seaboard. Nothing is concrete, but it isn't a problem that can't be solved by a little heat."
  chat_with_mayor_desc:0 "Manehattan is growing more rotten by the day, and it is only possible because of Mayor Goldmane's incompetence, or willing cooperation. Whichever it is, he will not have to worry about the state of his city for long."
  purification_through_fire_desc:0 "Although he didn't know anything, Goldmane's office has been funneling bits into dummy accounts. These accounts have either been drained into others, or closed. However, one was tied to his assistant. They shall be most informative."
  knowledge_is_power_desc:0 "We now know that Starlight and Trixie will be attempting an insurrection in Manehattan. Although it is unknown why they are planning a bold move such as this, it requires utmost attention. Speculatores shall be dispatched to infiltrate lower levels of society, and hopefully, find out when this will occur."
  heresy_knows_no_bounds_desc:0 "It is only a matter of time until they show themselves. When they do, we shall be ready, and our flames shall purify them of their corruption."
