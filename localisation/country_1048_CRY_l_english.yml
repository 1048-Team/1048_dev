  ###Leader Descriptions###
  POLITICS_CADENZA_1048_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! 972 ALB\n\nOnce a pegasus from Vanhoover, Princess Mi Amore Cadenza ascended to the throne of the Crystal Empire in a wave of turmoil. Shortly after her wedding with Twilight Sparkle's brother, Shining Armor, in 1002, the Crystal Empire returned, plagued by its former ruler King Sombra's magic. It was left a floundering nation, without purpose or guidance while the Crystal Heart remained elusive. After finding it through various traps and magical hexes placed by Sombra, bringing the Crystal Empire back to its former glory.\n\nIn the aftermath, Cadance and her husband were acknowledged as the nation's rightful rulers, especially after Cadance's bloodline was traced back to the ancient Princess Amore. However, Cadance's victory over their former dictator was one of her only successes. The Empire was woefully behind other modern nations, and Equestria offered guidance in return for maintaining a strong presence in the Empire. While this was seen as acceptable, there was always a sliver of resentment in the populace.\n\nStaying out of the war with the changelings, Cadance hoped that she would have more time to build her forces, her economy, and assist Celestia. Instead, she found the Empire a refuge for ponies fleeing the shattered remains of her home country, desperate to avoid persecution under Daybreaker. Her princess peers soon formed a council with her, to guide the Empire together, even if she remained de facto leader.\n\nShortly after Equestria's truce, Chrysalis forced the Crystal Empire to sign a reparations treaty to pay economic damages wrought by the 1002 Canterlot War. Since then, the economy has been teetering and unrest has been slowly building between citizens and refugees. Disastrous military campaigns against the fledgling Solar Empire left the coffers depleted and the army in disarray.\n\nThe years have not been kind to Cadance. While immortal like the other alicorns, the many hours of stress have taken a toll on her appearance, and her rule has been nothing but a string of failures. But as the last bastion of Harmony on Equus, she continues to keep hope alive for ponykind. Will her light shine for all, or will it be consumed by the darkness and be forever snuffed out?\n\n §YPortrait By:§! Scroup"

  dying_heart:0 "Dying Heart"
  dying_heart_desc:0 "As a representation of the very health of the nation, the Crystal Heart has been slowly atrophying as the Crystal Empire has grown more distant and hostile. With the rising tensions between the refugees and the average worker, the Heart has become brittle and cracked. Already snow has snuck into the Crystal City itself, and the atmosphere is as frigid as the love that ponies hold for each other in their hearts."
