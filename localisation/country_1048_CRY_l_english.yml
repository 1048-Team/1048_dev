  ###Leader Descriptions###
  POLITICS_CADENZA_1048_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! 972 ALB\n\nOnce a pegasus from Vanhoover, Princess Mi Amore Cadenza ascended to the throne of the Crystal Empire in a wave of turmoil. Shortly after her wedding with Twilight Sparkle's brother, Shining Armor, in 1002, the Crystal Empire returned, plagued by its former ruler King Sombra's magic. It was left a floundering nation, without purpose or guidance while the Crystal Heart remained elusive. After finding it through various traps and magical hexes placed by Sombra, bringing the Crystal Empire back to its former glory.\n\nIn the aftermath, Cadance and her husband were acknowledged as the nation's rightful rulers, especially after Cadance's bloodline was traced back to the ancient Princess Amore. However, Cadance's victory over their former dictator was one of her only successes. The Empire was woefully behind other modern nations, and Equestria offered guidance in return for maintaining a strong presence in the Empire. While this was seen as acceptable, there was always a sliver of resentment in the populace.\n\nStaying out of the war with the changelings, Cadance hoped that she would have more time to build her forces, her economy, and assist Celestia. Instead, she found the Empire a refuge for ponies fleeing the shattered remains of her home country, desperate to avoid persecution under Daybreaker. Her princess peers soon formed a council with her, to guide the Empire together, even if she remained de facto leader.\n\nShortly after Equestria's truce, Chrysalis forced the Crystal Empire to sign a reparations treaty to pay economic damages wrought by the 1002 Canterlot War. Since then, the economy has been teetering and unrest has been slowly building between citizens and refugees. Disastrous military campaigns against the fledgling Solar Empire left the coffers depleted and the army in disarray.\n\nThe years have not been kind to Cadance. While immortal like the other alicorns, the many hours of stress have taken a toll on her appearance, and her rule has been nothing but a string of failures. But as the last bastion of Harmony on Equus, she continues to keep hope alive for ponykind. Will her light shine for all, or will it be consumed by the darkness and be forever snuffed out?\n\n§YPortrait By:§! Scroup"
  POLITICS_LUNA_1048_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! At least 1500 BLB\n\nThe younger of the two original alicorn sisters, Princess Luna's past is still partly shrouded in mystery. For over a thousand years, she was trapped in the moon as punishment for her attempted coup against Celestia when she let her alter-ego, Nightmare Moon, corrupt her thoughts and twist them against her sister. When she returned, she brought eternal darkness for a few days before being restored by Twilight Sparkle and her friends.\n\nWhile for the first couple of years after her return, Luna found it difficult to accept herself, she eventually saw reason and moved past the worst of her mistakes. However, integrating into modern society was still a challenge for her, as she still had fresh memories of olden times of candlelight, back-breaking manual labor, and early bedtimes.\n\nHowever, by the start of the Great War in 1011, Luna had adapted well enough and, always having a taste for war compared to Celestia, led successful campaigns against the changeling forces. Despite that, Equestrian forces were still outnumbered and outgunned, and Celestia recalled her to help coordinate defensive lines across the remainder of the battle.\n\nCelestia was cold to her, and Luna could sense something moving inside her. Although she tried, she was unable to prevent Daybreaker from taking control of Celestia, and Luna organized a full retreat of loyalist forces to Ponyville, where she and Twilight held out until they could evacuate as many harmonists as possible.\n\nNow in refuge in the Crystal Empire, Luna's already serious and cool demeanor has grown impatient and confrontational. For over thirty years, she has seen refugees from her former kingdom flood into the Empire, and nothing has been done to adequately resolve the issue at its source: Daybreaker herself. While she held at one point a sliver of hope to Celestia's restoration, she knows it is useless. There is only one way to truly cure a monster: death.\n\n§YPortrait By:§! Scroup"
  POLITICS_TWIGGLES_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! 984 ALB\n\nTwilight Sparkle has led an interesting life. From a young age, she was the protegee of Princess Celestia during the final years of Equestria's life. In her early years, she studied as much as she wanted, enjoying the benefit of being the brightest and most privileged of all Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorn's students. However, the greatest lesson that Celestia wanted to instill was a difficult one. Reclusive and introverted, Twilight preferred spending time alone than wasting it with friends.\n\nIn 1000 ALB, her studies led her to believe that Nightmare Moon would soon be returning to exact vengeance. Her warnings were apparently ignored by Celestia, who instructed her instead to head to Ponyville to prepare for the summer solstice. Without Twilight's knowledge, this was Celestia's final attempt to teach her friendship. Celestia's gambit paid off, and Twilight and a group of ponies utilized the long-lost Elements of Harmony to rid Princess Luna of Nightmare Moon's influences.\n\nAfter Luna's purification, Twilight remained in Ponyville, learning more about friendship and forming deeper relationships with her new comrades. In 1003, she perfected an ancient spell by Star Swirl the Bearded, earning her the title of Princess of Friendship. Over the following years, Twilight converted many villainous creatures to the side of Harmony, earning her friends among the ranks of Starlight Glimmer, Sunset Shimmer, Discord, and others. In 1008 ALB she formed a new school dedicated to Friendship, which quickly flourished in the pre-Great War world.\n\nHowever, her idyllic view would be challenged by the Great War. Friendship dissolved, Harmony shattered. As a princess of Equestria, she was recalled to Canterlot to help guide the war effort, aiding scientific research in many areas. When Daybreaker came to power, her worldview was decimated. Her great teacher fell to evil, to corruption, and she could do nothing to stop it.\n\nWhile she and Luna attempted to keep Equestria alive, they eventually had to flee to refuge to the Crystal Empire along with the Elements of Harmony. As the decades went on, Twilight tried numerous times to determine what went wrong with Celestia, to no avail.\n\nOnly confusion rests in Twilight's mind now, leaving her restless and paranoid about the future. If Celestia could fall to evil, anypony could, and friendship could be destroyed forever. While she is still stable for now, the Sparkle family's neuroticism has been accentuated by her brother Shining's ill-health, and there is little to indicate if she could stay together if pressed. To her, the magic of friendship is always a hair's breadth away from breaking for good, and she is the only way to keep the world from falling to darkness.\n\n§YPortrait By:§! Scroup"

  CRY_1048_SHINING_ARMOR_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! 970 ALB\n\nAs another member of the Sparkle family, Shining Armor was blessed with an interesting life. In 1002 ALB, he was almost sucked dry of his love and life by Chrysalis, only being rescued at the last moment by his fiancée Cadance. Afterwards, he became the prince consort and commander of the Crystal Empire's forces once it returned from its thousand-year exile.\n\nWhen war broke out with the changelings and Equestria, he advised Cadance to stay out. The Crystal Empire was not yet ready, but if Equestria could hold for a while, they would be prepared to strike. He never received his chance, as Equestria sued for peace in 1014.\n\nIn the following years, he tried twice to liberate the shattered remains of Equestria from Daybreaker, both times failing miserably leading to considerable damage to the Crystal Empire's armies. In 1029, an uprising of communists received support from Stalliongrad, leading to a short war with the neighboring country. In the battles, he was wounded in the chest, forcing him from the front lines of battle.\n\nBy 1040, his health began to decline, with little sign for what the underlying cause was. Sometimes bedridden for days or weeks at a time, the once lively Shining Armor is a shell of his former self. One can only speculate how his eventual death will affect the Crystal Empire, or his family.\n\n§YPortrait By:§! ruhje"
