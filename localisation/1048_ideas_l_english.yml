 solar_cult:0 "Solar Cult"
 solar_cult_desc:0 "The Solaris Adoratio is the ancient cult of worship dedicated to Daybreaker. They handle all aspects of faith and veneration toward the God-Empress. Many priestesses and mages of the order have been placed in offices of power, mucking the bureaucratic process with endless red tape."
 solar_inquisition:0 "Solar Inquisition"
 solar_inquisition_desc:0 "The Solaris Inquisitionis is the militant arm of the Solaris Adoratio, investigating all reported instances of heresy against the Sun Goddess. They are entrenched in all aspects of the Solar Empire. This is great for stability and fervor in the Empire, but it makes it difficult for new technology to be accepted and culled heretics aren't soldiers fighting for Harmony's survival."
 great_war_aftermath:0 "Aftermath of the Great War"
 great_war_aftermath_desc:0 "Even after thirty years since the Treaty of Baltimare, the effect of constant wars of attrition has taken a toll on Imperial society and its economy. Significant reconstruction efforts are still underway, which is hindered by constant shifting of funds to Sanctum Solar for extravagant architectural projects."
 soldiers_of_the_sun:0 "Soldiers of the Sun"
 soldiers_of_the_sun_desc:0 "The Imperial army is fanatically loyal to Daybreaker and her regime. Day in and out they train to fight any threats to Harmony and Order. To die on the battlefield for the Empress is not just their duty but an honor and wounded soldiers are expected to fight to their last breath."
 heretical_commanders:0 "Heretics in High Command"
 heretical_commanders_desc:0 "Despite years of service, there are some generals that whisper behind closed doors. Daybreaker has issued orders to the Inquisitionis time and again to root out the heresy in her army yet they have only returned empty-hooved. The rot of Equestria still runs deep in the Solar Empire's forces, and will be difficult to root out."
