 mareland_socialism_desc:0 "MARESOC, or Equish Newspeak for Marelander Socialism, is a form of Markism defined by an oligarchic power structure, creating a strict social caste system. In MARESOC, there are always three distinct classes: the Proles, the Outer Party, and the Inner Party. The Inner Party is given luxuries and freedoms never seen by the overworked Outer Party, and the Proles are ignored, given debaucherous and mindless entertainment to keep them pacified. Any Party members who do not adhere to Big Sister's word are branded criminals who are rehabilitated in the mysterious halls of the Ministry of Love."

 solarism_desc:0 "Solarism is the religion of the ancient Solaris Adoratio, dedicated to the veneration, worship, and deification of Princess Celestia. Maligned during Celestia's millennia-long rule, after her corruption and ascension as Daybreaker Sun, the Solaris Adoratio was instated as the official religion and ideology of the Solar Empire. Any thought that does not agree with Daybreaker's is heresy. Heresy is punishable by death. Death by Holy Flame."
 
 changeling_ideology_desc:0 "Changeling Hegemonism, or Changelingsim, is the ideology that won the Great War, or so the books tell. The Changeling Lands are a disparate and diverse nation, filled with semi-autonomous hives that, when they aren't fighting amongst themselves, work toward a common goal. Changelingism looks to a strong, centralized leader to lead their armies to supremacy. Any queen from a hive can challenge the current supreme queen, leading to a cutthroat, aggressive, and expansionist ideology."
 harmonic_monarchy_desc:0 "Harmonic monarchies are one of the ancient forms of government from the before times. Monarchies are led by a benevolent, immortal alicorn Princess, who guide the nations through peaceful and troubled times alike. They are frequently stable, and their citizens enjoy many freedoms and luxuries. With the rise of radical ideologies such as Solarism or MARESOC, Harmonic Monarchism remains a fading beacon of liberty and love in a world marred by fear, control, and hatred."
 dictator_desc:0 "Wingbardian Fascism, or simply Fascism, is an ultranationalist ideology created by Giulio Beakolini. Under Fascism, the supreme dictator of the country leads all aspects of life, creating strict segmentation of the economy and of social order. Unity of spirit and belief is promoted above all else: the fatherland is superior to all other nations. Compared to other totalitarian ideologies, Fascism still provides minor freedoms to its citizens, as they are otherwise free to keep their thoughts to themselves—a luxury not afforded to those of the rising superpowers."
