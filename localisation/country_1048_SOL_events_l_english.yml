###Opening events to get Aurora to be a general###
  solar.1.t:0 "Thy Will be Done"
  solar.1.d:0 "Light poured through the simple windows of the room. It was small, square, and sparsely decorated. A basic cot was on one corner, and a small wardrobe filled with cloaks and robes was open. In the center of the room, facing into the sunlight and muttering under her breath, a small white unicorn basked in the warmth of Daybreaker's sun.\n\n"Oh Goddess, hallowed be thy Sun," she began praying aloud. To her, the sunshine coming in the from window wasn't just signifying a new day: it was Harmony and Order itself, cleansing her mind of any impure thoughts and healing her body of any harm caused by the darkness of Night.\n\nShe spread herself out on the floor, prostrate toward the window. "As your Sun purifies the world with its light, so too, let it purify our actions. Forgive us our daily sins and lead us not into heresy. Protect us from the forces of Chaos and Disorder, and strengthen our resolve against the heretic. May the fires of your wrath bring swift destruction to your foes. Give us this day the victory against the enemy!"\n\nSlowly, the unicorn got to her hooves, muttering under her breath, "Thy Empire come, thy will be done, on Equus as it is in Sanctum Solar. Amen."\n\nAurora Shinespark gathered herself and thanked the God-Empress for another day in the Empire. Turning around, she reached out with her orange magic to take her inquisitor's cloak. She fastened the dark red and orange cloak to her back, and she brushed down her dark orange and brown mane.\n\n "Sol Invicta, archmage!" one of the inquisitors cried as she left her room. Aurora returned the greeting and sat down. The rest followed suit.\n\nDuring breakfast, they poured over various letters and documents that had been scattered across the table. Manehattan was a special case in the Empire. As it was the primary production base, the citizens were allowed slightly more freedoms than other cities. The Manehatten chapter was tasked with maintaining Harmony and Order in the city, especially against communist infiltration.\n\n"There is a rally today in Slavation Plaza protesting conditions in the uniform factories," a creamy unicorn with tan spots stated.\n\n "Very well," Aurora answered after taking a bite of food. "Fidelis Flamma and Novus Flux! Attend the protest and ensure that no heretics provoke a riot." She turned back to the first pony. "Is there any news on the potential Harmonist terrorist cell?"\n\n"No, archmage," the inquisitor replied. "The Speculatores have returned no new information. The corruption grows deeper, but they are unable to find the source."\n\n"Worrisome," Aurora murmured. Before she could continue, the door to the chapter house opened and a messenger arrived, out of breath from a long travel. "Speak," she barked.\n\n"Aurora Shinespark," he began, gathering as much pomp as he could muster. "You have been summoned to Sanctum Solar. The Empress wishes to speak with you concerning grave matters. You will depart for the holy city at once.""
  solar.1.a:0 "What does the Empress require of me?"
  solar.2.t:0 "Heresy Abounds"
  solar.2.d:0 ""What does the Empress require of me?" Aurora pondered as she approached the entrance to Daybreaker's throne room. Guards of the Solaris Militarium roved the halls, their hooves clanking on the exposed stonework.\n\nFlanking her on either side were a pair of inquisitors, their harsh glares making her feel like she was on trial for heresy. As they creaked open the massive bolted doors, they announced her presence. Waves of heat hit her, instantly causing her to break out into a sweat.\n\nAt the far end of the room, easily a hundred feet distant, the God-Empress sat on her throne, unmoving and watching Aurora with brown and yellow cat-like eyes. She looked to the two guards stationed either side the steps to her throne. "Leave us," she stated and her guards instantly obeyed.\n\nAurora prostrated herself on the marble floor, waiting for Daybreaker's stern yet soft command to rise. When she did, she briefly met the Empress's gaze, but she quickly averted her eyes. It was like Daybreaker could see every thought Aurora had.\n\nClicking her tongue, Daybreaker turned Aurora's face back toward her and she stated in a soothing voice, "Fear not, Aurora. I have a task for you." She smiled and faced the great bay window overlooking the spires and towers of Sanctum Solar.\n\nAurora gulped as she observed Daybreaker. Her armor glittered in her sun, the orange and gold reflecting sharply back into Aurora's eyes. As she approached, Daybreaker snarled and growled, "I have sacrificed much to protect Harmony and Order in MY Empire, and yet my own generals repay me with heresy!" Her mane pulsed a few flashes of violent purple and blue before returning to its normal orange.\n\nHer brow crinkled in anger, she stomped a hoof on the ground and barked, "You are the first of a few inquisitors that will be tasked with rooting out this heresy once and for all!" Holding up a hoof, she added, "But first, you will be dispatched to Trotsville."\n\nAs Aurora tilted her head in confusion, Daybreaker ruffled her wings and she stated, "The Solaris Speculatores has discovered it has ben harboring heretics for months. They were offered mercy, to turn over their vermin, but refused. Punish them by Holy Fire, for it is the only solution to Chaos."\n\nWalking past Aurora, she settled back down on her throne and waved a hoof dismissively. "When you return, you can deal with the heretics in the Militarium. For now, Trotsville is your target. May the Fires of My Sun aid you, Archmage."\n\nBowing, Aurora replied, "The Holy Flame shall guide me." She quickly departed, her first thought the need for a shower."
  solar.2.a:0 "I shall not fail you, my Empress!"
  solar.3.t:0 "Rooting Out Corruption"
  solar.3.d:0 "Thunderbolt Sentinel observed the small hamlet of Trotsville from the skies. "It's just part of the job," he thought, taking a deep breath and fighting back the growing lump in his stomach that was trying to move its way up his throat.\n\n"I suppose it was going to catch up to me at some point," he mused to himself, looking back at the archmage. Aurora Shinespark, or some such, Daybreaker's inquisitor to ensure he stayed loyal. They all sounded alike. All looked similar, too. She noticed the older stallion watching her and returned it with a stern glare. Shuddering, he turned back to look at the approaching hamlet. He could sense the piercing golden eyes of the archmage still focused on him.\n\nSighing, he turned and faced Aurora. Her white fur stood out against the deep oranges and reds of her cloak, and ornate rings decorated her horn. After a moment of silence, the two eying each other cautiously, he finally asked, "How do you it?"\n\nHer expression remained unchanged, and she spoke in the condescending manner as a mother would with a wayward foal. "It is a simple decision. Harmonist agitators were discovered and the citizens refused to arrest them. The Empress has decreed that—"\n\n"Yes, that all those who do not abide by true Harmony and Order are heretics." Thunderbolt finished, trying hard not to derisively spitting out the last word. "My question is: how do you condemn innocent ponies to die?"\n\nShaking her head, her deep orange mane swaying with the motion, she said, "Would you not sacrifice a few thousand innocents for the salvation of millions more? If heresy is not stamped out at the roots where it grows, it will spread to other towns. It will then spread to the cities, before reaching Sanctum Solar itself."\n\nWith a scowl, she got within inches of Thunderbolt's face. Fire as bright as the Empress' Sun shone in her eyes as she continued, "This decision is never done lightly, and I pray the souls of those who are truly loyal to the Empress will find peace in the next life."\n\nShe motioned at the pilot, who opened the bombardier doors. Below, the small houses of Trotsville began to zoom past, a few specks visible to Thunderbolt: ponies going about their day without any idea of what was going to happen.\n\n"Do not look away, Thunderbolt Sentinel. Remember the price of heresy." Aurora cantered past the general and observed out the cockpit window as the squadron unleashed their payloads on the hamlet below.\n\nThere was a bright flash, and soon heat began to assault his face. Flames began spreading across the streets of Trotsville and the screams of those who were unfortunate enough to be caught in the napalm blast reached his ears. Whether out of fear or regret, he could not say, he watched as flames engulfed the hamlet. The price of heresy. The price of challenging Daybreaker's rule."
