  solar.1.t:0 "Thy Will be Done"
  solar.1.d:0 "Light poured through the simple windows of the room. It was small, square, and sparsely decorated. A basic cot was on one corner, and a small wardrobe filled with cloaks and robes was open. In the center of the room, facing into the sunlight and muttering under her breath, a small white unicorn basked in the warmth of Daybreaker's sun.\n\n"Oh Goddess, hallowed be thy Sun," she began praying aloud. To her, the sunshine coming in the from window wasn't just signifying a new day: it was Harmony and Order itself, cleansing her mind of any impure thoughts and healing her body of any harm caused by the darkness of Night.\n\nShe spread herself out on the floor, prostrate toward the window. "As your Sun purifies the world with its light, so too, let it purify our actions. Forgive us our daily sins and lead us not into heresy. Protect us from the forces of Chaos and Disorder, and strengthen our resolve against the heretic. May the fires of your wrath bring swift destruction to your foes. Give us this day the victory against the enemy!"\n\nSlowly, the unicorn got to her hooves, muttering under her breath, "Thy Empire come, thy will be done, on Equus as it is in Sanctum Solar. Amen."\n\nAurora Shinespark gathered herself and thanked the God-Empress for another day in the Empire. Turning around, she reached out with her orange magic to take her inquisitor's cloak. She fastened the dark red and orange cloak to her back, and she brushed down her dark orange and brown mane.\n\n "Sol Invicta, archmage!" one of the inquisitors cried as she left her room. Aurora returned the greeting and sat down. The rest followed suit.\n\nDuring breakfast, they poured over various letters and documents that had been scattered across the table. Manehattan was a special case in the Empire. As it was the primary production base, the citizens were allowed slightly more freedoms than other cities. The Manehatten chapter was tasked with maintaining Harmony and Order in the city, especially against communist infiltration.\n\n"There is a rally today in Slavation Plaza protesting conditions in the uniform factories," a creamy unicorn with tan spots stated.\n\n "Very well," Aurora answered after taking a bite of food. "Fidelis Flamma and Novus Flux! Attend the protest and ensure that no heretics provoke a riot." She turned back to the first pony. "Is there any news on the potential Harmonist terrorist cell?"\n\n"No, archmage," the inquisitor replied. "The Speculatores have returned no new information. The corruption grows deeper, but they are unable to find the source."\n\n"Worrisome," Aurora murmured. Before she could continue, the door to the chapter house opened and a messenger arrived, out of breath from a long travel. "Speak," she barked.\n\n"Aurora Shinespark," he began, gathering as much pomp as he could muster. "You have been summoned to Sanctum Solar. The Empress wishes to speak with you concerning grave matters. You will depart for the holy city at once.""
