  ###Leader Descriptions###
  POLITICS_DAYBREAKER_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: At least 2000 BLB\n\n§YBiography§!: For eons, the land of Equestria was protected by two sister alicorns to rule over the day and night. Their serene guidance helped establish strong ties between ponies, forming harmony that lasted for generations to come. Little is known where the sisters, Celestia and Luna, originated from. In their early rule, many venerated them as gods before they were kindly corrected.\n\nThe harmony of Equestria would not last, however, as the Great War of 1011 would shatter the idyllic outlook of her ponies. Out of this chaos, Daybreaker would emerge. She answered the call, overpowering what sanity Celestia had left to provide the final solution to her problems: unending, overwhelming firepower.\n\nDaybreaker is everything Celestia was not: pompous, arrogant, self-centered, aggressive. Her ponies are merely tools to her, the Solaris Adoratio (Solar Cult), the outlet to keep their fears at bay. Despite the decades since the collapse of the great Solar Empire, many still worship at her hooves, and Imperial society is one of endless adoration and sacrifice. Daybreaker cares little beyond one day reclaiming her rightful place as ruler, not just of the lands of Equestria, but one day the world. All will worship the sun, and Daybreaker will be the herald of their salvation.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Twotail"
  POLITICS_CELESTIA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: At least 2000 BLB\n\n§YBiography§!: Long before the chaos of modern times, the land of Equestria was ruled by two sisters. One controlled the day; another controlled the night. Together, they led their ponies into an era of prosperity, peace, and happiness. These sisters, Celestia and Luna, were alicorns: powerful beings that bore the magical properties of all three species of pony. For centuries they ruled, but it would not last.\n\nLuna fell to the darkness, and Celestia was forced to seal her away in the moon, lest she destroy the world through her hubris. As Celestia was close to her sister, she grew distant and cold, plunging Equestria into a short time of intense heat. Strict laws were enacted, and her ponies chafed. At the peak of this, she reflected and saw herself repeating Luna's mistakes, and she stepped back from the precipice. This would continue for a thousand years, until Luna returned.\n\nIn the aftermath, the world experienced rapid development. Celestia believed that, with her reformed sister, they could weather the tides and live peaceful coexistence. This error in judgement cost her everything: her ponies, her country, her very self.\n\nFor forty years, she watched her alter ego, Daybreaker bring suffering to what was left of the nation of Equestria. Now that she is finally returned, she is wiser.\n\nAlthough she is much more merciful and serene than Daybreaker, her experiences have hardened Celestia's resolve. Now far more pragmatic, her kindest tendencies have faded to give way to a desire to see her wayward ponies protected from all that would threaten them. Her beloved nation, Equestria, will one day be restored, and her serene guidance will lead it into another golden era.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: flamevulture17"
  POLITICS_AURORA_SHINESPARK_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 1021 ALB\n\n§YBiography§!: One of the youngest ponies to achieve the rank of Archmage in the Solaris Inquisitionis, Aurora Shinespark grew up staunchly in the hardest portions of the Solar Empire. Raised in Manehattan, she experienced the first union riot of 1032, where she earned her cutie mark in infernal magic defending a pair of citizens from rogue workers.\n\nWhen she reached the appropriate age, she attended former Princess Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns, now Daybreaker's College for Talented Mages. Successfully reaching the rank of Mage, she was given a position as lieutenant of the former Archmage of her home city, Nebula Flare. However, Nebula Flare was declared a heretic, and fled the country, placing the fairly green Aurora in charge of the chapter.\n\nUnder her leadership, she held the peace in Manehattan, although little was done to resolve the unrest. While she can have a hoofs-off methodology, when pushed she will retaliate with appropriate force. As a loyal inquisitor, she ensures that ponies are kept in line.\n\nNow the Princess Regent, Aurora leads the nation with stern justice. Little of the entrenchment of the Adoratio and Inquisitionis in government has been addressed. Primarily, her goals are reconquest of the nation, ensuring that the position she was entrusted in follows Daybreaker's vision. The Empress' memory will be honored, and she will be venerated as the immortal, unstoppable being she is.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
  POLITICS_SUNSET_SHIMMER_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 980 ALB\n\n§YBiography§!: Once the friendship student of Celestia, Sunset Shimmer grew jealous of other ponies and their rapid advancement through Celestia's school. She was not a stupid student, in fact she was a genius, but she considered friends and spending time with them beneath her. In 999 ALB, she broke into the forbidden library of the Canterlot Palace and found her escape. She would run to another world, return with its inhabitants, and conquer Equestria, setting herself up as its new ruler.\n\nThat did not go according to plan, and she was stopped by Celestia's following student, Twilight Sparkle. Although offered a place to return to, she insisted on residing with her new friends in this new world. The honeymoon period was short, and soon Sunset began to grow irritated with many of her friends' quirks.\n\nAlthough she remained connected with them, she let them drift apart, and when Daybreaker summoned her, she answered the call. Daybreaker trained her, forging her into the first leader of the revitalized Solaris Adoratio. Replacing Padlock Key, Sunset rebuilt the order from the ground up, making it the paramilitary arm of Daybreaker's control. All aspects of public life were dictated by the priestesses and battlemages of the order.\n\nBut, she was not satisfied. The Adoratio proclaimed to be family yet did not act like it. Change was still needed, and with Daybreaker's incapacitation, she has that chance. Solar society is still strict, but it is fair. Ponies have the freedom to worship Daybreaker as they wish, and already the spark of unity in the nation is resurging. For however long she lives, Sunset will ensure the memory of both her mentors lives on, forever engrained in the culture.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
  POLITICS_BLUEBLOOD_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 978 ALB\n\nBorn to some minor nobles in Canterlot, Blueblood was originally set for a life of middling success, petitioning for new laws or other bureaucratic monotony. However, after his parents' untimely demise, something he claimed he had no part in, the former Princess Celestia adopted him and treated him as her nephew. Overnight, Blueblood was catapulted into the lap of luxury, something which has stuck with him ever since.\n\nLike his counterpart, Sunset Shimmer, he was raised to learn the ways of friendship and harmony. Usually he managed to at least appear more competent in it, which he would lord over Sunset until she disappeared. After she vanished, little motivated him to continue his studies, and he devoted more time to dabbling in war and military theory than anything else.\n\nAs tensions with the changelings grew, Celestia knew that having somepony with knowledge on war would be imperative, and he was promoted to field marshal in 1010. Troops under his command soon complained of the pedantic nature of his requests, as he usually squandered supplies meant for the front lines.\n\nHowever, he was kept, and after Daybreaker's ascension, was given the title of Lord Commander of the Solaris Militarium, giving him near total control over the general army of the Solar Empire. Daybreaker still could pull rank over him, and this caused both to butt heads on numerous occasions. Now, with his successful coup, nopony can challenge his power.\n\nFrom his new position as Supplicant of the Empress, he has slowly started to reshape Imperial society. Despite being fat and lazy, his arrogance drives his one remaining passion: bending the citizenry to kneel before him. He, like the Empress before him, deserves total adoration, and all of the Empire will acknowledge him as Daybreaker's rightful successor.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
