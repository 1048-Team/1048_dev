  ###Leader Descriptions###
  POLITICS_DAYBREAKER_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: At least 2000 BLB\n\n§YBiography§!: For eons, the land of Equestria was protected by two sister alicorns to rule over the day and night. Their serene guidance helped establish strong ties between ponies, forming harmony that lasted for generations to come. Little is known where the sisters, Celestia and Luna, originated from. In their early rule, many venerated them as gods before they were kindly corrected.\n\nThe harmony of Equestria would not last, however, as the Great War of 1011 would shatter the idyllic outlook of her ponies. Out of this chaos, Daybreaker would emerge. She answered the call, overpowering what sanity Celestia had left to provide the final solution to her problems: unending, overwhelming firepower.\n\nDaybreaker is everything Celestia was not: pompous, arrogant, self-centered, aggressive. Her ponies are merely tools to her, the Solaris Adoratio (Solar Cult), the outlet to keep their fears at bay. Despite the decades since the collapse of the great Solar Empire, many still worship at her hooves, and Imperial society is one of endless adoration and sacrifice. Daybreaker cares little beyond one day reclaiming her rightful place as ruler, not just of the lands of Equestria, but one day the world. All will worship the sun, and Daybreaker will be the herald of their salvation.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Twotail"
  POLITICS_CELESTIA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: At least 2000 BLB\n\n§YBiography§!: Long before the chaos of modern times, the land of Equestria was ruled by two sisters. One controlled the day; another controlled the night. Together, they led their ponies into an era of prosperity, peace, and happiness. These sisters, Celestia and Luna, were alicorns: powerful beings that bore the magical properties of all three species of pony. For centuries they ruled, but it would not last.\n\nLuna fell to the darkness, and Celestia was forced to seal her away in the moon, lest she destroy the world through her hubris. As Celestia was close to her sister, she grew distant and cold, plunging Equestria into a short time of intense heat. Strict laws were enacted, and her ponies chafed. At the peak of this, she reflected and saw herself repeating Luna's mistakes, and she stepped back from the precipice. This would continue for a thousand years, until Luna returned.\n\nIn the aftermath, the world experienced rapid development. Celestia believed that, with her reformed sister, they could weather the tides and live peaceful coexistence. This error in judgement cost her everything: her ponies, her country, her very self.\n\nFor forty years, she watched her alter ego, Daybreaker bring suffering to what was left of the nation of Equestria. Now that she is finally returned, she is wiser.\n\nAlthough she is much more merciful and serene than Daybreaker, her experiences have hardened Celestia's resolve. Now far more pragmatic, her kindest tendencies have faded to give way to a desire to see her wayward ponies protected from all that would threaten them. Her beloved nation, Equestria, will one day be restored, and her serene guidance will lead it into another golden era.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: flamevulture17"
  POLITICS_AURORA_SHINESPARK_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 1021 ALB\n\n§YBiography§!: One of the youngest ponies to achieve the rank of Archmage in the Solaris Inquisitionis, Aurora Shinespark grew up staunchly in the hardest portions of the Solar Empire. Raised in Manehattan, she experienced the first union riot of 1032, where she earned her cutie mark in infernal magic defending a pair of citizens from rogue workers.\n\nWhen she reached the appropriate age, she attended former Princess Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns, now Daybreaker's College for Talented Mages. Successfully reaching the rank of Mage, she was given a position as lieutenant of the former Archmage of her home city, Nebula Flare. However, Nebula Flare was declared a heretic, and fled the country, placing the fairly green Aurora in charge of the chapter.\n\nUnder her leadership, she held the peace in Manehattan, although little was done to resolve the unrest. While she can have a hoofs-off methodology, when pushed she will retaliate with appropriate force. As a loyal inquisitor, she ensures that ponies are kept in line.\n\nNow the Princess Regent, Aurora leads the nation with stern justice. Little of the entrenchment of the Adoratio and Inquisitionis in government has been addressed. Primarily, her goals are reconquest of the nation, ensuring that the position she was entrusted in follows Daybreaker's vision. The Empress' memory will be honored, and she will be venerated as the immortal, unstoppable being she is.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
  POLITICS_SUNSET_SHIMMER_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 980 ALB\n\n§YBiography§!: Once the friendship student of Celestia, Sunset Shimmer grew jealous of other ponies and their rapid advancement through Celestia's school. She was not a stupid student, in fact she was a genius, but she considered friends and spending time with them beneath her. In 999 ALB, she broke into the forbidden library of the Canterlot Palace and found her escape. She would run to another world, return with its inhabitants, and conquer Equestria, setting herself up as its new ruler.\n\nThat did not go according to plan, and she was stopped by Celestia's following student, Twilight Sparkle. Although offered a place to return to, she insisted on residing with her new friends in this new world. The honeymoon period was short, and soon Sunset began to grow irritated with many of her friends' quirks.\n\nAlthough she remained connected with them, she let them drift apart, and when Daybreaker summoned her, she answered the call. Daybreaker trained her, forging her into the first leader of the revitalized Solaris Adoratio. Replacing Padlock Key, Sunset rebuilt the order from the ground up, making it the paramilitary arm of Daybreaker's control. All aspects of public life were dictated by the priestesses and battlemages of the order.\n\nBut, she was not satisfied. The Adoratio proclaimed to be family yet did not act like it. Change was still needed, and with Daybreaker's incapacitation, she has that chance. Solar society is still strict, but it is fair. Ponies have the freedom to worship Daybreaker as they wish, and already the spark of unity in the nation is resurging. For however long she lives, Sunset will ensure the memory of both her mentors lives on, forever engrained in the culture.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
  POLITICS_BLUEBLOOD_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 978 ALB\n\nBorn to some minor nobles in Canterlot, Blueblood was originally set for a life of middling success, petitioning for new laws or other bureaucratic monotony. However, after his parents' untimely demise, something he claimed he had no part in, the former Princess Celestia adopted him and treated him as her nephew. Overnight, Blueblood was catapulted into the lap of luxury, something which has stuck with him ever since.\n\nLike his counterpart, Sunset Shimmer, he was raised to learn the ways of friendship and harmony. Usually he managed to at least appear more competent in it, which he would lord over Sunset until she disappeared. After she vanished, little motivated him to continue his studies, and he devoted more time to dabbling in war and military theory than anything else.\n\nAs tensions with the changelings grew, Celestia knew that having somepony with knowledge on war would be imperative, and he was promoted to field marshal in 1010. Troops under his command soon complained of the pedantic nature of his requests, as he usually squandered supplies meant for the front lines.\n\nHowever, he was kept, and after Daybreaker's ascension, was given the title of Lord Commander of the Solaris Militarium, giving him near total control over the general army of the Solar Empire. Daybreaker still could pull rank over him, and this caused both to butt heads on numerous occasions. Now, with his successful coup, nopony can challenge his power.\n\nFrom his new position as Supplicant of the Empress, he has slowly started to reshape Imperial society. Despite being fat and lazy, his arrogance drives his one remaining passion: bending the citizenry to kneel before him. He, like the Empress before him, deserves total adoration, and all of the Empire will acknowledge him as Daybreaker's rightful successor.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

  solar.1.t:0 "Thy Will be Done"
  solar.1.d:0 "Light poured through the simple windows of the room. It was small, square, and sparsely decorated. A basic cot was on one corner, and a small wardrobe filled with cloaks and robes was open. In the center of the room, facing into the sunlight and muttering under her breath, a small white unicorn basked in the warmth of Daybreaker's sun.\n\n"Oh Goddess, hallowed be thy Sun," she began praying aloud. To her, the sunshine coming in the from window wasn't just signifying a new day: it was Harmony and Order itself, cleansing her mind of any impure thoughts and healing her body of any harm caused by the darkness of Night.\n\nShe spread herself out on the floor, prostrate toward the window. "As your Sun purifies the world with its light, so too, let it purify our actions. Forgive us our daily sins and lead us not into heresy. Protect us from the forces of Chaos and Disorder, and strengthen our resolve against the heretic. May the fires of your wrath bring swift destruction to your foes. Give us this day the victory against the enemy!"\n\nSlowly, the unicorn got to her hooves, muttering under her breath, "Thy Empire come, thy will be done, on Equus as it is in Sanctum Solar. Amen."\n\nAurora Shinespark gathered herself and thanked the God-Empress for another day in the Empire. Turning around, she reached out with her orange magic to take her inquisitor's cloak. She fastened the dark red and orange cloak to her back, and she brushed down her dark orange and brown mane.\n\n "Sol Invicta, archmage!" one of the inquisitors cried as she left her room. Aurora returned the greeting and sat down. The rest followed suit.\n\nDuring breakfast, they poured over various letters and documents that had been scattered across the table. Manehattan was a special case in the Empire. As it was the primary production base, the citizens were allowed slightly more freedoms than other cities. The Manehatten chapter was tasked with maintaining Harmony and Order in the city, especially against communist infiltration.\n\n"There is a rally today in Slavation Plaza protesting conditions in the uniform factories," a creamy unicorn with tan spots stated.\n\n "Very well," Aurora answered after taking a bite of food. "Fidelis Flamma and Novus Flux! Attend the protest and ensure that no heretics provoke a riot." She turned back to the first pony. "Is there any news on the potential Harmonist terrorist cell?"\n\n"No, archmage," the inquisitor replied. "The Speculatores have returned no new information. The corruption grows deeper, but they are unable to find the source."\n\n"Worrisome," Aurora murmured. Before she could continue, the door to the chapter house opened and a messenger arrived, out of breath from a long travel. "Speak," she barked.\n\n"Aurora Shinespark," he began, gathering as much pomp as he could muster. "You have been summoned to Sanctum Solar. The Empress wishes to speak with you concerning grave matters. You will depart for the holy city at once.""
  solar.1.a:0 "What does the Empress require of me?"
  solar.2.t:0 "Heresy Abounds"
  solar.2.d:0 ""What does the Empress require of me?" Aurora pondered as she approached the entrance to Daybreaker's throne room. Guards of the Solaris Militarium roved the halls, their hooves clanking on the exposed stonework.\n\nFlanking her on either side were a pair of inquisitors, their harsh glares making her feel like she was on trial for heresy. As they creaked open the massive bolted doors, they announced her presence. Waves of heat hit her, instantly causing her to break out into a sweat.\n\nAt the far end of the room, easily a hundred feet distant, the God-Empress sat on her throne, unmoving and watching Aurora with brown and yellow cat-like eyes. She looked to the two guards stationed either side the steps to her throne. "Leave us," she stated and her guards instantly obeyed.\n\nAurora prostrated herself on the marble floor, waiting for Daybreaker's stern yet soft command to rise. When she did, she briefly met the Empress's gaze, but she quickly averted her eyes. It was like Daybreaker could see every thought Aurora had.\n\nClicking her tongue, Daybreaker turned Aurora's face back toward her and she stated in a soothing voice, "Fear not, Aurora. I have a task for you." She smiled and faced the great bay window overlooking the spires and towers of Sanctum Solar.\n\nAurora gulped as she observed Daybreaker. Her armor glittered in her sun, the orange and gold reflecting sharply back into Aurora's eyes. As she approached, Daybreaker snarled and growled, "I have sacrificed much to protect Harmony and Order in MY Empire, and yet my own generals repay me with heresy!" Her mane pulsed a few flashes of violent purple and blue before returning to its normal orange.\n\nHer brow crinkled in anger, she stomped a hoof on the ground and barked, "You are the first of a few inquisitors that will be tasked with rooting out this heresy once and for all!" Holding up a hoof, she added, "But first, you will be dispatched to Trotsville."\n\nAs Aurora tilted her head in confusion, Daybreaker ruffled her wings and she stated, "The Solaris Speculatores has discovered it has ben harboring heretics for months. They were offered mercy, to turn over their vermin, but refused. Punish them by Holy Fire, for it is the only solution to Chaos."\n\nWalking past Aurora, she settled back down on her throne and waved a hoof dismissively. "When you return, you can deal with the heretics in the Militarium. For now, Trotsville is your target. May the Fires of My Sun aid you, Archmage."\n\nBowing, Aurora replied, "The Holy Flame shall guide me." She quickly departed, her first thought the need for a shower."
  solar.2.a:0 "I shall not fail you, my Empress!"
  solar.3.t:0 "Rooting Out Corruption"
  solar.3.d:0 "Thunderbolt Sentinel observed the small hamlet of Trotsville from the skies. "It's just part of the job," he thought, taking a deep breath and fighting back the growing lump in his stomach that was trying to move its way up his throat.\n\n"I suppose it was going to catch up to me at some point," he mused to himself, looking back at the archmage. Aurora Shinespark, or some such, Daybreaker's inquisitor to ensure he stayed loyal. They all sounded alike. All looked similar, too. She noticed the older stallion watching her and returned it with a stern glare. Shuddering, he turned back to look at the approaching hamlet. He could sense the piercing golden eyes of the archmage still focused on him.\n\nSighing, he turned and faced Aurora. Her white fur stood out against the deep oranges and reds of her cloak, and ornate rings decorated her horn. After a moment of silence, the two eying each other cautiously, he finally asked, "How do you it?"\n\nHer expression remained unchanged, and she spoke in the condescending manner as a mother would with a wayward foal. "It is a simple decision. Harmonist agitators were discovered and the citizens refused to arrest them. The Empress has decreed that—"\n\n"Yes, that all those who do not abide by true Harmony and Order are heretics." Thunderbolt finished, trying hard not to derisively spitting out the last word. "My question is: how do you condemn innocent ponies to die?"\n\nShaking her head, her deep orange mane swaying with the motion, she said, "Would you not sacrifice a few thousand innocents for the salvation of millions more? If heresy is not stamped out at the roots where it grows, it will spread to other towns. It will then spread to the cities, before reaching Sanctum Solar itself."\n\nWith a scowl, she got within inches of Thunderbolt's face. Fire as bright as the Empress' Sun shone in her eyes as she continued, "This decision is never done lightly, and I pray the souls of those who are truly loyal to the Empress will find peace in the next life."\n\nShe motioned at the pilot, who opened the bombardier doors. Below, the small houses of Trotsville began to zoom past, a few specks visible to Thunderbolt: ponies going about their day without any idea of what was going to happen.\n\n"Do not look away, Thunderbolt Sentinel. Remember the price of heresy." Aurora cantered past the general and observed out the cockpit window as the squadron unleashed their payloads on the hamlet below.\n\nThere was a bright flash, and soon heat began to assault his face. Flames began spreading across the streets of Trotsville and the screams of those who were unfortunate enough to be caught in the napalm blast reached his ears. Whether out of fear or regret, he could not say, he watched as flames engulfed the hamlet. The price of heresy. The price of challenging Daybreaker's rule."

  military_genius_desc:0 "Starlight Glimmer, though never formally trained, adapted quickly the necessities of war. From her years of leading a cult, she can make ponies do many things they never thought they could. However, at her age, it comes at a cost, and she is unable to sway as many effectively at one time."
  stage_performer:0 "Stage Performer"
  stage_performer_desc:0 "Trixie Lulamoon's background as a traveling performance artist has given her a sharp wit. Although it has been years, the fast reflexes and scrappy attitude it gave her are engrained in her being. Add a natural charisma, and Trixie can lead ponies to the gates of Tartarus without them batting an eye, even if worn to the bone."
  not_stonks_genius:0 "Military "Genius""
  not_stonks_genius_desc:0 "Blueblood was raised in luxury and he lives in luxury.

  solaris_adoratio:0 "Adoratio Priestess"
  solaris_adoratio_desc:0 "The worship branch of the Solar Cult. This leader believes faithful worship will provide victory in the face of the enemy. Time spent worshiping is not time spent preparing for battle, however."
  solaris_inquisitionis:0 "Inquisitor"

Although she does not push her soldiers, and in fact attempts to minimize their losses on the attack, they fight with ferocity to hold their ground, and she takes a personal touch in praying for those wounded."
  morning_star:0 "Morning Star"
  morning_star_desc:0 "A shining example of the the ideal Inquisitor, Nova Glow leads her troops with cold-hearted efficiency, bringing them into battle after battle with little in the way of respite.

  crushing_death:0 "Crushing Death"
  crush_death_desc:0 "As a gravitar, Quasar Pulse is an incredibly powerful and incredibly violent pony. Like many of her uniquely touched kind, the gravity manipulation powers have slowly twisted her emotional and mental state, making her prone to lashing out and punishing her subordinates for simple fumbles. Because of this, her soldiers fight fiercely and with loyalty, although the fear she instills pushes many past their limits."
