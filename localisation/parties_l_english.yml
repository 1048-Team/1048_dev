 solarism_desc:0 "Solarism is the religion of the ancient Solaris Adoratio, dedicated to the veneration, worship, and deification of Princess Celestia. Maligned during Celestia's millennia-long rule, after her corruption and ascension as Daybreaker Sun, the Solaris Adoratio was instated as the official religion and ideology of the Solar Empire. Any thought that does not agree with Daybreaker's is heresy. Heresy is punishable by death. Death by Holy Flame."
