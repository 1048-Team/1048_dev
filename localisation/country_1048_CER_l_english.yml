  ###Leader Bios###
  POLITICS_SUNNY_STARSCOUT_1048_DESC: "§YBorn§!: 1023 ALB\n\nA foreigner to the Princessdom of Central Equestria, Sunny Starscout is the daughter of one of the many heretic families of the Solar Empire. Born in Maritime Bay, she barely had time to learn to speak and walk or make friends and relations with ponies before she and her parents, Argyle Gust and Cheer Blossom were forced to flee at the hooves of the Inquisitionis.\n\nFor weeks they managed to evade Daybreaker's forces, and made their way south to the Princessdom, one of the last bastions of Harmony on the continent. As they reached the proximity of the borders, they were nearly captured by a Militarium patrol. In the escape, Cheer Blossom was killed before Sunny's eyes, and the foal watched her mother perish in her hooves.\n\nBarely evading the patrol, the two of remaining ponies ultimately ended up in the small town of Bridlewood, along the edge of the Princessdom's domain. For weeks, Sunny was unable to process the fate of her mother. In the aftermath, Argyle noticed that she began to mumble and hold conversation with herself, although she never showed outward sign of mental trauma.\n\nHowever, Sunny grew into a passionate, seemingly-healthy young mare who believed full-well in the superiority of Harmony and friendship. Along the way, she met and befriended two other natives to the town, Izzy Moonbow and Hitch Trailblazer. Despite it all, she grew to see that ponies were not working enough on friendship and magic, and she grew to protest the slightest perceived faults with the town. Mostly, she was seen as a harmless and slightly unstable activist, as she rarely broke down into rambling rants between herself.\n\nHowever, with she and her friends' assassination of Copper Fetlock, she now is in control of the Princessdom. As she preaches about safety, harmony, peace, and friendship from the castle, she remains reclusive and obsessed with the former Elements of Harmony. More frequently she has been encountered holding arguments with herself, supposedly with the different Element-bearers and her disagreements with their policies.\n\nDespite her instability, there is one overarching directive in all her decrees: Ponies are to make friends, and their diversity is their strength. Everypony shall be unique and skilled in a craft. For when everypony is special, nopony will be.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Bubblepurity"

  easily_startled_desc:0 "Always on edge, potentially because of the consistent stream of sugary confections that she eats, Sugar Moonlight is incredibly twitchy. However, her accomplishments due to this constant fear of being attacked by \"those Solarists\" means that she is frequently able to have her troops ready for war at a moment's notice. So long as they don't mind being watched at all hours of the day."
