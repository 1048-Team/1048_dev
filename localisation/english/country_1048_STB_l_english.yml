  STB_hero_worship_desc:0 "Everything in [STB.GetNameDef] is due to the tireless efforts of Lucky Star. From the revolution against the Solar Empire to the decision to leave the floundering nation that [BAL.GetLeader] claims to run, we must only thank him for his efforts. Nothing can stop him! He will will never let us down!"
  STB_industrial_economy:0 "Industrialized Center"
  STB_industrial_economy_desc:0 "[STB.GetNameDefCap] was one of the primary industrial centers of [BAL.GetNameDef], and produced much of the steel and metalwork within the Peninsula.

Even with increased conscription in our loyal subjects, this will take more than time to fully resolve."

  ###Unit Leader Traits###
  hero_of_the_revolution:0 "Revolutionary Hero"

Simply serving under him in battle is enough to drive troops to push themselves beyond normal limits, almost to the point of super-ponies. Ponies can ignore the piles of bodies left behind. They're not important."

  ###Decisions###
  STB_DEM_elections_category:0 "The Democratic Process"
  STB_DEM_elections_category_desc:0 "Since the fall of Equestria, Stableside has not had an open and fair governmental system maintain control for more than a month. Many ponies are unfamiliar with such concepts as free elections and voting on decisions, but there are a few that have taken up the mantel to direct our assembly. We are not like other harmonist nations: all our decisions are based on majority vote, with no in-between. All our elections, if they could be called that, are for choosing who will be the lead elder at these assemblies to guide them and to propose certain policies which can be decided upon. Despite the equality everypony has, the race can still be fierce, even if it's only a two year term. Whoever wins will have the most sway at meetings, and more than likely partially dictate the future of [STB.GetNameDef]."
