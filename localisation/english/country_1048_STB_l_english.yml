They're not important."

  ###Country Leader Descriptions###
  POLITICS_FH_VASILIY_WHEATIN_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! 23rd of August, 973 ALB\n\n§YBiography:§! Many ponies would call Vasiliy Wheatin a relic, a pony from a bygone era when the idealistic blood of early Markists ran red on the streets of oppressive bourgeoisie streets. The world has moved on, the situation on its stage too complex and dangerous for the misguided ideals of Caramel Marks herself. When in an age of strength and iron hooves, the idea of completely public land ownership and workers liberation is nothing more than a pipe dream, but one that Vasiliy knows well.\n\nFrom a young age in the Lightway Collective, Vasiliy strove for equality between the capitalist land owners and the workers who still had to run the farms. Modern equipment in the Severyanan region was scarce, due to the former royal families hoarding the wealth for themselves. Of the few cities with factories, they were unsafe and filled with pollutants, while the managers and robber barons lived in luxury. Before he even received his cutie mark, he organized with others to protest the conditions and raise attention in Canterlot, which were ignored for years.\n\nWhen Steel Stallion led his revolution against the oppression of the monarchy, Vasiliy was quick to join his ranks and fight on the front lines, which earned him a position of influence within the new party after the revolt was successful. As one of the closest members of the Stalliongradian revolution, he frequently met with Sinister Serov and Altidiya after Steel Stallion's death, and later with only Sinister after Altidiya passed. When Sinister was chosen by the Supreme Soviet, his fellow comrade supported him.\n\nBut in time it was clear that Sinister was nothing but a wolf in sheep's clothing. Capitalist "compromises" crept in to "fix" the economy. Privatization returned in full force, and ponies were forcefully conscripted to prepare for the supposed liberation of Equestrian workers. But what was the liberation going to be? To serve under the same master, but in a different coat was unacceptable, and in 1017, after Stalliongrad's failed invasion of Equestria, he attempted to oust Sinister from power, as a traitor to the Revolution. However, with his growing paranoia, Sinister caught wind and nearly ended succeeding in an assassination.\n\nThe failed attempt with an ice pick left Vasiliy scarred and with little choice than to flee. The nascent socialist republic of Stableside seemed a safe haven, which was where he resided for years, albeit under the nose of COBSOC. With the South-East in disarray and Stableside falling to chaos, the determined and driving Vasiliy has taken its reins. Although a relic, that does not mean he is without bite. Sometimes, the oldest dogs have the best tricks.\n\n§YPortrait By:§!"

  STB_DEM_elections_category_desc:0 "Since the fall of Equestria, Stableside has not had an open and fair governmental system maintain control for more than a month. Many ponies are unfamiliar with such concepts as free elections and voting on decisions, but there are a few that have taken up the mantel to direct our assembly. We are not like other harmonist nations: all our decisions are based on majority vote, with no in-between. All our elections, if they could be called that, are for choosing who will be the lead elder at these assemblies to guide them and to propose certain policies which can be decided upon. Despite the equality everypony has, the race can still be fierce, even if it's only a two year term. Whoever wins will have the most sway at meetings, and more than likely partially dictate the future of [STB.GetNameDef].\n\nSmiling Embrace: [?STB_DEM_candidate_1_support]%                          Jade Turf: [?STB_DEM_candidate_2_support]%\nLiberty Bell: [?STB_DEM_candidate_3_support]%                                   Clean Sweep: [?STB_DEM_candidate_4_support]%"

Although Lucky Star has kept our core territory of Stableside quite secure, the resources that the Governorate had are not available to him. In this inesecapable weakness, an organization known as the Order of the Equestrian Diarchy has gained momentum. They seek to undo everything that has been accomplished by COBSOC and now Lucky star and restore the flawed Equestrian system. So far, their efforts have been mostly subversion, but their movement mirrors the guerilla actions taken in our own war of independence from the Solar Empire. They will continue to spread like a cancer while we gain new land and must be kept from gaining tractions. However, too harsh a response could only drive more ponies to their cause. If Lucky can prove his worth to the nation, their approval among the populace will shrivel until it dies completely."
