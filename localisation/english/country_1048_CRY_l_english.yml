  POLITICS_CADENZA_1048_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 26th of August, 972 near Vanhoover\n\nOriginally a pegasus, Princess Mi Amore Cadenza ascended to the throne of the Crystal Empire in a wave of turmoil. Shortly after her wedding with Twilight Sparkle's brother, Shining Armor, in 1002, the Crystal Empire returned, plagued by its former ruler King Sombra's magic. It was left a floundering nation, without purpose or guidance while the Crystal Heart remained elusive. After finding it through various traps and magical hexes placed by Sombra, bringing the Crystal Empire back to its former glory.\n\nIn the aftermath, Cadance and her husband were acknowledged as the nation's rightful rulers, especially after Cadance's bloodline was traced back to the ancient Princess Amore. However, Cadance's victory over their former dictator was one of her only successes. The Empire was woefully behind other modern nations, and Equestria offered guidance in return for maintaining a strong presence in the Empire. While this was seen as acceptable, there was always a sliver of resentment in the populace.\n\nStaying out of the war with the changelings, Cadance hoped that she would have more time to build her forces, her economy, and assist Celestia. Instead, she found the Empire a refuge for ponies fleeing the shattered remains of her home country, desperate to avoid persecution under Daybreaker. Her princess peers soon formed a council with her, to guide the Empire together, even if she remained de facto leader.\n\nShortly after Equestria's truce, Chrysalis forced the Crystal Empire to sign a reparations treaty to pay economic damages wrought by the 1002 Canterlot War. Since then, the economy has been teetering and unrest has been slowly building between citizens and refugees. Disastrous military campaigns against the fledgling Solar Empire left the coffers depleted and the army in disarray.\n\nThe years have not been kind to Cadance. While immortal like the other alicorns, the many hours of stress have taken a toll on her appearance, and her rule has been nothing but a string of failures. But as the last bastion of Harmony on Equus, she continues to keep hope alive for ponykind. Will her light shine for all, or will it be consumed by the darkness and be forever snuffed out?\n\n§YPortrait By§!: RyanBoi"
  POLITICS_LUNA_1048_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: At least 1500 BLB\n\nThe younger of the two original alicorn sisters, Princess Luna's past is still partly shrouded in mystery. For over a thousand years, she was trapped in the moon as punishment for her attempted coup against Celestia when she let her alter-ego, Nightmare Moon, corrupt her thoughts and twist them against her sister. When she returned, she brought eternal darkness for a few days before being restored by Twilight Sparkle and her friends.\n\nWhile for the first couple of years after her return, Luna found it difficult to accept herself, she eventually saw reason and moved past the worst of her mistakes. However, integrating into modern society was still a challenge for her, as she still had fresh memories of olden times of candlelight, back-breaking manual labor, and early bedtimes.\n\nHowever, by the start of the Great War in 1011, Luna had adapted well enough and, always having a taste for war compared to Celestia, led successful campaigns against the changeling forces. Despite that, Equestrian forces were still outnumbered and outgunned, and Celestia recalled her to help coordinate defensive lines across the remainder of the battle.\n\nCelestia was cold to her, and Luna could sense something moving inside her. Although she tried, she was unable to prevent Daybreaker from taking control of Celestia, and Luna organized a full retreat of loyalist forces to Ponyville, where she and Twilight held out until they could evacuate as many harmonists as possible.\n\nNow in refuge in the Crystal Empire, Luna's already serious and cool demeanor has grown impatient and confrontational. For over thirty years, she has seen refugees from her former kingdom flood into the Empire, and nothing has been done to adequately resolve the issue at its source: Daybreaker herself. While she held at one point a sliver of hope to Celestia's restoration, she knows it is useless. There is only one way to truly cure a monster: death.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
  POLITICS_TWIGGLES_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 20th of May, 984 in Canterlot\n\nTwilight Sparkle has led an interesting life. From a young age, she was the protegee of Princess Celestia during the final years of Equestria's life. In her early years, she studied as much as she wanted, enjoying the benefit of being the brightest and most privileged of all Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorn's students. However, the greatest lesson that Celestia wanted to instill was a difficult one. Reclusive and introverted, Twilight preferred spending time alone than wasting it with friends.\n\nIn 1000 ALB, her studies led her to believe that Nightmare Moon would soon be returning to exact vengeance. Her warnings were apparently ignored by Celestia, who instructed her instead to head to Ponyville to prepare for the summer solstice. Without Twilight's knowledge, this was Celestia's final attempt to teach her friendship. Celestia's gambit paid off, and Twilight and a group of ponies utilized the long-lost Elements of Harmony to rid Princess Luna of Nightmare Moon's influences.\n\nAfter Luna's purification, Twilight remained in Ponyville, learning more about friendship and forming deeper relationships with her new comrades. In 1003, she perfected an ancient spell by Star Swirl the Bearded, earning her the title of Princess of Friendship. Over the following years, Twilight converted many villainous creatures to the side of Harmony, earning her friends among the ranks of Starlight Glimmer, Sunset Shimmer, Discord, and others. In 1008 ALB she formed a new school dedicated to Friendship, which quickly flourished in the pre-Great War world.\n\nHowever, her idyllic view would be challenged by the Great War. Friendship dissolved, Harmony shattered. As a princess of Equestria, she was recalled to Canterlot to help guide the war effort, aiding scientific research in many areas. When Daybreaker came to power, her worldview was decimated. Her great teacher fell to evil, to corruption, and she could do nothing to stop it.\n\nWhile she and Luna attempted to keep Equestria alive, they eventually had to flee to refuge to the Crystal Empire along with the Elements of Harmony. As the decades went on, Twilight tried numerous times to determine what went wrong with Celestia, to no avail.\n\nOnly confusion rests in Twilight's mind now, leaving her restless and paranoid about the future. If Celestia could fall to evil, anypony could, and friendship could be destroyed forever. While she is still stable for now, the Sparkle family's neuroticism has been accentuated by her brother Shining's ill-health, and there is little to indicate if she could stay together if pressed. To her, the magic of friendship is always a hair's breadth away from breaking for good, and she is the only way to keep the world from falling to darkness.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
  POLITICS_FLURRY_1048_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 9th of January, 1006 in the Crystal City\n\nPrincess Flurry Heart has known nothing about the world prior to her existence. For her, chaos and disorder, suffering and death have been commonplace since as long as she can remember. Even within her very first week after birth, the Crystal Empire nearly perished after the Crystal Heart that protected it from the elements was shattered not by another enemy, but herself.\n\nIn the aftermath of the healing of the Crystal Heart, she was placed under the care of Sunburst, who instructed her for her first few years in understanding and controlling her magic. As another member of the Sparkle family, she was a bright student and quickly caught on to most techniques that Sunburst taught with little issue. Only a few holes were made in the Crystal Palace in the process.\n\nAt the age of five, the Great War broke out between Equestria and the changeling hordes under control of Queen Chrysalis. As she grew, she could see the harmony and love between ponies slowly fade and die in Equestria, causing her to question her teachers on why something like that could even happen.\n\nAfter the war, she continued to grow and learn, although she lacked much of the experience of her elder princesses. Her parents pampered her to try and keep her happy, and it only caused her to have a naiver look on life. This naivete caused her to lead a small campaign to attempt to rescue the royal yak family when Yakyakistan was invaded by Erwin Highhill of the newly formed Western Griffonian Empire. It resulted in the death of Rutherford and his family as she walked into Highhill's ploy through the mountains of Yakyakistan, ruining its chances of ever returning as a nation.\n\nWith the extent her political knowledge tied what she has learned in her studies, she holds a simple belief that there is still good within Daybreaker. From the tales of the Element Bearers, she believes that those mystical artifacts can purify Celestia as they once did Luna. Additionally, they could be used to heal the divide in Crystal society, that she is all too aware of with her subconscious connection to the Crystal Heart.\n\nWhile the other princesses claim that her approach is too innocent and ignorant, she knows that doing what is right isn't always what is easy. If she has to ignore her family, then so be it, as everypony deserves a chance at redemption. Even fallen dictators who persecute their own ponies.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: RyanBoi"
  POLITICS_NMM_1048_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: At least 1500 BLB\n\nNightmare Moon is the corrupted personality of Luna, her desire for good and justice twisted until it is nothing but a thirst for vengeance and conquest. Nopony would be safe from her watchful gaze, using the very dreams of others to discern their thoughts and their intent for the future. At least, that is what the old tales claimed about Nightmare Moon. They were only partly correct.\n\nLike Daybreaker, Nightmare Moon is the alter-ego of Luna. Over a thousand years ago, Luna was overwhelmed with the suffering that many of the fourth pony tribe of thestrals was facing at the hands of their brethren and the shunning she and they received. Many thestrals in their dreams cried for an escape, a way to live without the torture of the prejudice they received by their fellow ponies.\n\nAt the time, Luna was far brasher and confronted Celestia about the treatment. But when Celestia cautioned patience and a slow, gradual reform through the governmental system, Luna could not handle it. The entity, the spirit, of Nightmare Moon whispered to her and she succumbed, donning darker fur and the batlike wings of her special charges. For her first, misguided act, she planned to teach others to respect the beauty of her night, through its eternal existence.\n\nBut she was not to succeed. Celestia utilized the Elements of Harmony to banish Luna to the moon, where she waited in solitude for a millennium. When she did return, the corruption of Nightmare Moon was laid to rest by Twilight Sparkle and her friends. In the aftermath, it was thought Nightmare Moon was a thing of the past, and the threat of eternal night would never return.\n\nHowever, Nightmare Moon was not vanquished. Merely placed into a dormant state in Luna's mind, she has watched the last forty years unfold. With Luna's growing stress at sole leadership, her offer to assist in the coming confrontation with Daybreaker was accepted. A much wiser pony than before, little has been determined about her true motives for returning, but she appears to seek fairness for ponykind. Even if that fairness is at the receiving end of a bullet.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Twotail"
  CRY_1048_SHINING_ARMOR_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 3rd of December, 972 in Canterlot\n\nAs another member of the Sparkle family, Shining Armor was blessed with an interesting life. In 1002 ALB, he was almost sucked dry of his love and life by Chrysalis, only being rescued at the last moment by his fiancée Cadance. Afterwards, he became the prince consort and commander of the Crystal Empire's forces once it returned from its thousand-year exile.\n\nWhen war broke out with the changelings and Equestria, he advised Cadance to stay out. The Crystal Empire was not yet ready, but if Equestria could hold for a while, they would be prepared to strike. He never received his chance, as Equestria sued for peace in 1014.\n\nIn the following years, he tried twice to liberate the shattered remains of Equestria from Daybreaker, both times failing miserably leading to considerable damage to the Crystal Empire's armies. In 1029, an uprising of communists received support from Stalliongrad, leading to a short war with the neighboring country. In the battles, he was wounded in the chest, forcing him from the front lines of battle.\n\nBy 1040, his health began to decline, with little sign for what the underlying cause was. Sometimes bedridden for days or weeks at a time, the once lively Shining Armor is a shell of his former self. One can only speculate how his eventual death will affect the Crystal Empire, or his family.\n\n§YPortrait By:§! ruhje"
  CRY_1048_BIPEN_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 10th of October, 987 near Totonki Unktli\n\nBipen was like many thestrals who once lived in the south-east of Equestria: she lived her life peacefully and mostly isolated from the normal pony population, content to spend her nights working on different artisan crafts that could sometimes be sold to traders nearby. War was something that never seemed a possibility to her, despite the prejudice that she and her family faced on the odd time she traveled into town.\n\nHowever, the call went out for all ponies of Equestria—of all the tribes—to join and defend the land they called home against the changeling threat. For the first couple of years, Bipen let the others fight and die, but as she learned of some of her village's members banding together to enlist, she took the plunge as well, to hopefully guard Luna on the frontlines as well as Harmony itself.\n\nShe never got the chance to push back against the changelings, as Equestria was soon involved in a two-front war with Stalliongrad. Stationed there, her division was one of the few around Canterlot when Daybreaker ascended. From there, she retreated at Luna's call to Ponyville, and then ultimately the Crystal Empire, where she was placed in charge of a small portion of the remaining Night Guard.\n\nDespite all the good she helped accomplish by defending against Stalliongrad's invasion of the Crystal Empire, she has more than once expressed a longing for the jungle life back in the south-east. While she has forged a friendship—and small jealousy of—Selenite, it is no replacement for the bonds with her family back home. Some days, her soldiers question whether her feisty \"EEEEEs\" that she has been renowned for are a longing for the days of mangoes and starlit nights with her sisters, rather than a battle cry of defiance against tyranny.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
  CRY_1048_SELENITE_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 21st of December, 980 in Ayacachtli\n\nSelenite grew up as one of the \"academics,\" a group of thestrals that worked their hardest to prove to the other tribes that they were just as capable and worthy of respect as a unicorn, pegasus, or earth pony. She speaks little of her time in the universities of Baltimare, other than the of the derision she and a few of her friends faced at the time. When Luna returned, she happily signed up to be one of the first of her new Night Guard, and pioneered some early armored warfare tactics for Equestria.\n\nDuring the Great War, Selenite was usually under direct command of Princess Luna, a situation that suited her perfectly well as Luna was more open to adopting novel doctrines. When Daybreaker ascended, Selenite was in close proximity to Ponyville, and assisted Luna and Twilight's flight to the town. In the defense of Ponyville, she volunteered to stay behind to ensure that the princesses could flee safely north to the Crystal Empire.\n\nFor days she managed to hold the majority of Daybreaker's forces off although her commanding officer, field marshal Speck ended up killed in some of the fighting. With her left in charge of the remaining troops, she ultimately made a controlled withdrawal, although not without giving the solarist troops some departing gifts in the form of rigged explosives.\n\nWhen she finally arrived in the Crystal Empire, she was promoted to field marshal in place of Speck, and left in charge of the Nightmare Guard. Compared to her friend Bipen, Selenite is much more serious from years of responsibility, and generally keeps a level head in battle. Working with Luna, she has gone through multiple scenarios over the years on retaking the Solar Empire, and she and the princess are confident that the time is drawing near when it will be a reality, and thestrals can finally prove their equality with the other tribes.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
  CRY_1048_TEMPEST_SHADOW_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 12th of July, 977 in Ponyville\n\nFormerly a general for the Storm King, Fizzlepop Berrytwist, also known as Tempest Shadow, has led soldiers for the majority of her life. When she was injured by an Ursa Minor as a filly, ostracization prompted her to flee Equestria and seek her own destiny apart from others. After running across the Storm King and falling for his promises of healing her horn, she became second-in-command of his forces, although since she was one of the only ones with any tactical sense, which in effect placed her in total control of the Storm Kingdom.\n\nThose plans came shattering down literally when the Storm King was defeated, but thanks to the friendship of Twilight Sparkle, she was pardoned. While Harmony budded in her heart, she placed herself in exile to inform all the former territories of the Storm King of their new freedom, and to spread the joyous word of Harmony wherever she went. When she returned to Equestria to aid in the Great War, it was with fervor and zeal that she defended the nation that welcomed her back.\n\nNo amount of ingenuity could save Equestria from falling, however, and she reluctantly retreated with Twilight and Luna to the Crystal Empire, where she continued her service in protecting Harmony in the Crystal Army. She quickly worked her way up the ranks to be one of the foremost generals, effectively outranked only by Shining Armor and Selenite. In the war against Stalliongrad, she earned the nickname "Harmonic Terror" for her viciousness against the communist hordes.\n\nAfter leading division after division against the threats to Harmony and the ponies who forgave her, she took upon the mantle of her old name, Tempest Shadow once again. In the line of duty, she sacrificed everything, including more of her body itself, supplemented with magical prosthetics when injured.\n\nAs a master of guerilla warfare, she has delved into the former Equestrian lands time and again to stir up rebellion against the changelings. For the time being, she has returned to the Crystal Empire to recover, and to keep her pledge to protecting Harmony. Not until all tyrants have been overthrown will she rest, for the Harmonic Terror will visit all those who seek to oppress the weak and helpless.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Rutkotka"

  crystal.9.d:0 "It was a surprisingly warm and sunny day. The sun shone brightly and there were only a few clouds in the sky: in other words, it was the perfect weather to go outside for a picnic.\n\nInstead, four alicorns sat in Cadance’s solar, including the eponymous princess herself. The months of preparation that Cadance had sunk into making this meeting happen had thankfully paid off: they were all here, they had all agreed to at least listen to each other, and they all wanted to come to a solution.\n\n\"So,\" Cadance began with a smile, \"before we start, does anyone have a topic they want to discuss first? Otherwise, I’ve made a short list of things I’d like to talk about with you all.\"\n\n\"I have something,\" Luna replied, sweeping her gaze over the room before resting directly on Cadance. \"Regardless of whatever we all decide, it is imperative that the military receive more funding. It is horrendously behind and the current state of affairs cannot continue!\" She stomped a hoof for emphasis.\n\nBefore Cadance could open her mouth to reply to that, Flurry, bearing a furious scowl, stepped in. \"The military? How about we improve the lives of the citizens first?!\" she said sharply. \"Why do you think there are protestors outside?\"\n\n\"Stalliongradian sympathisers,\" Luna quickly replied, dismissing the charge with an indignant hoofwave.\n\n\"They should be shown the ways of Friendship!\" Twilight jumped in. \"If we can just reconcile with these ponies...\"\n\nLuna whipped her head around to glower at Twilight. \"And how do you propose to do that? They are advocating a removal of the monarchy!\"\n\nWith an irate groan, Flurry interjected, \"If you had just listened to me-\"\n\n\"ENOUGH!\" Cadance bellowed, drowning out the arguing of the other three alicorns and causing all of them to freeze mid-shout. Having gotten their attention, she sat down and stared sternly at them. \"This,\" she continued, \"is exactly why we are here, and why I made a list. Now, we are going to go through the topics I gathered one by one, and we will be civil about it.\""
  crystal.9.a:0 "Is that understood?"
  crystal.10.t:0 "The Morning Flurries"
  crystal.10.d:0 "Life in the Crystal Empire could be many things. Generally, it was considered cold but pleasant. Even the Crystal Heart could only do so much against the wiles of nature, after all.\n\nSo, winter coats and clothes were practically always in demand once autumn rolled in, as ponies of all ages made their way to their local tailor or clothing store to buy something that would keep them warm on the streets.\n\nFrom Hearthome in the south to the shores of the Green Lake at Hedgewards to the spires of Crystal City herself, ponies lived through winter after winter like this. It was, generally, considered to be a situation all benefited from.\n\nIt was now, of course, mid-winter, and as such the run on coats had slowed down substantially; whoever could own a coat already did so, and few needed a new one in the middle of the season.\n\nSo, it was quite a surprise for Snowy Skies, a tailor in Crystal City, to see a guest without a coat entering her store. Curious, she walked over and asked, \"Can I help you... Oh!\" Her words died as she recognized her guest.\n\nPrincess Flurry Heart gave a slight, reassuring smile to the smaller pegasus. \"I think you can. I would like to buy a new coat.\"\n\n\"A-as you wish, your Highness,\" Snowy Skies managed to get out. \"Did you have anything specific in mind?\" She’d never had such a high-class client in her store before, so she was quite surprised and more than a little nervous.\n\n\"Something simple and comfortable,\" the princess replied easily. \"I already have enough elaborate cloaks in my closet, I want something that wouldn’t be out of place in the streets.\"\n\nWhat the princess did with her time was none of Snowy Skies’ business, of course, so she did not ask any other questions. \"Of course, of course. I, uh, I am afraid I don’t have any coats in your size.\" She anxiously smiled. \"Would you mind if I took your measurements?\"\n\nFlurry nodded and grinned. \"Go ahead.\"\n\nThe measuring was over before Snowy Skies knew it; of course, that didn’t mean they were done yet. \"Are there any colours you would like?\"\n\n\"Light yellow and ice blue, please.\"\n\n\"Material?\"\n\n\"Wool, please.\" Flurry gave her another disarming smile.\n\nSnowy Skies jotted it down. \"That is everything, your highness. It shall be ready post-haste!\"\n\n\"Take your time,\" the princess stated with a dimissive wave of a wing. \"No need to rush.\"\n\nWith that said, she departed from the shop, leaving a still-shocked Snowy Skies behind."

For years now our land and air forces (obviously we lack any sort of naval capacity without a coastline to our name) have been neglected. They have been underfunded (though not on purpose) and are technologically behind on our enemies, to say nothing of our doctrine.\n\nWe have compiled a few suggestions from the general staff and military experts within our government, and have come up with a few possible options.\n\n- Focus on increasing the size of our army and giving them better equipment to fight with, at the cost of other elements such as tanks or artillery. This would simplify our production of weaponry but also make casualties far more likely.\n\n- Focus on overwhelming our enemies through firepower. This would require artillery to become much more common than it currently is in our forces, and would put more strain on our logistics, as well as movement in the field. Still, there is little that can survive even a few minutes of consistent shelling.\n\n- Focus on overwhelming our enemies through speed. The Changeling blitzkrieg tore through Equestria in the Great War, and it has proven to be successful. But tanks are expensive to produce, and in rough terrain or places where there is little in the way of roads and rails, our soldiers could experience severe difficulties.\n\n- Sharpen our current doctrine to perfection - personally advocated by Prince Shining Armor. So far, we have survived with our current tactics and strategies, and so have many other nations. Of course we must deal with the issues of the outdated equipment and stubborn commanders, but if we can get past those obstacles, there is nothing preventing us from continuing as we have.\n\nAll these options have their pros and cons, but everyone can agree that change is necessary no matter what. So, what route shall we pick?"
