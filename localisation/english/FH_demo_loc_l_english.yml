  fh_demo_news.20.d:0 "[THIS.GetNewspaperHeader]Farbrook, unifier of the Hill Pony nations, was a backwater on the world stage until recently. Having pushed back and taken over the exiled River Federation, the Kingdom of Farbrook set their eyes south. Using the distraction caused by the three way war on Griffonia, Farbrook launched an attack on the River Union, pushing steadily into the Riverlands. In the aftermath of their conquest, Farbrook has been met by much resistance, by ponies and other creatures who worry that they'll be exploited. Today, to calm fears, the King of Farbrook held a new coronation, in Rejikograd. In a grand ceremony, a new crown was placed upon his head, and the Kingdom of Farbrook was declared a thing of the past. For now, a Kingdom of Ponies rules the east. Upon being questioned why he chose to still be a King instead of an Emperor, the King responded "Look west, for the fate of emperors in this land.""
  #fh_demo_news.20.d:0 "[THIS.GetNewspaperHeader]Since it repelled the landing of its former allies turned would-be-invaders, [FBK.GetNameDef] has steadily taken advantage of any situation that it could find to unify the ponies and other creatures of the Riverlands under one banner. Although outnumbered by [RCT.GetNameDef] and the griffons, [FBK.GetLeader] has led [FBK.GetLeader.GetHerHis] forces to victory against [RCT.GetLeader] and restored peace to the Riverlands. As a sign of respect and to assuage fears that [FBK.GetLeader.GetSheHe] will be like [RCT.GetLeader], [FBK.GetLeader] was crowned as the River Ponies' new monarch. While some protested outside, [FBK.GetLeader] has promised prosperity and freedom for [FBK.GetLeader.GetHerHis] new subjects. When questioned about the choice to remain a kingdom, [FBK.GetLeader] was quoted as saying, "You need only look west to see the fate of all emperors.""
