  ###Leader Descriptions###
  POLITICS_SCORCHED_EARTH_1048_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: August 2nd, 1009 ALB\n\n§YBiography§!: Scorched Earth grew up in a world where there was no memory of harmony and love between ponies. At the tailwind of the \"Placated Generation,\" all of his earliest memories are nothing but war and suffering, as first changelings, then communists ripped across the battered Equestria and nearly caused its collapse.\n\nIn the first months of the Great War, his family fled from some of the pegasi cloud settlements near the changeling border to the relative safety of the Canterlot region. When Daybreaker ascended, Scorched Earth was little more than a young colt obsessed with the war stories of returning veterans of the "War with the Bugs." In the ensuing years, he enlisted into the rebranded Solaris Militarium and saw action on the front lines against the South-East, whenever incursions from the various communist cells crossed the thin border between the nations.\n\nWorking his way through the ranks, he achieved the position of major after only a few short battles, all of which were ended by decisive, planned action from troops under his command. For a time, he worked with fellow officer Solar Strike to quell some nascent heretics in the central region of the Solar Empire before returning to Ordo Maris to work with its archmage, Ion Trail, and keep the peace. Over time, however, he grew more irritated with the growing decadancy of the Empire, and made no qualms about voicing his displeasure.\n\nWith the advent of the South-East's crumbling and his own assessment that the Solar Empire has become too fat and lazy to effectively accomplish anything, he has taken a page from Solar Strike. Having marched his army of the 4th Glorious Flame and many volunteers who agree with his view on the Solaris Adoratio out of the Empire, he has established a new order in a basecamp in former communist territory.\n\nTrue to his name, Scorched Earth has aggressively subdued the local population, and instituted martial law while destroying much of what has been deemed "excessive luxury". With heretics routinely executed and all sources of entertainment or relaxation ending up banned, life is questionably better under nominal Imperial rule than Cobalt Hoof. However, subjugating the entire South-East for Daybreaker is Scorched Earth's goal, and if it cannot be won, then it can burned to the ground instead.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: OpalRadiance"
  POLITICS_LUMINOUS_BLADE_DESC:0 ""
  POLITICS_WARM_NIGHT_DESC:0 "§yBorn§!: July 21st, 1014 ALB\n\nAs a pony who grew up in the worst decade of the Empire's existence, Warm Night has experienced both the lows and highs of life under Daybreaker. Raised in a border town of little influence with the Empire and the eventual South-Eastern Governorate, she was exposed to the propaganda of the Adoratio from an early age, whose purported blessings conflicted with her family's existence.\n\nBeing the eldest daughter in her family, she was left with watching her two younger siblings while her parents toiled for hours supporting the Militarium's supply routes as the Empire fought for control of the South-Eastern peninsula. When one of the branches of the Adoratio opened a church school within the town, she was sent to learn the necessities to help her parents. Instead, a passion was ignited for using the resources of the Adoratio to truly help others, a desire that sometimes conflicted with the requirements of correction within the Order.\n\nDespite consistent disagreements, she received a commission to remain in the region of Mareway, with the intent that she would learn from her superior, Serene Shore, a mellowed fire for aid that would be tempered with the teachings of the Adoratio. After reaching Mareway, she organized different charity events, which while popular with the citizenry, started to breed additional unorthodox or heretical thought within them.\n\nRarely is an Adoratio priestess allowed to deviate far without correction from the Inquisitionis, but with Mareway's relatively unimportant location, her thoughts and ideas continued to grow, which she eventually convinced a number of her fellow priestesses to follow. To her, Daybreaker, being the supreme alicorn that she is, is obligated to help the other ponies with a firm, but gentle hoof that has yet to be displayed. Heresy would surely disappear if ponies followed her out of true love rather than fear.\n\nAs she learned of COBSOC's disastrous policies in the South-East, her heart turned toward its ponies and their eventual liberation. When Serene Shore agreed to support Scorched Earth's expedition as a theological guide, Warm Night soon became his strongest critic of his policies. However, until she is able to apply her own at the head of Militem Solar, what she says is only hot air in the breeze, and it will remain a theory if Solarism can really support everypony, faithful or not."
  POLITICS_PINPOINT_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: February 20th, 1017 ALB\n\nArchmage Pinpoint is a rather obscure inquisitor within the ranks of the Solaris Inquisitionis. Little is known about her beyond her date of birth and the town from which she supposedly was born, and any attempts to delve further have been unsuccessful. Rumors abound based on her sometimes erratic, frequently obsessive behavior that she is one of the fabled and feared gravitars, ponies that can meld gravity itself to their magic's power, that rarely appear within the Empire.\n\nInformation is inconclusive on if she was born in Maretime Bay, and if she was, when she left or when she studied to become an inquisitor. Coincidental evidence of a gravitar born within the town comes from news reports of a family found dead in their house after it virtually imploded in a freak accident. When the Inquisitionis quickly responded, it was deemed a microburst of wind and that all were lost, although reports indicate there was a single child that was never found.\n\nAlthough she infrequently speaks of her achievements, Pinpoint has always been upfront with her passion for study and her unfailing love for Daybreaker. Countless hours of hers have been spent perfecting religious science, straddling the line between heretical progress and research to further glorify the God-Empress. An all-consuming passion, like many inquisitors, is to eradicate heresy, but she wishes to go to the source. A source that she has no idea where it resides.\n\nAs the head researcher of the Militem expedition, she has extensive resources at her command, and her inner circle of likeminded, inquisitive and faithful inquisitors, have kept the nation knowledgeable but pure of corruption. Occasional requests for prisoners for experimentation are but a small price to pay to keep up with neighboring nations.\n\nObsessive, mildly paranoid, and fervently loyal to Daybreaker, Pinpoint has mercilessly decreed that she will be the destroyer of heresy, forever. Whether it can be cured with little damage to ponies remains to be seen. But that is only the cost of unwavering, undying love for the immortal God-Empress."

  ###Opening###
  MTS_siege_new_horseleans:0 "The Siege of New Horseleans"
  MTS_siege_new_horseleans_desc:0 "We have been repelled by the forces of [BAL.GetNameDef], short many miles from Baltimare. We cannot return to [EQS.GetNameDef] with nothing to show for our insubordination, but we cannot stay wanderers for long. The port city of New Horseleans should prove the perfect spot to establish our new capital."
  MTS_cracking_new_horseleans:0 "Cracking the City"
  MTS_cracking_new_horseleans_desc:0 "Despite [BAL.GetNameDef] abandoning all the heretics in the city, New Horseleans has proven resistant to our attack. However, there are unguarded sections that we can push through, and no matter our losses, we will take this city in the name of the Empress!"
  MTS_cauterize_rebels:0 "Cauterize Those that Resist"
  MTS_cauterize_rebels_desc:0 "Unsurprisingly, the ponies of New Horseleans have not taken well to our occupation. However, we have the deck in our favor, since we hold the weaponry. It's time to use some of the ammunition to make a point, and reduce the number of mouths that will need to be supported later."
  MTS_warning_example:0 "Warn Through Examples"
  MTS_warning_example_desc:0 "There were numerous officers and soldiers who remained in New Horseleans to coordinate the defense, but most of the defenders were untrained ponies who were pressed to fight for their homes. One of Serene Shore's priestesses, Warm Night, advocates that they be spared, but the professionals punished, as a warning for any future rebels that we will not tolerate sedition."
  MTS_permanent_temporary_base:0 "Permanent Temporary Basecamp"
  MTS_permanent_temporary_base_desc:0 "Since New Horseleans is still devastated from our capture and subsequent punishment, there are few suitable locations for our forces to establish themselves. Keeping our troops near the edge of the city will allow quick responses to either unrest or impending attacks. It'll only be temporary, anyway."
  MTS_host_first_service:0 "Host the First Services"
  MTS_host_first_service_desc:0 "Not priestesses of the Adoratio have traveled with us, since the theology of [MTS.GetNameDef] is considered "heterodox," and therefore, not actively encouraged by the fat heads in Sanctum Solar. However, the contingent under Serene Shore have proven amenable to our ideals, and are already starting to instruct the basics of an ascetic lifestyle to the citizens."
  MTS_establish_inquisitor_teams:0 "Establish Inquisitor Teams"
  MTS_establish_inquisitor_teams_desc:0 "Only a few inquisitors dared to defy Lady Inquisitor Quasar Pulse and the Empress to travel with us, but they have already proven instrumental in maintaining order within New Horseleans. Now that resistance is spreading outside the city, it is time for Archmage Pinpoint to organize hunter-seeker groups to eliminate these before they become a threat."
  MTS_crack_down_on_thestrals:0 "Crack Down on Thestrals"
  MTS_crack_down_on_thestrals_desc:0 "As a haven of all things unclean, COBSOC had allowed the greatest insult to the Empress, the thestrals, spread out and settle in different regions. Due to their backward, tribal thinking, they have proven difficult to dislodge, but now that we have an Inquisitionis presence, we can dedicate many resources to wiping them from the face of the peninsula."
  MTS_first_faithful:0 "The First Faithful"
  MTS_first_faithful_desc:0 "Thousands have flocked to the words of Serene Shore and her priestesses and to show their desire to remain in the Empress's good graces, have volunteered to serve with us in an auxiliary capacity. These are untrained and still tainted with heretical ideals, but they could prove useful fodder when we expand to the peninsula."
  MTS_reconstruction_teams:0 "Reconstruction Teams"
  MTS_reconstruction_teams_desc:0 "There are numerous prisoners that have yet to be purified of their crimes. While we wait to uphold justice, we can use them for a benefit: There is much work that must be done to repair New Horseleans, and too few free bodies to do it."
  MTS_flush_out_jungles:0 "Flush Out the Jungles"
  MTS_flush_out_jungles_desc:0 "Some of the fledgeling resistance groups have taken shelter within the thick canopies of Hayseed Swamp and its surrounding jungles, harassing our garrisons that have been established in the largest settlements and otherwise inflicting casualties that we cannot replace. Thankfully, we don't need to actually search for them when burning them out will be just as effective."
  MTS_eliminate_commissars:0 "Eliminate Old Commissars"
  MTS_eliminate_commissars_desc:0 "Although most of the forces of COBSOC fled when the government collapsed, some stayed in the city to organize defenses against any potential attacks or uprising. These commissars are few in number, but hold much influence in fighting-aged ponies, and could prove to be a problem if allowed to live for much longer, which requires that we deal with them. Now."
  MTS_necessary_sacrifices:0 "Necessary Sacrifices"
  MTS_necessary_sacrifices_desc:0 "At the moment, ponies are reluctant to give up what few luxuries they have to focus all they can on the Empress and the prize that is promised in her. They cling to their trinkets and baubles like shiny pearls that will fade in only a short time, hindering our ability to mobilize for war. We must cut them off immediately, so they can learn to survive with what is strictly needed."
  MTS_solar_pressers:0 "Solar Pressers"
  MTS_solar_pressers_desc:0 "There is still much that can be done to shore up our position within the South-East, as we require many more bodies to supplement our forces, but also further development of infrastructure to mobilize for the war effort. Sending gangs of our soldiers into the cities to recruit new ponies will not be popular, but it is something that we must do if we want to survive. They might not, though."
  MTS_labor_for_empress:0 "Labor for the Empress"
  MTS_labor_for_empress_desc:0 "Although they can be used for vain accessories, the region in which we find ourself in is filled to the brim with natural resources that can be put toward our impending war with the other breakaways. However, with limited capacity for modern refining, for now, we will require of our citizens they sacrifice their time to improve our production lines, whether they want to or not."
  MTS_first_step:0 "The First Step"
  MTS_first_step_desc:0 "Now that many are primed for the ideas of [MTS.GetNameDef], it should be only a simple speech that will lead many to realizing the joy of simple lifestyles and training for conflict from Scorched Earth. The reduced strain on our industry will be a boon for reconstruction, as well as the reclaimation that could be done with their trinkets."
  MTS_first_bridge:0 "The First Bridge"
  MTS_first_bridge_desc:0 "To entice more ponies to learn about Daybreaker and her demands, Warm Night has proposed that we establish some community shelters for those most afflicted. Although it won't directly simplify their lifestyle, those that find aid there could be asked to assist with some of the building projects that are planned for the future, with the promise of shelter once done."
  MTS_theological_debates:0 "Theological Debates"
  MTS_theological_debates_desc:0 "The differences between Scorched Earth and Warm Night have reached a boiling. Word has just reached that the priestess is going to confront the General in his quarters. We can only hope that the guards arrive in time."

  MTS_heretic_test_subjects_category_desc:0 "§RHeresy§! has been rampant in the Solar Empire and its rightful territories for decades and the Inquisitionis has yet to destroy it, no matter how much the Empress or the Lady Inquisitor have strived. Clearly, there is something deficient within the population of Equus itself that drives them to defile Daybreaker's holy land. As a pony of knowledge, §YArchmage Pinpoint§! has dedicated herself to ridding this blight from the land through other, more invasive means than simple burnings. She will eliminate heresy at its source: the very minds of the ponies themselves!\n\nIn our quest to eradicate heresy, we will require many test subjects. We must acquire as many as we can find, so that we may study them and what behooves them to defy the Empress while they are utilized to further our research and weaponry.

  MTS_project_sunrise_desc:0 "It has never been explicitly stated why fire is the appropriate way to cleanse heresy. Using all that fuel and magical energy could be better served elsewhere in the Inquisitionis. Unless, of course, there is some merit to the idea. This will require some in depth testing."
  MTS_project_kinesis:0 "Project Kinesis"
  MTS_project_kinesis_desc:0 "Archmage Light Jolt has proposed that various kinetic and ballistic tests be performed on heretics to see if we could figuratively punch the heresy out of ponies. Although it is unlikely to succeed in its stated purpose, there is still merit in how to more efficiently end a heretic's life in this research."
  MTS_project_guardian:0 "Project Guardian"
  MTS_project_guardian_desc:0 "Earth ponies are the most common of the three pony races and also the most durable and conservative. Many have sworn fealty to the Empress, but many more are likely to fall to heresy and rebellion within their lifetime, even if they were not born before the Empress ascended. This requires additional probing."
  MTS_project_mage:0 "Project Mage"

  MTS_project_aero:0 "Project Aero"
  MTS_project_aero_desc:0 "Since the invention of the aeroplane, machines and pegasi have been at strict odds with each other, although the pegasi still had the upper hoof in agility and flight efficiency. With many of subjects being pegasi, it is best if we dig into their secrets. Free thoughts while flying could lead to heresy."
  MTS_project_hereticus_start:0 "Begin Project Hereticus"
  MTS_project_hereticus_start_desc:0 "After diving into the deepest and darkest secrets of pony physiology and psychology, Archmage Pinpoint has determined that most of her research can be applied to the primary problem: heresy.
