  ###Leader Descriptions###
  POLITICS_SCORCHED_EARTH_1048_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of August, 1009 near Whitebell\n\n§YBiography§!: Scorched Earth grew up in a world where there was no memory of harmony and love between ponies. At the tailwind of the \"Placated Generation,\" all of his earliest memories are nothing but war and suffering, as first changelings, then communists ripped across the battered Equestria and nearly caused its collapse.\n\nIn the first months of the Great War, his family fled from some of the pegasi cloud settlements near the changeling border to the relative safety of the Canterlot region. When Daybreaker ascended, Scorched Earth was little more than a young colt obsessed with the war stories of returning veterans of the "War with the Bugs." In the ensuing years, he enlisted into the rebranded Solaris Militarium and saw action on the front lines against the South-East, whenever incursions from the various communist cells crossed the thin border between the nations.\n\nWorking his way through the ranks, he achieved the position of major after only a few short battles, all of which were ended by decisive, planned action from troops under his command. For a time, he worked with fellow officer Solar Strike to quell some nascent heretics in the central region of the Solar Empire before returning to Ordo Maris to work with its archmage, Ion Trail, and keep the peace. Over time, however, he grew more irritated with the growing decadancy of the Empire, and made no qualms about voicing his displeasure.\n\nWith the advent of the South-East's crumbling and his own assessment that the Solar Empire has become too fat and lazy to effectively accomplish anything, he has taken a page from Solar Strike. Having marched his army of the 4th Glorious Flame and many volunteers who agree with his view on the Solaris Adoratio out of the Empire, he has established a new order in a basecamp in former communist territory.\n\nTrue to his name, Scorched Earth has aggressively subdued the local population, and instituted martial law while destroying much of what has been deemed "excessive luxury". With heretics routinely executed and all sources of entertainment or relaxation ending up banned, life is questionably better under nominal Imperial rule than Cobalt Hoof. However, subjugating the entire South-East for Daybreaker is Scorched Earth's goal, and if it cannot be won, then it can burned to the ground instead.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: OpalRadiance"
  POLITICS_LUMINOUS_BLADE_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 23rd of April, 1020 in New Canterlot\n\nIf ponies in the Solar Empire think of an inquisitor, it is likely that an image close to Luminous Blade comes to mind. Although she is of a younger generation than that of the first inquisitors, she is no less their equal in piety, zealotry, and devotion to Daybreaker and purging darkness from wherever it may be hiding in the Solar Empire, or elsewhere on Equus.\n\nWhen Luminous was growing up, the Empire was in its final process of fracturing. Chaos was rampant in the distant fringes of Daybreaker's territory, and she and her family evacuated from the town that would later become New Canterlot to the heart of the Empire, to settle in Ponyville. From there, she was given a relatively sheltered life, as her parents mistrusted most of the citizenry there, after numerous incidents of heresy and subsequent retaliations from the Inquisitionis. However, no shielding would prevent her from receiving the stories of the brave inquisitors as they fought to protect the Empire, entrancing her with ideals of glory underneath Daybreaker.\n\nAs she reached her late teens, she applied for the few spots allowed for public admission into Daybreaker's School for Blessed Unicorns, although she was ultimately rejected for her average magical scores. That did not deter her, and she instead tutored under some of the acolytes in Ponyville itself, eventually earning recognition as an initiate into the Inquisitionis and placing among the other servants of Daybreaker.\n\nAt first, her innocence hindered her progress, as she was quick to trust heretics she was sent to investigate, but after multiple corrections, she was forged into a dutiful mage to keep order within the Empire. As her first true placement of duty, she was assigned to Scorched Earth's legions to keep order and root out potential heresy, although she only instead served to temper some of his most outlandish ideals.\n\nStubborn and naïve, she holds to a slightly more traditionalist mindset compared to him and frequently keeps his mission focused on clearing heresy, rather than personal crusades against all material wealth. Although she has been on record of being harsher with pegasi, she has yet to express any dislike of her superior, and faithfully serves him day in and out.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: OpalRadiance"
  POLITICS_WARM_NIGHT_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 21st of July, 1014 in Sire's Hollow\n\nAs a pony who grew up in the worst decade of the Empire's existence, Warm Night has experienced both the lows and highs of life under Daybreaker. Raised in a border town of little influence with the Empire and the eventual South-Eastern Governorate, she was exposed to the propaganda of the Adoratio from an early age, whose purported blessings conflicted with her family's existence.\n\nBeing the eldest daughter in her family, she was left with watching her two younger siblings while her parents toiled for hours supporting the Militarium's supply routes as the Empire fought for control of the South-Eastern peninsula. When one of the branches of the Adoratio opened a church school within the town, she was sent to learn the necessities to help her parents. Instead, a passion was ignited for using the resources of the Adoratio to truly help others, a desire that sometimes conflicted with the requirements of correction within the Order.\n\nDespite consistent disagreements, she received a commission to remain in the region of Mareway, with the intent that she would learn from her superior, Serene Shore, a mellowed fire for aid that would be tempered with the teachings of the Adoratio. After reaching Mareway, she organized different charity events, which while popular with the citizenry, started to breed additional unorthodox or heretical thought within them.\n\nRarely is an Adoratio priestess allowed to deviate far without correction from the Inquisitionis, but with Mareway's relatively unimportant location, her thoughts and ideas continued to grow, which she eventually convinced a number of her fellow priestesses to follow. To her, Daybreaker, being the supreme alicorn that she is, is obligated to help the other ponies with a firm, but gentle hoof that has yet to be displayed. Heresy would surely disappear if ponies followed her out of true love rather than fear.\n\nAs she learned of COBSOC's disastrous policies in the South-East, her heart turned toward its ponies and their eventual liberation. When Serene Shore agreed to support Scorched Earth's expedition as a theological guide, Warm Night soon became his strongest critic of his policies. However, until she is able to apply her own at the head of Militem Solar, what she says is only hot air in the breeze, and it will remain a theory if Solarism can really support everypony, faithful or not."
  POLITICS_PINPOINT_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 20th of February, 1017 in Ponyville\n\nArchmage Pinpoint is a rather obscure inquisitor within the ranks of the Solaris Inquisitionis. Little is known about her beyond her date of birth and the town from which she supposedly was born, and any attempts to delve further have been unsuccessful. Rumors abound based on her sometimes erratic, frequently obsessive behavior that she is one of the fabled and feared gravitars, ponies that can meld gravity itself to their magic's power, that rarely appear within the Empire.\n\nInformation is inconclusive on if she was born in Ponyville, and if she was, when she left or when she studied to become an inquisitor. Coincidental evidence of a gravitar born within the town comes from news reports of a family found dead in their house after it virtually imploded in a freak accident. When the Inquisitionis quickly responded, it was deemed a microburst of wind and that all were lost, although reports indicate there was a single child that was never found.\n\nAlthough she infrequently speaks of her achievements, Pinpoint has always been upfront with her passion for study and her unfailing love for Daybreaker. Countless hours of hers have been spent perfecting religious science, straddling the line between heretical progress and research to further glorify the God-Empress. An all-consuming passion, like many inquisitors, is to eradicate heresy, but she wishes to go to the source. A source that she has no idea where it resides.\n\nAs the head researcher of the Militem expedition, she has extensive resources at her command, and her inner circle of likeminded, inquisitive and faithful inquisitors, have kept the nation knowledgeable but pure of corruption. Occasional requests for prisoners for experimentation are but a small price to pay to keep up with neighboring nations.\n\nObsessive, mildly paranoid, and fervently loyal to Daybreaker, Pinpoint has mercilessly decreed that she will be the destroyer of heresy, forever. Whether it can be cured with little damage to ponies remains to be seen. But that is only the cost of unwavering, undying love for the immortal God-Empress.\n\n§YPortrait By:§! MonsoonVisionz"

  MTS_corporation_ordo:0 "Richness of the Peninsula"
  MTS_corporation_ordo_desc:0 "As Ordo Auctifer is situated along the rich coastline of the South-East, with the great industrial centers of Stableside and New Yukka City powering them, it continuously meets and exceeds demands from Ordo Meridian for supplies.

  MTS_immortal_fliers_desc:0 "Instead of improving their already impressive destructive capabilities, we can instead alleviate their defensive weaknesses. Even beyond that, they shall become immortal. In their aerial fortitude, we find a testament to the Empress's divine dominion, transcending mortality itself."
  MTS_bathing_fire:0 "Bathing in Fire"
  MTS_bathing_fire_desc:0 "Since we were unable to carry many of the Militarium's best supplies with us, we have had to work on developing new forms of holy napalm production. While some of our generals plan how to apply it effectively with long-range weapons, we should at least prove that our own stock is effective. Plus it will clear some of the irritating thestral villages from the map, anyway."
  MTS_prep_airfields:0 "Preparatory Airfields"
  MTS_prep_airfields_desc:0 "With dedicated airfields and staging points, our forces will launch like bolts of lightning, striking fear into the hearts of those who challenge the Empress's rule. The skies shall be prepared for her aerial conquests."
  MTS_answer_with_lead:0 "Answering with Lead"
  MTS_answer_with_lead_desc:0 "When challenged by enemy planes, we answer with lead. Our anti-aircraft weaponry shall be upgraded, ensuring that no adversary shall ascend to challenge the Empress's rule."
  MTS_holy_napalm:0 "Holy Napalm Applications"
  MTS_holy_napalm_desc:0 "We wield holy napalm, purifying the skies with its divine flames. Our aerial forces shall unleash this sacred fire, consuming the heretical and leaving the Empress's skies and lands cleansed and under her radiant light."
  MTS_future_to_realize:0 "A Future to Realize"
  MTS_future_to_realize_desc:0 "A future of triumph beckons to be realized, just as our own models beckon to constantly evolve past our enemies. As our fliers spread their wings and dominate the skies, they shape a destiny where the Empress's dominion reaches every corner of the heavens."
  MTS_light_of_empress:0 "Light of the Empress"
  MTS_light_of_empress_desc:0 "The light of the Empress begs to shine on all of our lowly foes. As our bombers cut through the clouds, perhaps we can research more efficient methods to better illuminate her domain..."
  MTS_cross_continent_destruction:0 "Cross-Continental Destruction"
  MTS_cross_continent_destruction_desc:0 "Our aerial shall cross continents, leaving destruction in its wake. From high above, our forces rain down upon our enemies, ensuring that the Empress's dominion knows absolutely no bounds."
  MTS_few_but_proud:0 "Few but Proud"
  MTS_few_but_proud_desc:0 "Although we have may have a smaller force than many nations, our pilots fight with ferocity and dedication that rivals no other. While many countries' pilots may be considered elites, ours are a cut above the rest, a true pride of [MTS.GetNameDef]. And each day, they soar into the skies with unwavering dedication and faith, knowing that in their ranks lies the unbreakable spirit of the Empress's chosen warriors."
  
  ###Industry###
  MTS_necessary_matters:0 "Necessary Matters"
  MTS_necessary_matters_desc:0 "Our industry and economy are our most necessary matters. From the heart of production to the flow of resources, we must ensure that the Empress's dominion granted to us remains fortified and prosperous."
  MTS_utilize_uncleansed:0 "Utilize the Uncleansed"
  MTS_utilize_uncleansed_desc:0 "Even these unclean lands hold value in the Empress's domain. By harnessing their labor and resources, we can strengthen our industrial foundation, converting the impure into tools of her divine will."
  MTS_sanction_holy_mining:0 "Sanction Holy Mining Towns"
  MTS_sanction_holy_mining_desc:0 "Sacred resources lie beneath the surface, awaiting our extraction. By sanctioning new holy mining towns, we can extract the wealth that can fuel the Empress's conquests."
  MTS_feed_war_forges:0 "Feed the War Forges"
  MTS_feed_war_forges_desc:0 "With our growing quotas, our forgres require much more upkeep to be sustained. With every hammer blow, we craft weapons and armaments to empower our forces, ensuring the Empress's reign endures."
  MTS_immediate_demands:0 "Immediate Demands"
  MTS_immediate_demands_desc:0 "Due to a mixture of both the incompetence of COBSOC's rule and supposed consequences of our conquest of the New Horseleans region, the demands upon our hairline infrastructure is reaching a breaking point. Strains upon our supplies of food and water will require drastic, and sometimes unpleasant, solutions. At least they'll learn how to like less quickly."
  MTS_baseline_services:0 "Baseline Services"
  MTS_baseline_services_desc:0 "Among the churn of industry, baseline services keep the gears of our construction turning. From civilian industry to military, we lay the foundation that supports the Empress's vision of unchallenged production even in our most unusable lands."
  MTS_cauterizing_wounds:0 "Cauterizing the Wounds"
  MTS_cauterizing_wounds_desc:0 "Just as the Empress's light cauterizes darkness, our industry cauterizes foul lands. Through repair and reconstruction, we mend what has been broken, changing the previously desolate into productive lands."
  MTS_expand_plantations:0 "Expand the Rubber Plantations"
  MTS_expand_plantations_desc:0 "The Hayseed Swamps we own hold an enormous amount of unused rubber, and we only manage a few plantations to extract from it. By expanding these facilities, we ensure our rubber economy flourishes and supports the Empress's tireless crusade in the South-East."
  MTS_required_luxuries:0 "Required Luxuries"
  MTS_required_luxuries_desc:0 "In an ideal world, nopony would require anything outside of the love of the Empress and serving her, however, the ungrateful masses that we have inherited have a certain "acceptable level" of living standards that, at this point, they still demand of us. If it will keep them from completely revolting, then perhaps we can provide a few trinkets."
  MTS_mechanic_machines:0 "Mechanics of the Machine"
  MTS_mechanic_machines_desc:0 "As cogs turn and gears grind, we master the mechanics of the industrial machine. With precision and expertise, we orchestrate the symphony that empowers the Empress's dominion to function flawlessly."
  MTS_redefining_expectations:0 "Redefining Expectations"
  MTS_redefining_expectations_desc:0 "At one time, ponies within the South-East believed that they could have all manner of luxuries. An extra set of clothes, some fresh nuts, or even two bars of soap at a time. These are all spurious, and by retooling our industry to more efficiently work on less, we can slowly fix their living standard issues."
  MTS_wandering_tutors:0 "Wandering Sisters"
  MTS_wandering_tutors_desc:0 "Although we have only a small number of Solaris Adoratio priestesses, we must utilize them to the best of our ability. Their leader, Priestess Serene Shore, has agreed that some of her own will be dispatched to travel around the villages and towns, providing the first pieces of true knowledge in the Empress's salvation, and priming them for learning in future waves of education."
  MTS_answering_needy:0 "Answering the Needy"
  MTS_answering_needy_desc:0 "Despite everything that we have provided for these needy and obstinate populace, they still clamor for more wants. As we are outnumbered hundreds to one here, some concessions must be made if we are to stave off complete anarchy, however, these new factories that will provide for them will come with stipulations, which they will agree to, whether they realize it or not."
  MTS_specialize_in_war:0 "Specialize in War"
  MTS_specialize_in_war_desc:0 "Our economy shall specialize in total war, providing the instruments that propel our forces to victory. Every nail and bolt, every weapon and machine, shall serve as a testament to the Empress's indomitable might."
  MTS_generalize_in_war:0 "Generalize in War"
  MTS_generalize_in_war_desc:0 "Our economy shall generalize in war, providing the instruments that will grant us the necessary versatility needed for victory. We shall adapt to various needs, ensuring that every facet of our dominion harmonizes with the Empress's grand design."
  MTS_fund_church_schools:0 "Fund Church Schools"
  MTS_fund_church_schools_desc:0 "Through church schools, we educate the young in Solarist teachings. By investing in knowledge and faith, we ensure future generations perpetuate her reign, securing her legacy even in these heretical lands."
  MTS_work_out_poverty:0 "Work Them out of Poverty"
  MTS_work_out_poverty_desc:0 "In the end, the only reason so many are poor within our nation is because of sheer laziness. COBSOC allowed them breaks, gave them time for which they could become slothful. We shall not be lenient. If ponies wish to earn the Empress's provision, they must toil for it, and dedicate their lives to her alone."
  MTS_worthwhile_riches:0 "Worthwhile Riches"
  MTS_worthwhile_riches_desc:0 "There are obscene amounts of natural resources within even our own small slice of the South-East, enough that most of it can be diverted to the military while still providing pittance for our citizens in order to keep them placated. Appointing a few overseers will ensure that lots are doled out fairly, and since they are all from our own ranks, should be immune to corruption."
  MTS_like_any_other:0 "Like Any Other"
  MTS_like_any_other_desc:0 "In the grand tapestry of economies, ours shines like any other. Yet, it is the Empress's hoof that guides our efforts, weaving her influence into every transaction and endeavor. With her blessings, we can fully prosper."
  MTS_no_more_optional_tithes:0 "No More Optional Tithes"
  MTS_no_more_optional_tithes_desc:0 "If we are to ever succeed in our conquest of the South-East, and perhaps even beyond the peninsula, we must vastly increase our income that we receive from our citizens. Although the Adoratio and Cultus are mostly outside of [MTS.GetLeader]'s influence, agreements can be made where some additional tithes are then given to the military. It will just require everypony to give, without exception."
  MTS_sweat_for_empress:0 "Sweat for the Empress"
  MTS_sweat_for_empress_desc:0 "We shall sweat for the Empress, our labors a testament to our unwavering dedication. Through hard work and industry, we fuel her vision, enabling her dominion to flourish and conquer."
  MTS_thankful_for_sustenance:0 "Thankful for Sustenance"
  MTS_thankful_for_sustenance_desc:0 "It is still mind-boggling that despite all our efforts, ponies still decry us for starving them, for driving them out of house and home. They should be thankful that they are allowed to exist at all, given their heretical history. Perhaps it is time they receive another set of instructions in humility."
  MTS_punch_above:0 "Punch Above Our Size"
  MTS_punch_above_desc:0 "We shall go even further to punch above our size, our industry defying limitations. Through ingenuity and faith, we will amplify our efforts, demonstrating that in the Empress's realm, no challenge is insurmountable."
  MTS_theology_for_masses:0 "Theology for the Masses"
  MTS_theology_for_masses_desc:0 "Theology for the masses empowers our faith, and therefore our intelligence. By disseminating the Empress's teachings, we fortify belief and solidarity, ensuring her divine influence surely resonates throughout our own dominion."
  MTS_tepid_health:0 "Tepid Health"
  MTS_tepid_health_desc:0 "We nurture tepid health, ensuring our people's well-being. A healthy dominion thrives, and by securing the physical and spiritual welfare of our citizens, we strengthen the Empress's dominion by guaranteeing a healthy and content population."

  MTS_forge_of_empires_desc:0 "Our dominion becomes a forge of empires, where industry melds with destiny. Through our labor and dedication, we become a country of smiths, shaping a realm that embodies the Empress's indomitable will."
  
  ###Opening###
  MTS_siege_new_horseleans:0 "The Siege of New Horseleans"
  MTS_siege_new_horseleans_desc:0 "We have been repelled by the forces of [BAL.GetNameDef], short many miles from Baltimare. We cannot return to [EQS.GetNameDef] with nothing to show for our insubordination, but we cannot stay wanderers for long. The port city of New Horseleans should prove the perfect spot to establish our new capital."
  MTS_cracking_new_horseleans:0 "Cracking the City"
  MTS_cracking_new_horseleans_desc:0 "Despite [BAL.GetNameDef] abandoning all the heretics in the city, New Horseleans has proven resistant to our attack. However, there are unguarded sections that we can push through, and no matter our losses, we will take this city in the name of the Empress!"
  MTS_cauterize_rebels:0 "Cauterize Those that Resist"
  MTS_cauterize_rebels_desc:0 "Unsurprisingly, the ponies of New Horseleans have not taken well to our occupation. However, we have the deck in our favor, since we hold the weaponry. It's time to use some of the ammunition to make a point, and reduce the number of mouths that will need to be supported later."
  MTS_warning_example:0 "Warn Through Examples"
  MTS_warning_example_desc:0 "There were numerous officers and soldiers who remained in New Horseleans to coordinate the defense, but most of the defenders were untrained ponies who were pressed to fight for their homes. One of Serene Shore's priestesses, Warm Night, advocates that they be spared, but the professionals punished, as a warning for any future rebels that we will not tolerate sedition."
  MTS_permanent_temporary_base:0 "Permanent Temporary Basecamp"
  MTS_permanent_temporary_base_desc:0 "Since New Horseleans is still devastated from our capture and subsequent punishment, there are few suitable locations for our forces to establish themselves. Keeping our troops near the edge of the city will allow quick responses to either unrest or impending attacks. It'll only be temporary, anyway."
  MTS_host_first_service:0 "Host the First Services"
  MTS_host_first_service_desc:0 "Not priestesses of the Adoratio have traveled with us, since the theology of [MTS.GetNameDef] is considered "heterodox," and therefore, not actively encouraged by the fat heads in Sanctum Solar. However, the contingent under Serene Shore have proven amenable to our ideals, and are already starting to instruct the basics of an ascetic lifestyle to the citizens."
  MTS_establish_inquisitor_teams:0 "Establish Inquisitor Teams"
  MTS_establish_inquisitor_teams_desc:0 "Only a few inquisitors dared to defy Lady Inquisitor Quasar Pulse and the Empress to travel with us, but they have already proven instrumental in maintaining order within New Horseleans. Now that resistance is spreading outside the city, it is time for Archmage Pinpoint to organize hunter-seeker groups to eliminate these before they become a threat."
  MTS_crack_down_on_thestrals:0 "Crack Down on Thestrals"
  MTS_crack_down_on_thestrals_desc:0 "As a haven of all things unclean, COBSOC had allowed the greatest insult to the Empress, the thestrals, spread out and settle in different regions. Due to their backward, tribal thinking, they have proven difficult to dislodge, but now that we have an Inquisitionis presence, we can dedicate many resources to wiping them from the face of the peninsula."
  MTS_first_faithful:0 "The First Faithful"
  MTS_first_faithful_desc:0 "Thousands have flocked to the words of Serene Shore and her priestesses and to show their desire to remain in the Empress's good graces, have volunteered to serve with us in an auxiliary capacity. These are untrained and still tainted with heretical ideals, but they could prove useful fodder when we expand to the peninsula."
  MTS_reconstruction_teams:0 "Reconstruction Teams"
  MTS_reconstruction_teams_desc:0 "There are numerous prisoners that have yet to be purified of their crimes. While we wait to uphold justice, we can use them for a benefit: There is much work that must be done to repair New Horseleans, and too few free bodies to do it."
  MTS_flush_out_jungles:0 "Flush Out the Jungles"
  MTS_flush_out_jungles_desc:0 "Some of the fledgeling resistance groups have taken shelter within the thick canopies of Hayseed Swamp and its surrounding jungles, harassing our garrisons that have been established in the largest settlements and otherwise inflicting casualties that we cannot replace. Thankfully, we don't need to actually search for them when burning them out will be just as effective."
  MTS_eliminate_commissars:0 "Eliminate Old Commissars"
  MTS_eliminate_commissars_desc:0 "Although most of the forces of COBSOC fled when the government collapsed, some stayed in the city to organize defenses against any potential attacks or uprising. These commissars are few in number, but hold much influence in fighting-aged ponies, and could prove to be a problem if allowed to live for much longer, which requires that we deal with them. Now."
  MTS_necessary_sacrifices:0 "Necessary Sacrifices"
  MTS_necessary_sacrifices_desc:0 "At the moment, ponies are reluctant to give up what few luxuries they have to focus all they can on the Empress and the prize that is promised in her. They cling to their trinkets and baubles like shiny pearls that will fade in only a short time, hindering our ability to mobilize for war. We must cut them off immediately, so they can learn to survive with what is strictly needed."
  MTS_solar_pressers:0 "Solar Pressers"
  MTS_solar_pressers_desc:0 "There is still much that can be done to shore up our position within the South-East, as we require many more bodies to supplement our forces, but also further development of infrastructure to mobilize for the war effort. Sending gangs of our soldiers into the cities to recruit new ponies will not be popular, but it is something that we must do if we want to survive. They might not, though."
  MTS_labor_for_empress:0 "Labor for the Empress"
  MTS_labor_for_empress_desc:0 "Although they can be used for vain accessories, the region in which we find ourself in is filled to the brim with natural resources that can be put toward our impending war with the other breakaways. However, with limited capacity for modern refining, for now, we will require of our citizens they sacrifice their time to improve our production lines, whether they want to or not."
  MTS_first_step:0 "The First Step"
  MTS_first_step_desc:0 "Now that many are primed for the ideas of [MTS.GetNameDef], it should be only a simple speech that will lead many to realizing the joy of simple lifestyles and training for conflict from Scorched Earth. The reduced strain on our industry will be a boon for reconstruction, as well as the reclaimation that could be done with their trinkets."
  MTS_first_bridge:0 "The First Bridge"
  MTS_first_bridge_desc:0 "To entice more ponies to learn about Daybreaker and her demands, Warm Night has proposed that we establish some community shelters for those most afflicted. Although it won't directly simplify their lifestyle, those that find aid there could be asked to assist with some of the building projects that are planned for the future, with the promise of shelter once done."
  MTS_theological_debates:0 "Theological Debates"
  MTS_theological_debates_desc:0 "The differences between Scorched Earth and Warm Night have reached a boiling point. Word has just arrived that the priestess is going to confront the General in his quarters. We can only hope that the guards arrive in time."
  
  ###Scorched Earth Pre-War###
  MTS_keeping_simple:0 "Keeping It Simple"
  MTS_keeping_simple_desc:0 "With Warm Night finally backing down on some of her absurd claims, it is time to turn our attention to the most pressing concern of the South-East: toppling the petty warlords and rival governments that have sprung up in the wake of COBSOC's collapse. At least there will be some easy solutions to this rather difficult problem."
  MTS_victory_with_less:0 "Victory with Less"
  MTS_victory_with_less_desc:0 "One of the first things that Scorched Earth requires be instilled to the new drafting base is that just because they will be fighting for the Empress does not mean they will be provided more, better equipment. A cunning warrior will win with what he has, and rely on his faith to get the job done, even if it has to be done with his bare hooves."
  MTS_restructure_poverty:0 "Restructure the Idea of Poverty"
  MTS_restructure_poverty_desc:0 "For decades, the ponies of the South-East were considered some of the most destitute and suffering ponies on all of Equus. However, that is not the case, for while they cry that they have been left to rot and die from lack of necessities, we must inform them that they have been prepared for this blessed moment! By having little, they will learn to be content with even less than before, and praise the Empress in so doing!"
  MTS_wealth_minimalism:0 "Wealth in Minimalism"
  MTS_wealth_minimalism_desc:0 "Architecture, factories, food, and other things do not need to be fancy, gaudy, or expensive to be effective. In fact, the simplest items are usually the most efficient, and in that, there is a wealth of blessings for anypony who looks for them. It's time we give our citizens this vital lesson so they may be prepared for the future."
  MTS_warriors_diet:0 "A Warrior's Diet"
  MTS_warriors_diet_desc:0 "One of the first things that we must do in preparation for conquering this cursed peninsula is get our recruits on a proper diet that they may be focused entirely on the Empress. COBSOC allowed them to grow decadent and fat, eating such nicities as maize or seaweed, when all they need is hay and wheat to survive. And thus, they shall be taught how to have this food, and like it."
  MTS_only_war_possessions:0 "Possesions only for War"
  MTS_only_war_possessions_desc:0 "In the short term, we can simply force our factories and our construction sites to remain prepared for funding the entirety of our liberation of the South-East. Nothing will be made for a pony's enjoyment, for everything will be meant to kill, maim, or eradicate when we march into the jungles of the peninsula."
  MTS_denying_life_rights:0 "Denying the Right to Live"
  MTS_denying_life_rights_desc:0 "The average pony believes that they are entitled to things they call "necessities," but that is something that [MTS.GetLeader] knows is ripe for perversion. Because of this, fasting will soon be implemented across all levels of society so that our new citizens can learn to deny themselves and instead focus on the Empress, like everypony should."
  MTS_forgo_needs:0 "Forgo Simple Needs"
  MTS_forgo_needs_desc:0 "Where there were once factories meant for providing basics like clothing and factory protective equipment, they are now being tooled into forges for the little requirements of an army. Boots, holsters, and other needs for a soldier will be met, but even then, they will be the minimum that is required to function, lest our own soldiers get haughty and think themselves above the Empress."
  MTS_everything_for_warrior:0 "Tool Everything for a Warrior's Hooves"
  MTS_everything_for_warrior_desc:0 "Many of the tool factories for farms or the Celestial Sea fisheries can be temporarily diverted to construct weapons for our warriors. The ensuing derth of civilian materials is no concern of ours, as they will learn to trust the Empress more to keep them alive in the wake of owning less."
  MTS_warriors_calling:0 "A Warrior's Calling"
  MTS_warriors_calling_desc:0 "Just like everypony is called to be a servant of the Empress outside of war, everypony within [MTS.GetNameDef] is called to be a warrior of the highest caliber, ready to sacrifice themselves on the battlefield in her name. Although that is the ideal, it is clear that the ponies of the South-East have grown soft from their luxuries, and we should focus on select demographics to induct into the military."
  MTS_sacrifice_everything:0 "Sacrifice is Everything"
  MTS_sacrifice_everything_desc:0 "In the perfect society, everypony will abstain from anything that could distract from the Empress. Whether that be food, clothing, housing, or even baser needs, all should be given up in service to the Empress. However, a majority of the populace isn't ready for that yet, but a select few have fully embraced our teachings, and are ready to charge into the midst of battles as our greatest shock troops."
  MTS_reconsider_extremes:0 "Reconsider the Extremes"
  MTS_reconsider_extremes_desc:0 "While it would be proper for every citizen to learn what it means to truly live with reliance on the Empress's mercy, there simply isn't enough time to properly train and prepare them, especially for some of the holiest and extreme ceremonies. For now, as suggested by Mage Luminous Blade, we shall drip-feed them theology, and they shall one day be ready."
  MTS_sanity_not_included:0 "Sanity not Included"
  MTS_sanity_not_included_desc:0 "Although many outside of [MTS.GetNameDef] would decry us as insane for our practices, they merely have been blinded by the temptations of this world. Even our very bodies can be an avenue for both sin and hedonism, so we must therefore purge any thoughts from us from time to time. There are ceremonies that are perfect for it, no matter how bloody..."
  MTS_poverty_is_a_concept:0 "Poverity is a Concept"
  MTS_poverty_is_a_concept_desc:0 "While our citizens continue to complain to us about how they have been slowly falling further into poverty, they have yet to realize, despite our instructions, that being poor is merely a state of mind. For if somepony is rich in spirit and love for the Empress, then they are rich indeed, no matter what sinful material possessions they have. For now, though, we shall humor them."
  MTS_retool_hedonism:0 "Retool Hedonistic Forges"
  MTS_retool_hedonism_desc:0 "As New Horseleans is the capital of the region of which we conquered, it is the major industrial center for this area of the South-Eastern Peninsula and therefore has many factories dedicated to keeping the citizenry placated and mentally blinded from the Empress. We shall not, though, completely demolish them all, for some could prove useful to our cause against [BAL.GetNameDef]."
  MTS_simply_war:0 "It's Simply War"
  MTS_simply_war_desc:0 "Despite our small numbers and our relatively "basic" military, we are blessed by the God-Empress herself, and our holy warriors will march across the peninsula to clear and cleanse it from all unrighteousness. Any that don't will be purged themselves."
  MTS_simply_society:0 "It's Simply Society"
  MTS_simply_society_desc:0 "While there are many steps that are still required, General Earth has successfully brought ponies on the path toward ascending to a new level with the Empress, by sacrificing all that they own to better themselves and hear the very word of the Empress. There is still much wealth and luxury in the nation, but it is a start."
  MTS_simply_economy:0 "It's Simply the Economy"
  MTS_simply_economy_desc:0 "Through our simplifying and restructing of the industrial base in New Horseleans and the surrounding region, we have turned the sluggish and sinful economy of COBSOC into a weapon that will plunge into the very heart of [BAL.GetLeader], and we shall see [BAL.GetLeader.GetHerHim] bleed!"
  MTS_introduce_holy_napalm:0 "Introduction to Holy Napalm"
  MTS_introduce_holy_napalm_desc:0 "A particular favorite tactic of General Earth, utilizing Holy Napalm to cleanse entire battlefields is a tried and true concept, that unfortunately we were unable to capitalize on when we first invaded the South-East. Now that we have a stronger production base, we can guarantee a constant supply of the holy weapon, and we shall see the peninsula burnt to ash around us!"
  MTS_spread_ascetic_inquisitor:0 "Spread the Ascetic Inquisitor Concept"
  MTS_spread_ascetic_inquisitor_desc:0 "Since we have a number of inquisitors that left with us, we should lean further upon their support. While Mage Luminous Blade already followed General Earth's teachings, and even helped establish them, there are other inquisitors who need further instruction. From there, we can spread the word throughout the nation, and streamline the Inquisitionis's function within and without in their hunt for heresy."
  MTS_wise_rejection:0 "Wise Rejection"
  MTS_wise_rejection_desc:0 "It appears that our instructions have finally started to bear fruit, as more ponies are growing disinterested in attending their heathen public schools - which were mostly destroyed anyway - and learning directly from the Adoratio. Already, literacy and understanding in basic theology is improving, and we can hope for properly well-educated citizens within a few years."
  MTS_require_charity:0 "Require Adoratio Charity" #Maybe change this to mandatory Adoratio time ministering to the soldiers
  MTS_require_charity_desc:0 "In order to properly evangelize the nation, the Solaris Adoratio requires a certain amount of money, as much as we are loath to admit it, which has been still been hard to come by since we arrived here. Ponies, in general, are not willing to part with their filthy lucre to give the Adoratio their proper dues. But who said that the request had to be optional?"
  MTS_lean_as_possible:0 "As Lean as Can be"
  MTS_lean_as_possible_desc:0 "By applying some of the concepts that we used in improving the industrial base of New Horseleans, we can further cut down cruft and inefficiencies in our supply lines. A few incentives here and there by properly... encouraging loyalty will go a long way to those who wish to keep their safety net within [MTS.GetNameDef]."
  MTS_unleash_empresss_wrath:0 "Unleash the Empress's Wrath"
  MTS_unleash_empresss_wrath_desc:0 "We have built [MTS.GetNameDef] into a single weapon with a sole purpose: eradicating the heresy and hedonism that resides on this peninsula. It is time that we remind them all why the Empress should never be crossed."
  
  ###Scorched Earth Post-War non-opulence###
  MTS_southeastern_triumph:0 "South-Eastern Triumph!"
  MTS_southeastern_triumph_desc:0 "With the final surrender of the remaining South-Eastern holdouts, we have claimed this peninsula for the Empress and restored a large section of the Empire that was lost for decades! May the souls of our fallen brethen be honored this day by the purging of all heresy from the South-East!"
  MTS_warriors_commitment:0 "Warriors Without Commitments"
  MTS_warriors_commitment_desc:0 "While our soldiers fought valiantly, it is undeniable that the ponies that we conscripted to sacrifice for the Empress have yet to closely embrace the teachings of General Earth. Many still hold to family, friends, or whatever few possessions they still have, and we must instill in them a higher calling."
  MTS_organized_expectations:0 "Organized Expectations"
  MTS_organized_expectations_desc:0 "We did haphazardly construct much of our military's regimen after we stablized New Horseleans, since the time we had to capitalize on [BAL.GetNameDef]'s weakness was limited. This has led to much confusion in our ranks on what constitutes adequately ascetic. It is time we set a baseline for them to achieve, before we go further."
  MTS_harsher_expectations:0 "Harsher Expectations"
  MTS_harsher_expectations_desc:0 "Since we did not have proper time to instruct all of the tenets of Militem Solar when we first conscripted many of our recruits, they have already backslidden into lax, hedonistic practices, such as food breaks! We must double-down on every aspect of being a soldier for the Empress, no matter unpopular."
  MTS_march_on_nothing:0 "Marching on Nothing"
  MTS_march_on_nothing_desc:0 "As we are all servants of the Empress, we must all learn how to be happy with nothing, if she so deems it. It is doubly important for a soldier of [MTS.GetNameDef] to be content no matter their situation, and therefore, we will start to drill them with the strictest of expectations for readiness at a moment's notice."
  MTS_lessons_of_jungle:0 "Lessons of the Jungle"
  MTS_lessons_of_jungle_desc:0 "Before we reconquered the South-East, tactics revolving around jungle warfare had been over two decades old, which left us woefully unprepared for anything that the communists or thestrals would throw at us. Thankfully, through grit and blood, we have adapted to some of the realities of this peninsula, and our doctrinces have benefited."
  MTS_luxurious_pain:0 "Pain is a Luxury"
  MTS_luxurious_pain_desc:0 "Most of our recruits from this subcontinent have pathetic tolerance for hardship. They don't realize that even the very pain they feel as they bleed, as they are sacrificed to the Empress, is a blessing, for that is the only way they truly know they are alive. Some further trials will instill the respect of agony that they need."
  MTS_discipline_succeeds:0 "Discipline will Succeed"
  MTS_discipline_succeeds_desc:0 "Although our troops could still stand to further sacrifice anything for the Empress, they have already been strictly drilled and instructed, so that they may one day fully embrace the loss that the Empress requires of us. Even under a hail of bullets, they will never break or fall back."
  MTS_theatre_of_learning:0 "Theater of Learning"
  MTS_theatre_of_learning_desc:0 "We have an ideal backyard for specializing our troops in various theaters of war. From the deep jungles to the soaring mountain ranges, our soldiers will know how to fight in every condition and carry the Empress's will to the ends of Equus!"
  MTS_zealotry_will_win:0 "Zealotry will Triumph"
  MTS_zealotry_will_win_desc:0 "Through effort and stringent punishment, our recruits are finally beginning to accept that they are nothing without the Empress. Every breath they take, every move they make, is only permitted by her will. If we march again against the enemies of Daybreaker, they will crush everycreature beneath her unwavering hoof!"
  MTS_empress_unachieved:0 "What the Empress Couldn't Achieve"
  MTS_empress_unachieved_desc:0 "It is undeniable that the South-East lay as a stain upon the Empress's record as one of the greatest indignity that was ever suffered by the Empire. For all her promises, she never sought to retake this land, which leaves General Earth with a great claim: accomplishing something that the Empress was incapable of doing herself. Truly, he is one of the greatest military leaders of our time!"
  MTS_remove_want:0 "Removing All Want"
  MTS_remove_want_desc:0 "Our civilian industry, while small, is still hungry for resources that are rightfully meant only for the Empress's finest. While some cry out for more aid to meet their demands, we shall answer with less, until everypony accepts that they only need the Empress's love."
  MTS_simplified_forges:0 "Simplified Forges"
  MTS_simplified_forges_desc:0 "Asceticism need not only be applied to the lives of our citizens in what they use themselves. Many nations have a pointless series of guidelines that they call a building code, which are nothing more than ways to prevent the most practical designs from being used to save on time wasted that could be spent producing for the Empress. Eliminating this will further augment our weapon yields with more forges."
  MTS_metals_galore:0 "Metals Galore"
  MTS_metals_galore_desc:0 "There is an uncountable amount of metal used in fruitless things like kitchen utensils or other luxuries as bedframes or similar items that many of our citizens have within the nation. However, those resources could be better used for the production of weapons, so that we do not have to scrape for every piece of iron that must be refined into steel. It's not like any of the beforementioned items are needed, anyway."
  MTS_ceaseless_lines:0 "Ceaseless Lines"
  MTS_ceaseless_lines_desc:0 "While the idea of sacrificing sleep to get something done is not new, it will be enforced to ensure that our production lines remain constantly at work. Ponies should consider it a blessing and a luxury if they are allowed to return home after a full, twenty-four hour day of labor, since the Empress herself never rests from protecting us. It is the least they can do to afford her the same service."
  MTS_want_not_waste_not:0 "Want not Waste not"
  MTS_want_not_waste_not_desc:0 "While we have sapped most of the small items from our citizens and used them for more practical purposes, there are still larger vehicles, machinery, or the like that are needless when ponies could simply rely on the Empress instead. However, these provide opportunity for us to further improve our independence from natural resources, as we slowly recycle anything and everything that we can."
  MTS_utilize_last_as_chattel:0 "Utilize the Last as Chattel"
  MTS_utilize_last_as_chattel_desc:0 "Many of the abominable thestrals were killed in our conquest of the South-East, yet not all of them were eliminated in fire. Our prisons are filled with the vile creatures, and while standard procedure would be to burn them all to cleanse the world of their taint, there is nothing preventing us from utilizing for more pragmatic purposes. Utilizing them could begin their repentance early."
  MTS_pure_government:0 "A Pure Government"
  MTS_pure_government_desc:0 "Until now, there were still a number of bureaucrats who worked in COBSOC running the nation. Not all of them were rabidly loyal to his ideals, and were happy to turn to the Empress, or at least feign love for her. However, their minds are still corrupt, and we must make every effort to fill our ranks with likeminded ponies from General Earth's general staff, lest the risk of a COBSOC coup ever become a reality."
  MTS_thankless_job:0 "A Thankless Job"
  MTS_thankless_job_desc:0 "Like all inquisitors, Mage Luminous Blade has tirelessly worked to keep the Empire and the Empress safe from any heretical threats; but on top of that, she has pledged herself to be Scorched Earth's lifelong guard, so that his mission will succeed. While all of the Empire's inquisitors deserve thanks, she above all, needs some acknowledgement of her sacrifice, especially in the wake of her war injuries."
  MTS_vexations:0 "Vexations"
  MTS_vexations_desc:0 "General Earth has been having... thoughts, as of late. He has been more reclusive and uppity, and there is little explanation why. Since his private meeting with Mage Blade, he has gone out of his way to avoid spending much time with her, or denying her his person to guard. Hopefully the general leaves his funk soon and can return to his normal performance."
  MTS_goddesss_light:0 "The Goddess's Light"
  MTS_goddesss_light_desc:0 "According to the general, his mind has yet to be put at ease with whatever is troubling it. Nopony has been told who, what, or why he had such a shift in personality, although a few wonder if he has been hexed by Discord or a vengeful thestral. It appears he will be seeking aid, as he has recently departed for the Cultus's primary church in New Baltimare, where he can hopefully get aid."
  MTS_quiet_contemplation:0 "Quiet Contemplation"
  MTS_quiet_contemplation_desc:0 "Since his last visit to the Adoratio's church, the General Earth has been far less jumpy, although whatever cure the priestesses have provided appear to have left him absentminded or foggy. Already, it is getting better, though, and he has promised after the next visit to the church, he will be right as rain. In a way, he seems almsot happier."
  MTS_show_meal:0 "Meal and a Show"
  MTS_show_meal_desc:0 "As there are a number prisoners and heretics who have yet to be properly judged and punished, General Earth - who has since been refreshed from the priestesses' assistance in his mysterious ailment - has decreed that the remainder will be brought forth to be punished. He has requested less security, however, stating that Mage Blade will keep him safe. He did appear rather flustered when he mentioned her."
  MTS_not_so_ascetic:0 "Not So Ascetic After All"
  MTS_not_so_ascetic_desc:0 "It cannot be confirmed, but rumors are circulating that there is something more to the relationship that General Earth and Mage Blade now share. Nopony dares ask either of them, however, so it will remain unclear unless one of them admits to their crime of abandonment of the Empress's calling. Whatever happened, they work better now than ever before."
  MTS_legitimize_militem:0 "Legitimizing [MTS.GetNameDef]"
  MTS_legitimize_militem_desc:0 "Many of our beliefs are in contention within the Empire itself, as the primary church in Sanctum Solar has not sanctioned most of what Scorched Earth holds to be true. However, we are not heretics, as we still hold to the same tenets as the rest of our brothers and sisters. Now that we have liberated the South-East for the Empress, Sunset Shimmer must surely welcome us back with open arms."
  MTS_to_be_saved:0 "To be Saved"
  MTS_to_be_saved_desc:0 "Everypony should be at least shown the way to salvation from their sins, even if most will never achieve because of their love of filthy lucre and other forms of hedonistic thought. Through some careful preaching from the Adoratio, we should be able to craft a slightly better image of us to the citizenry, and then lay the groundwork for future ascetic lifestyles."
  MTS_to_be_holier:0 "To be Holier"
  MTS_to_be_holier_desc:0 "It is a requirement of everypony to be as holy as the Empress herself, although all of us fail. However, it is clear that the general citizenry of the South-East are incapable of remaining loyal or loving to the Empress, which means that we will have to herd them until they are incinerated for their sins. The zealous among us will chafe to enact this policy, especially if we bring the light to further nations."
  MTS_loss_is_gain:0 "Loss is Gain"
  MTS_loss_is_gain_desc:0 "Ponies hold far too strong attachments to the things that they own. They have yet to realize that all goods are gifts from the Empress, and that because she provides them, she can just as easily take them away. Therefore, the ascetic lifestyle is ideal, as it sacrifices all possible to give back to her, and it maintains low needs, so that if things are lost, they cause little pain. If only more saw it that way."
  MTS_simple_means_easy:0 "Simple means Easy"
  MTS_simple_means_easy_desc:0 "As there is a truthfully self-inflicted housing crisis within the nation, we require a quick and easy method for us to rebuild and house those that were displaced. We do this not out of a kindness of our heart, for they should all be happy living where they are, but we do this out of necessity, lest more unrest begins to foment. One day, these will be torn down, just as easily as they are erected."
  MTS_singular_focus:0 "Singular Focus"
  MTS_singular_focus_desc:0 "As the brightest torch of the Empress, all of [MTS.GetNameDef] should be ready to fight and die for her and the Empire. Leave the worries of the afterlife, the economy, the farms, to other ponies, for we will be the sword that strikes directly into the heart of the Empress's enemies and our inquisitors the fire that melts away all heresy!"
  MTS_suffering_life_and_next:0 "Suffering in Both Lives"
  MTS_suffering_life_and_next_desc:0 "Although it is unlikely to truly reward them with eternal salvation, by promising our citizens that they will more likely be heard in prayer or given preference in death by denying their loves of money, things, spouse, or child, they should become willing to charge into the lines of enemy fire. Already, these messages have struck some chords, as our recruitment numbers are up. A new generation of servants await!"
  MTS_sanctification_mission:0 "Missions of Sanctification"
  MTS_sanctification_mission_desc:0 "By appealing to some of the aspects of the primary church in Sanctum Solar, we can encourage our followers and our priestesses to serve primarily in spreading the word of Daybreaker's salvation, and giving guidelines on sanctification. These may be different from Sanctum Solar, but they are still within orthodoxy, and should give us a legitimacy in the rest of the Empire."
  MTS_punishment_mission:0 "Missions of Punishment"
  MTS_punishment_mission_desc:0 "As the representative of Daybreaker, it is our mission to ensure that the heresy is kept minimal and heretics are punished wherever they are discovered. Appealing to the office of Lady Inquisitor in Sanctum Solar, we should encourage all of our loyal troops and Cultus members to further reverence, and legitimize our standing within the eyes of the Empire."
  MTS_minimalist_transcendence:0 "Minimalist Transcendence"
  MTS_minimalist_transcendence_desc:0 "Through extreme self-denial and constant meditation, some of our younger priestesses have offered to commune and learn from Daybreaker more so that we may stay on the right path. Even General Earth views them as a bit excessive, but we can't deny they've given us some insights into how we can utilize ponykind's innate magic further."
  MTS_minimalist_fury:0 "Minimalist Fury"
  MTS_minimalist_fury_desc:0 "As our inquisitors have striven harder, they have denied more of their own needs to ensure the body of the Empire continues to be preserved, nourished, and protected. Even now, their hunger and anger drives them to fight in new and creative ways against the heretics, which has led to an overall boon for our companies in battle."
  MTS_claiming_new_home:0 "Claiming Our New Home"
  MTS_claiming_new_home_desc:0 "With the fall of [BAL.GetNameDef] and the surrender of the other regions, we have asserted our dominance upon the entire peninsula! The prize that awaits us the port city of Baltimare, now such a large megalopolis that a distinct region has been designated for the entirety of COBSOC's government. We now have the capacity to flush out the last resistance here and set ourselves as the official rulers of the land."
  MTS_determining_finest:0 "Determining the Fittest"
  MTS_determining_finest_desc:0 "Among the prisoners, heretics, and abominations, there are many ponies who, while enemies of Daybreaker, could be used for something more than just an example what happens to those who turn their backs from her. We shall set criteria that must be met by the captives. If they are blessed enough by her, they will easily qualify and be rescued from the Holy Flame, only to serve their lives toiling for her."
  MTS_begin_purification:0 "Begin Reign of Purification"
  MTS_begin_purification_desc:0 "Hundreds of thousands of ponies have fled into the jungles and rurual villages, seeking safety from us, since they believe that we will harm them or their way of life. Ironically, it is this very action that have now doomed them. If they stayed in the cities, they would be spared, but now that they harbor with heretics, they will be given the same fate as we cleanse this land with the Holy Flame!"
  MTS_dying_breaths:0 "Use Their Dying Breaths"
  MTS_dying_breaths_desc:0 "Ponies are like resources: they do not last forever. While we still are able to bolster our workerforce through the useful prisoners which we hold, we should aim to rapidly grow our cities and towns to provide a base for crafting the Empress's weapons of war. Many of the captives will likely die in this effort, but when did that ever matter?"
  MTS_discard_waste:0 "Discard the Waste"
  MTS_discard_waste_desc:0 "Of the prisoners that were not deemed worthy of serving the Empress in labor, the rest will be used as either cannon fodder or as examples to those that are still free. Whether they be heretic, abomination, or enemy, they will all provide an identical message: the Empress will be obeyed, no matter the price."
  MTS_flatten_cities:0 "Flatten the Corrupt Cities"
  MTS_flatten_cities_desc:0 "As an ultimate insult to the Empress, the damned thestrals have had cities this entire time, deep in the jungle and near the base of the Scale Mountains! These must have been one of the ways that they have remained so populous and so much a thorn in the Empress's side as creatures of darkness. There is only recourse for their existence, and that is to end it. With fire."
  MTS_burn_jungles:0 "Burn the Jungle to Ash"
  MTS_burn_jungles_desc:0 "A large percentage of the thestral population and a number of communist cells reside in the deep thicket of the peninsula's jungle, which they believe will stymie us in our dedication to eradicate them. While it is a noble goal, they are sorely mistaken on the lengths we'll go to purify this peninsula. If we have to burn down every square inch to see heresy cleansed, so be it!"
  MTS_wide_applications:0 "Wide Applications"
  MTS_wide_applications_desc:0 "The principles that we exercised in sifting through the fit and unfit from ponies that we captured have proven largely successful. Not only have we had many examples to display to dissuade heresy, but we have also created an auxiliary workforce that can be utilized twenty-four-seven. Cementing this principles into law will greatly enhance any of our future conquests, and speed the integration of new lands in the process."
  MTS_holy_justice:0 "Holy Justice on a Grand Scale"
  MTS_holy_justice_desc:0 "As a tried and true method, the use of fire and napalm to cleanse lands of taint and heresy has been proven yet again as we've cleared the South-East of much of its corruption. Considering that General Earth is a proponent of just such policies, it should prove trivial to implement and standardize how future lands are cleaned for our use. It will involve flames. Lots of flames."
  MTS_solar_south_east:0 "A Solar South-East"
  MTS_solar_south_east_desc:0 "With the last of the cells of communists destroyed and the thestrals purified or captured, the South-East is finally within the domain of the Empress again. There will still be unrest, but now those loyal to us will begin the process of healing the nation, and preparing it for the inevitable return into the Empress's embrace directly. Until that day, may we celebrate our efforts together!"
  MTS_pure_peninsula:0 "A Pure Peninsula"
  MTS_pure_peninsula_desc:0 "For decades, the South-East has been a haven for scum, villains, and thestrals, but now that we have brought it back into the fold, we have established this subcontinent as a beacon of light and loyalty for the rest of Equus to see. Our citizens now serve without question, and every day, more flock to the Empress's name that they may be saved. We shall all stand in her might, and we shall walk into her embrace, as one!"
  MTS_return_journey:0 "The Return Journey"
  MTS_return_journey_desc:0 "With the South-East stabilized and an example for all within the Empire, it is time we petition that the Empress hear us, and welcome us back with open arms. General Earth is confident that he will be accepted, and it will only take a short letter for us to finally know of our fate."
  
  ###Scorched Earth SOL accepted###
  MTS_southeast_mandate:0 "Mandate of the South-East"
  MTS_southeast_mandate_desc:0 "The dispatch from [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] is clear: the Empress demands that we establish a more stable nation than one run on the blood, sweat, and tears of all of her followers. While it is disappointing that she has not Seen Scorched Earth's wisdom, we cannot disobey, as she is offering us an eventual path back to fellowship with the Empire."
  MTS_desire_crisis:0 "A Crisis of Desires"
  MTS_desire_crisis_desc:0 "While we have been in a constant state of war or war-readiness, our citizens were willing, to a point, to tolerate harsher living conditions. Now that it is clear that the Empress wants to usher in a wave of peace and prosperity, they have clamored to begin to refill their pantries and, a demand our current economy cannot meet. For the sake of [MTS.GetNameDef], it must be addressed."
  MTS_faith_crisis:0 "A Crisis of Faith"
  MTS_faith_crisis_desc:0 "Although the population has pledged themselves to serve the Empress, they are still in their infancy of their faith journey. Without a clear, stated reason why they must continue to supposedly suffer and starve compared to their brethren in [SLE.GetNameDef], they have begun to actively protest against the Cultus and Scorched Earth himself. This insult to the Empress cannot stand forever!"
  MTS_body_crisis:0 "A Crisis of Body"
  MTS_body_crisis_desc:0 "It was kept quiet while we were prepared for war, but it is now growing difficult to contain that disease is running rampant through much of the civilian population. Although they should be healthy, they are failing basic tests. A number of our medical staff have proposed solutions, but they all involve things which General Earth stands completely against. But what are we to do if we want to stave off collapse?"
  MTS_loosen_straps:0 "Loosen the Straps"
  MTS_loosen_straps_desc:0 "Adoratio Priestess Warm Night has approached us with some compromises that we can implement in order to ease the anger and struggling that many of our subjects experience. These may be antithetical to many of Scorched Earth's teachings and tenets, but with most of the population refusing to work without some form of relenting on our part, we have little choice but to comply."
  MTS_imperfect_union:0 "Imperfect Union"
  MTS_imperfect_union_desc:0 "The relaxed demeanor that General Earth has had for the number of months has quickly deteriorated as he has taken upon himself more of the administrative work required in these trying times for both us and our citizens. Clearly many things are stressing him, but Mage Blade has promised that he is doing well. Hopefully she can get through to him with time."
  MTS_reopen_SECDC:0 "Reopen the South-Eastern Center for Disease Control"
  MTS_reopen_SECDC_desc:0 "As the Great War raged on in Equus, Princess Celestia at the time established a small number of advanced medical centers for treating then-unseen injuries and diseases. The South-Eastern branch of the Center for Disease Control continued under COBSOC, but we shuttered it for costs and for the frivolous services it provided. However, with this blight of ill-health, it may be time to resurrect it."
  MTS_complete_demobilization:0 "Complete Demobilization"
  MTS_complete_demobilization_desc:0 "Both the calls from Warm Night and a few other priestesses and the demands of the ponies protesting their quality of life are too strong to ignore. The Empress mandated that we maintain a stable Ordo within the South-East, and if we push them too far, we could see a civil war break out. Therefore, we must meet their requests, even if it means we will no longer be prepared to fight in a war if need be."
  MTS_retain_preparedness:0 "Retain a Level of Preparedness"
  MTS_retain_preparedness_desc:0 "Although it is undeniable that the citizens want a complete return to pre-Imperial life, that is simply not possible. However, that does not mean we cannot compromise and establish a fairer, more balanced system, so that we can still maintain some level of readiness for further militarization, but also give the citizens some of their required luxuries back. Hopefully it will at least please some."
  MTS_seeking_sanctification:0 "Seeking Sanctification"
  MTS_seeking_sanctification_desc:0 "A dark cloud has figuratively settled over the General's head for the past few weeks, to the point that even Mage Blade has been hesitant to speak with him or guard him. It has not been a problem, as other soldiers can pick up the slack, but something must have happened between the two. Lately, he has spoken of seeking forgiveness, but it is not apparent if he refers to the Empress or somepony else."
  MTS_establish_reasonable_quotas:0 "Establish Resonable Quotas"
  MTS_establish_reasonable_quotas_desc:0 "With the SECDC already improving the health of all of our citizens, it will be no issue to retain an acceptable number of troops to be prepared in case the Empress calls us into war with the changeling threat or elsewhere against heretics. It will not be a popular move among the general population, but we have a great gift in the number that can serve, and it would be a sin to not make use of it."
  MTS_to_minimum_capacity:0 "Reduce to Minimum Capacity"
  MTS_to_minimum_capacity_desc:0 "To maintain security within our borders, we must have a certain level of ponies serving in our branch of the Militarium at any one time. On top of that, the Empress does require us to contribute in the case of a war with heretical nations. However, there is some leeway within, and to appease our restless populace, we will announce new quotas for recruitment that must be met, which please all parties involved."
  MTS_limit_excesses:0 "Limit Excesses"
  MTS_limit_excesses_desc:0 "Clearly the truly ascetic lifestyle is not fit for everypony, as is typified by the population of the South-East. Even those that at one point served readily have begun to backslide, and Scorched Earth has finally admitted that he might have been a bit too extreme too quickly. While we will still require of everypony to not be distracted from the Empress, a few luxuries will not hurt anypony."
  MTS_civilize_interior:0 "Civilize the Interior"
  MTS_civilize_interior_desc:0 "Even with the thestrals cleared from the jungles, the Neighua and other tribalistic groups have lived mostly without interference for close to half a century. As a first step toward bringing them into the fellowship of the Empress and entering the eleventh century, we should begin with connecting our nation's major cities together, as it will also allow for faster communication and supplies, if needed."
  MTS_better_and_worse:0 "For Better and For Worse"
  MTS_better_and_worse_desc:0 "Recently the General has appeared more at ease, although he still will not discuss what exactly has been eating away at his conscience these last few months. The occasional disappearance in the night has also been worrying, especially if it is for some secretic hedonistic activity. He has slipped away again, this time for far longer, and we can only hope that whatever he is doing, it's for the best for [MTS.GetNameDef]."
  MTS_form_southern_guard:0 "Form the Southern Guard"
  MTS_form_southern_guard_desc:0 "While we may never have a military as large now as the Empress herself, that does not mean that we will be useless. General Earth has had decades of experience, something that he will be sharing with a new wing of our Militarium branch focused primarily on heavy destruction and rapid response to incursion. These vanguards will have enough firepower to crush any foreign incursion rapidly!"
  MTS_peninsulas_flagship:0 "Flagship of the Peninsula"
  MTS_peninsulas_flagship_desc:0 "Since we first arrived here, we have relied on small ship tactics to take advantage of the coastal regions around the South-Eastern Peninsula and simply outnumber the enemy where possible. However, to integrate within the Empire's navy, Evening Tempest has helped design a battleship that will be on par with anything within the Empire. We will use it to crush our enemies from afar!"
  MTS_moderate_economy:0 "A Moderate Economy"
  MTS_moderate_economy_desc:0 "With our new laws in place, alleviating what the citizens claim are the worst of the oppressive economic institutions, we have created an amalgam of our own teachings and those of the mainline Adoratio. While this syncreticism is not popular among the loyalists of General Earth, all of us agree that it is required in order to please the Empress."
  MTS_ultimate_secret:0 "An Ultimate Secret"
  MTS_ultimate_secret_desc:0 "Lately, General Earth and Mage Blade have been seen together again, and apparently whatever that happened between them is resolved. Once again, the General has returned to a calmer state, and has actually apologized to a few of his aides that he treated harshely. What has exactly transpired in his life will forever remain a mystery."
  MTS_ultimate_truth:0 "An Ultimate Truth"
  MTS_ultimate_truth_desc:0 "Since the General has spoken with Mage Blade within the last few weeks, he has appeared calmer and less nerve-wracked. Some of our officers have grown quite curious what kind of hold she seems to have on him, since they have been spotted together, alone, many times and fueling rumors of an affair. Perhaps, though, it is best to leave it be. He will speak of it when he wants."
  MTS_oiled_machine:0 "A Well-oiled Machine"
  MTS_oiled_machine_desc:0 "Since the SECDC has been restored, the health of our population has been on the mend. Between stricter exercise regimens and different diets, the cases of malnourishment - the problem behind all their ailments - has drastically been reduced. Like a finely-tuned and oiled machine, those that still serve with us have a new energy to them that will make them willingly march into the pits of Tartarus itself!"
  MTS_overwhelming_production:0 "Production Overwhelming"
  MTS_overwhelming_production_desc:0 "As the South-East is a well of rich natural resources, as one of our greatest acts of sacrifice to the Empress, we should work at claiming more of it from the deposits we know and returning it to the Empress in the form of trade and weapons. Further extraction will also lead to increased steel yields within forges, that we may use in helping both the populace and the military."
  MTS_mine_mountains:0 "Mine the Mountains"
  MTS_mine_mountains_desc:0 "Recent surveys have suggested that most of the Scale Mountains are rich with crystals that can be used to power the matrices that are used in our magical energy weapons. From the samples taken, they appear to be of the highest caliber, useful for military and civilian use alike in complex machines, which makes them perfect for the Empress."
  MTS_masters_of_jungle:0 "Masters of the Jungle"
  MTS_masters_of_jungle_desc:0 "Through grit and determination, we have become the masters of the jungle, supplanting the cursed bats and backwards Neighua as ponies well-adapted to the heat, humidity, and pests that infest the canopies. Our soldiers will navigate any maze of flora and come out the other side unscathed, while using it as a trap for any foes that dare to charge into our lands in an attempt to defeat the Empress!"
  MTS_normalcy_returned:0 "Return to Normalcy"
  MTS_normalcy_returned_desc:0 "At last, [MTS.GetNameDef] has become the exemplar Solarist nation on Equus! Because of the labor that Scorched Earth has given us for all these years, we have cleansed the peninsula and ensured a populace loyal and loving to the Empress.\n\nSoon, the book of history on [MTS.GetNameDef] will close. §YForever.§!"
  
  ###Scorched Earth SOL rejected###
  MTS_deitys_condemnation:0 "A Deity's Condemnation"
  MTS_deitys_condemnation_desc:0 "It seems completely unbelievable! The Empress has rejected us and claimed that we are a heretical, false Ordo? It's an impossible claim, but Scorched Earth has gotten the missive himself from [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], and there is no mistaking the stamp. We are now alone against an angry goddess..."
  MTS_rejections_sting:0 "The Sting of Rejection"
  MTS_rejections_sting_desc:0 "Normally a single pony is declared a heretic when condemned by the Inquisitionis. Rarely, it could be an entire village or town, but so far it has been clearly indicated that EVERYPONY within [MTS.GetNameDef] have been designated heretics. This has hit many of our inquisitors particularly hard, and we can only hope they recover soon."
  MTS_stunning_defeat:0 "A Stunning Defeat"
  MTS_stunning_defeat_desc:0 "Although it is the knowledge of every officer they cannot claim victory every time, Scorched Earth was extremely confident that the Empress would accept us back into her arms. Since the word of the Empress returned to him, he has remained locked in his quarters, and has seen few ponies. We have been left rudderless in the roughest storm of our lives, and hopefully we do not suffer for it."
  MTS_empty_faith:0 "Empty Faith"
  MTS_empty_faith_desc:0 "The Solaris Adoratio has always been the most united of the branches of the Solaris Cultus, yet even the priestesses that have come with us have not been spared rebuke and punishment. At this time, they are carrying out their duties for the populace, but many have entered a state of despair. What is their meaning if they cannot have fellowship with the Empress?"
  MTS_new_revelation:0 "New Revelation"
  MTS_new_revelation_desc:0 "At last, General Earth has emerged from his quarters with a new revelation. We have not been rejected by the Empress, we have been rejected by those who command [SLE.GetNameDef]! The hedonism that he grew wary of in the Empire has clearly spread and usurped all power the Empress has! We must rescue her if we are to ever bring stability back to Equus!"
  MTS_purity_of_will:0 "Purity of Will"
  MTS_purity_of_will_desc:0 "If we are to succeed in our quest, then all of the soldiers within [MTS.GetNameDef] must be of one mind and one will, never wavering from the objective to liberate the Empress from the corrupted ponies that have wrested control of the Empire from her. We are the only thing that stands between complete chaos and hedonism and order and salvation. We cannot fail!"
  MTS_purity_of_mind:0 "Purity of Mind"
  MTS_purity_of_mind_desc:0 "As the sole pony who will take on the brunt of the burden to liberate the Empress, Scorched Earth must ensure that he is completely focused and mentally clear, capable of sound judgement and wise decision-making at a moment's notice. For that purpose, he shall train more than ever before to be a razor-sharp knife that will gut the corruption of the Empire."
  MTS_purity_of_body:0 "Purity of Body"
  MTS_purity_of_body_desc:0 "A country is like a giant organism, and just like the ponies that make up our fighting arms must be pure, so much the rest of the civilian body, as they must be ready to sacrifice everything to see our mission accomplished. Preparing them for the war to end all wars will be the hardest thing we have ever done."
  MTS_needless_soldiers:0 "Needless Soldiers"
  MTS_needless_soldiers_desc:0 "Every soldier will be from the moment of their induction into the Militarium taught the very highest concepts of a warrior's ascetic lifestyle. If they do not conform they will be killed. When our military is nothing but soldiers who march for not even the food provided, then we will return the Empress to her power, as we drown our enemies in faithful blood."
  MTS_officers_of_less:0 "Officers of Less"
  MTS_officers_of_less_desc:0 "A military is a hungry animal, and our officers have been doing wonders since we came here to keep the entire operation running as smoothly as possible. But to ensure we have enough for the influx of ponies that will be fighting under us, we must tighten the belt, and our commanders will simply have to make do with what they have."
  MTS_war_of_soul:0 "The War of the Soul"
  MTS_war_of_soul_desc:0 "As we are all treading into uncharted territory, it is a terrifying thing to contemplate what will happen to the Empire once we achieve our goals. Nopony has been affected more by this than General Earth, who is clearly battling within on what actions he should take against his former brothers and sisters. Unfortunately, it is only a decision he can make."
  MTS_iron_sharpens_iron:0 "Iron Sharpens Iron"
  MTS_iron_sharpens_iron_desc:0 "It is not only General Earth who has taken it upon themselves to be at the very peak of their physical and mental prowess. Luminous Blade has also pledged to train as much as he, and both of them have recently started to train together, which has already seen improved results beyond what either could do by themselves."
  MTS_sacrifice_basics:0 "Sacrifice the Basics"
  MTS_sacrifice_basics_desc:0 "If we are to reach the lofty goal that we have set for ourselves, then every citizen must learn to live with far less than they already have. Every factory still dedicated to meeting their inane demands will be retooled for churning out guns and ammunition, and will likely never be returned to a pre-war state. They should get used to hearing "no" a lot more often."
  MTS_meals_are_hedonistic:0 "Meals are Hedonistic"
  MTS_meals_are_hedonistic_desc:0 "Providing sustenance for our soldiers is top priority, even if it means requiring our civilians to go without food or water. They should take this as an opportunity to rely solely on the Empress's strength and power to remain filled, instead of the sin of resting assured on a body's own vitality."
  MTS_simple_extraction:0 "Simple Extraction"
  MTS_simple_extraction_desc:0 "Through greatly simplifying the kits of our soldiers, we can easily standardize and streamline every unit's logistics and maintain a rapid, responsive military. Although they might have to struggle a bit more to achieve the same tasks, our soldiers will no doubt cause every corrupt pony within the Empire to bleed dry."
  MTS_blood_for_blood:0 "Blood for Blood"
  MTS_blood_for_blood_desc:0 "As the Empire is significantly larger than us and has had several large-scale battles to test their tactics on, we will be at a disadvantage if we attack immediately upon declaring war. Instead, we will make them come to us, which will provide us with a home turf advantage, especially as every soldier will fight to their last breath instead of be captured."
  MTS_one_unit:0 "As One Unit"
  MTS_one_unit_desc:0 "The consistent time that they have spent together have left General Earth and Mage Blade as a well-functioning unit, to the point that they can predict some of their suggestions or ideas. There appears to be more than just that spark, but they have become a truly perfect duo, capable of leading the military into the heart of the Empire without hesitation or misstep."
  MTS_no_production_missed:0 "No Production Missed"
  MTS_no_production_missed_desc:0 "In lieu of the number of factories that we need, we shall isntead require of every worker in the Empire to labor twice as hard to meet our end goals of overwhelming production. The factories will no longer close, and everypony shall work at least sixteen hour days before permission to rest for a short while. Our armories shall fill with weapons meant for liberation!"
  MTS_eliminate_living_standards:0 "Eliminate Living Standards"
  MTS_eliminate_living_standards_desc:0 "Ponies can have no quarter to complain about living standards if we remove all concept from society of such a thing. Soon, to live will simply be enough, that then ponies may serve the Empress with their waking breaths, and anypony caught mentioning a time before with even basic needs being met will be silenced. Permanently."
  MTS_pain_of_existence:0 "Pain of Existence"
  MTS_pain_of_existence_desc:0 "To properly appreciate the pain that everypony should feel at the loss of the Empress's command of the Empire, we will require our soldiers to sacrifice everything, body, soul, and mind. When they are driven into such a fervor that they will wish to fight through all of Sanctum Solar itself, we know that we will have done enough, as we loose them upon the heretics in the north."
  MTS_prepare_against_inevitable:0 "Prepare against the Inevitable"
  MTS_prepare_against_inevitable_desc:0 "It is more than likely that the corrupt souls within the Empire will attempt to snuff our light out before we finalize our military preparations. In case of this, we shall construct a mighty series of fortifications across the northern stretches of [MTS.GetNameDef], as a guard against attack and provide us the time we need."
  MTS_fruitless_invasions:0 "Fruitless Invasions"
  MTS_fruitless_invasions_desc:0 "The enemy may try to take our lands, but we will give them no satisfaction in doing so. With so little tying them down, our soldiers and citizens can freely move further into the peninsula, whilst leaving nothing behind. Let our foes starve as they attempt to survive in the jungles of this hellish peninsula!"
  MTS_life_taxes:0 "Life Taxes"
  MTS_life_taxes_desc:0 "While we may deride the idea of monetary funds, they are still required at this time to accomplish many feats. To further fund our military machine, we will begin taxing ponies simply for being alive. After all, their life is a blessing from the Empress, and they would dare not deny her the money she's for that, would they?"
  MTS_shared_abodes:0 "Shared Abodes"
  MTS_shared_abodes_desc:0 "A number of ponies within the South-East have grown accustomed to living independently, without sharing rooms with families or even strangers. If we are to reach our total capacity, we weill need to eliminate this concept, as we jam more ponies into smaller spaces to erect great war forges for the Empress."
  MTS_nothing_but_empress:0 "Nothing but the Empress"
  MTS_nothing_but_empress_desc:0 "Our entire society is going through a radical shift. Before, we have still allowed at least some small pieces of respite, whether meeting with family, a few hours of meditation, or something else, but with our situation dire, we will require that everypony, no matter how young or old, to toil and give up possesions for the Empress. It is the only way we shall survive."
  MTS_salvation_to_thestrals:0 "Salvation to the Thestrals"
  MTS_salvation_to_thestrals_desc:0 "Although the damnable thestrals will never truly know the joy of living in the blessings of the Empress, they can at least bgin to repent of their sins of existence by being used by us. There are thousands of their kind living within our prisons, waiting for a proper execution, and now they shall be given it, through dying on the battlefield."
  MTS_united_in_devotion:0 "Unified in Devotion"
  MTS_united_in_devotion_desc:0 "As they are a perfect team, General Earth and Mage Blade have been sharing more and more of their knowledge with each other, and with the Militarium at large. It is no wonder that General Earth has finally decided that, to fill gaps at the highest eschelons, that she will be given a true role by his side, as the other leading general of [MTS.GetNameDef], so that she may lead as effectively as he."
  MTS_way_of_squire:0 "Way of the Squire"
  MTS_way_of_squire_desc:0 "As a final blessing to our soldiers, we shall be providing them with many new and useful weapons for their forray into the Empire. These parting gifts shall be a reminder to them of their duty, just as a squire would be required to serve his or her lord with absolute faith and humility. With these, our soldiers shall achieve complete victory!"
  MTS_live_to_die:0 "To Live is to Die"
  MTS_live_to_die_desc:0 "It is still a mystery to some how so many are willing to die in battle against our foes, whether they win or not. However, as the scriptures of the Adoratio say, to live is to die for her will, and to die for her is to gain salvation. We shall ensure that everypony knows this, that they will see paradise if they perish in combat to her."
  MTS_cost_of_luxury:0 "Cost of Luxury"
  MTS_cost_of_luxury_desc:0 "The one thing that the hedonism of COBSOC allowed was many redundant factories and material to be acquired on short notice through the ruins of the many, pointless living quartesr or factories that they once utilized. These shall feed our industrial efforts for years to come."
  MTS_rescue_empress:0 "Rescue the Empress!"
  MTS_rescue_empress_desc:0 "The final judgement of the corrupt ponies who now control the Empire has come. We shall strike at their very throat so that the Empress may be freed from her prison and lead ponies again into greatness and peace!"
  MTS_empire_freed:0 "An Empire Freed"
  MTS_empire_freed_desc:0 "Against all odds, we have beaten back the corrupt forces that have usurped the Empress's throne! Our faith has given us the strength we need to overcome all evil, and as such, we shall establish a new Empire that will stretch from coast to coast!"
  MTS_preaching_new_gospel:0 "Preaching a New Gospel"
  MTS_preaching_new_gospel_desc:0 "The vile twisting of the Adoratio in Sanctum Solar have no doubt played a role in the corruption that infested the Empire and its territories. Thankfully, the ponies of the land are like sponges and will soak up any teaching of the Empress, especially if it is the truth. Therefore, we will dispatch our pure priestesses to proclaim the good, ascetic news of salvation to the masses."
  MTS_restoring_order:0 "Restoring Order"
  MTS_restoring_order_desc:0 "For the time being, General Earth will remain in control of the Empire, while he sifts through the lies and deceptions that plague the Imperial Palace, until every single pony responsible for the heinous actions that led to our liberation has answered for their crimes, and stability within the Empire is returned."
  MTS_breaking_nobles_backs:0 "Breaking the Nobles' Backs"
  MTS_breaking_nobles_backs_desc:0 "With our command of the Empire, we now finally have an opportunity to eliminate the one thing that has been a thorn in the Cultus and Militarium's sides since their inception: the damned nobility and their impressive ability to avoid any and all work for the Empress. Their fortunes will be destroyed, and then so will they."
  MTS_appointing_new_clergy:0 "Appointing a New Clergy"
  MTS_appointing_new_clergy_desc:0 "It is clear that the very heart of the Adoratio that resides within the Empire's territory has been blackened by sin and theological darkness. They preach more about how the Empress will bless everypony who follows than how to be one who blesses, and they give wrong information at that! Redeeming the office of High Mage is the first of the solutions that will be required."
  MTS_threat_quarantined:0 "A Threat Quarantined"
  MTS_threat_quarantined_desc:0 "Normally, whoever is the Lady Inquisitor provides a balance on some of the teachings of the Adoratio that they do not become heretical and lead ponies astray; however, the current Lady Inquisitor, Quasar Pulse, is an unstable sycophant who believes that she will please the Empress in everything. This, at least, allows us to mold her back into a model pony to help us."
  MTS_bitter_honesty:0 "Bitter Honesty"
  MTS_bitter_honesty_desc:0 "Since we have taken the Empire, [SLE.GetLeader] has been placed under house arrest, so that Scorched Earth may question [SLE.GetLeader.GetHerHim] when the time is right. With the majority of tasks completed in stabilizing the Empire, that time has now come. All shall be revealed soon enough."
  MTS_purifying_sanctum:0 "Purifying the Sanctum"
  MTS_purifying_sanctum_desc:0 "For hundreds of years, Sanctum Solar, or as it was once called, Canterlot, has been the seat of government and through that, has grown wealthy and fat. Despite the Empress's cleansing when she fended off the communists of Stalliongrad, it was rebuilt with even more splendor, encouraging further hedonism. We shall remedy that this day with the Holy Flame."
  MTS_cleansing_cities:0 "Cleansing the Cities"
  MTS_cleansing_cities_desc:0 "A small but yet influential group of ponies have remained rich and spoiled in the Empire, as they either had ties with the Palace or they helped to control the public companies that forged the weapons and armor of the Empire. However, their status will not deter us. Some of their filthy hooves were the cause of this coup against the Empress, and it shall not go unpunished."
  MTS_integration_perfected:0 "Integration, Perfected"
  MTS_integration_perfected_desc:0 "We are all the same pony, following the Empress through thick and thin and trusting in her power to save us in our deaths. We must preach this far and wide within in the Empire, so that citizens finally agree to our yoke so that we may sanctify them further."
  MTS_new_dynasty:0 "A New Dynasty"
  MTS_new_dynasty_desc:0 "The revelations of [SLE.GetLeader] have been nothing short of shocking. Even the General has been silent to ponder exactly what was told to him. However, he has stated that a new procolamation will come today. Whatever it is, it will surely rock the Empire as well."
  MTS_occupation_perfected:0 "Occupation, Perfected"
  MTS_occupation_perfected_desc:0 "With most occupying forces, there is little similarity between the ponies that have conquered and the ponies that have been conquered. This is not the case with us, as our soldiers and those we occupy share many of the same beliefs, and already have a common bond. If we highlight this further, it should reduce the hatred that our warriors experience, and lessen subversive activity."
  MTS_torch_continent:0 "A Torch to the Continent"
  MTS_torch_continent_desc:0 "Like the South-Eastern Peninsula before, the continent of Equus is still a haven of hedonism and sin. With the entire Empire now at our disposal, it will be foals play to achieve the Empress's initial vision of uniting the former lands of Equestria together. General Earth will lead us to salvation, so that we may burn the corruption that has festered for decades to ash!"
  
  ###Scorched Earth Opulence War###
  MTS_last_torch:0 "The Last Torch"
  MTS_last_torch_desc:0 "The impossible has happened. The God-Empress, who was the salvior of all ponykind, has been overthrown. The corruption that was in the fringes of the Empire has boiled over and usurped control! There is nothing left that we can do to save the Empress, but we can carry on the Holy Flame and burn the heretics who ousted to ash!"
  MTS_living_sacrifices:0 "Living Sacrifices"
  MTS_living_sacrifices_desc:0 "Every follower of the Empress must be prepared to fight with their lives to keep the Holy Flame burning. The wretched scum that we have inherited from [BAL.GetNameDef] are nothing but cowards, and while they did serve in the war to retake the Peninsula, they have clamored for demobilization. They shall instead be met with further recruitment, more taxing regimen, and a constant message: their lives are forfeit to serve the Empress."
  MTS_warriors_knowledge:0 "Warriors' Knowledge"
  MTS_warriors_knowledge_desc:0 "A soldier must not only be somepony who can wield a gun, but they must also understand the tactics of war itself. Most of our recruits have only received teaching in the former, and little in the latter. Thankfully, General Earth and his inner circle are a wealth of tactical information, with which we can further the development of our army and retake the Empire."
  MTS_promote_minimal_lifestyle:0 "Require the Minimalist Lifestyle"
  MTS_promote_minimal_lifestyle_desc:0 "Every stallion and every mare that works within our military, let alone the rest of society, will need to have complete devotion with absolutely no distractions from the coming liberation war, nor from worshiping the Empress in all their actions. Therefore, if they wish to live, they will begin living on the barest of necessities immediately, lest their sin prevent them from victory."
  MTS_smarter_asceticism:0 "Smarter Asceticism"
  MTS_smarter_asceticism_desc:0 "While science has in general only led to increased luxuries and further descent into barbaric hedonism, the method of research and development itself is not wrong. Although there are many tools that can corrupt it, utilizing it to further enhance our own weaponry will provide us with an easier time in rescuing everypony on Equus, so long as heresy can be avoided."
  MTS_useless_sight:0 "Useless Sight"
  MTS_useless_sight_desc:0 "The cursed thestrals, while embodiments of evil, are uniquely qualified for life in the Peninsula. Although it is a begrudging admission, if we were to research how exactly they were able to ambush so many of our troops at night, we could possibly provide our soldiers with an edge during nighttime combat with the help of a bit of magic."
  MTS_simple_weapons:0 "Simple Weapons for Simple Warriors"
  MTS_simple_weapons_desc:0 "There is a time and place for advancement, but now is not that time. Instead of looking into new and unseen weapons that could take years to properly pay off, it is better if we improve and simplify our production and weapon base, so that we can further supply our soldiers, which are ever expanding, with the best weaponry possible. It is the only way to save the Empire."
  MTS_glass_cannons:0 "Glass Cannons"
  MTS_glass_cannons_desc:0 "Initial successes in innovating our designs have led to a few different possibilities. Most of our tank prototypes have been specialized for some task or another, but to see which is truly the best, it will require a head-to-head demonstration of them all. Most promising are anything with large guns, as what point is armor if you destroy the target before they can fire?"
  MTS_one_with_jungle:0 "One with the Jungle"
  MTS_one_with_jungle_desc:0 "To further our magical enhancements, we have taken the remaining thestral prisoners which we have and begun to properly experiment on them. While initial tests regarding eyesight could have been better, to learn how exactly they thrive in the jungle itself will be a boon to our forces. Sometimes, using the sinner can lead to something righteous after all."
  MTS_worthless_compared_to_eternity:0 "Worthless compared to Eternity"
  MTS_worthless_compared_to_eternity_desc:0 "We must be clear with our soldiers: nothing that they do, outside of serving the Empress, will ever save them from their sins. But that does not mean they are without hope. As we continue to drill into them the ideals of Daybreaker, we shall ensure they understsand that their deaths in battle will give them instant sanctification, further motivating them to charge the enemy in sacrifice."
  MTS_defender_of_solarism:0 "Defender of Solarism"
  MTS_defender_of_solarism_desc:0 "As the last light of the Empress on this planet, Scorched Earth has become the shield that any who are oppressed by the sinners and heretics of this world. The warm sun of the Empress shines upon him, providing him strength to carry out her last wishes and restore the Empire to its glory. May his aim be true, as he stabs into the heart of the heretics!"
  MTS_immaterial_possessions:0 "Immaterial Possessions"
  MTS_immaterial_possessions_desc:0 "Many ponies think that because we are taking away their earthly pleasures, that they will suffer for all of eternity. While some of them no doubt will, they must be made to understand that, while it is painful, their sacrifice will provide a greater benefit once they pass on, so long as they trust in the Empress. This should be more than reassuring enough for anypony."
  MTS_sacrifice_of_things:0 "Sacrifices of Things"
  MTS_sacrifice_of_things_desc:0 "Ideally, as we bring about the perfect world under Daybreaker's vision, we must realize that possessions of any sort are strictly distractions from the worship of the Empress. While this does not disallow tools or other useful items, they must be seen as a means to an end, not an end of themselves. Further restricting civilian access to supplies will only reinforce this idea, for their benefit."
  MTS_sacrifice_of_time:0 "Sacrifices of Time"
  MTS_sacrifice_of_time_desc:0 "There is no concept of free time in an ideal world. Anypony who believes that their will is bound to anything but the Empress's is only deluding themselves, and instead should be instructed on the ways with which they could serve her better. By busying them further, we should soon see returns on military production."
  MTS_nopony_owns_anything:0 "Nopony will own Anything"
  MTS_nopony_owns_anything_desc:0 "To further the requirements that ponies already have for living standards, they will be forced to give up even their privately owned utensils, sheeting, anything. If it was something that was purchased, it is now the Empress's, to be used as we see fit. This will not normally change anything, but items with useful materials will made ours completely, so that they can be utilized for better purposes."
  MTS_expand_worker_grottos:0 "Expand Worker Grottos"
  MTS_expand_worker_grottos_desc:0 "When we retook the South-East, many of the buildings that once housed the workers of COBSOC were destroyed, and many ponies have been living on the streets since then. While this should have humbled them, the cry for housing has been deafening, and we shall meet their demand. They might have been crammed in with three to a room, but now it shall be ten! The only practical solution that will solve our issues."
  MTS_no_more_hedonism:0 "No More Hedonism"
  MTS_no_more_hedonism_desc:0 "Although it was sparse, COBSOC did provide its citizens with avenues of state-doctored entertainment, all of which were lies spewed about the Empress. However, the mindless masses found these enjoyable, and as a way to combat the practices, the media shall not only be silenced, but removed entirely. It is a waste of time to read a comic or watch a movie, when it could be spent serving the Empress, anyway."
  MTS_defensible_churches:0 "Defensible Churches"
  MTS_defensible_churches_desc:0 "As the Adoratio spreads across the Peninsula, many churches will need to be constructed in order to properly serve the flocks of faithful. However, this also provides ample opportunity to provide bastions of Solarism, like this nation is, by making each church a fortress to itself in case of war. Even previously constructed churches will be brought to these standards, regardless of any tension it may cause."
  MTS_emplacements_of_fire:0 "Emplacements of Fire"
  MTS_emplacements_of_fire_desc:0 "With the first fortress churches constructed, we must build a ring of defense networks in their cities to prevent any and all invaders from utilizing air superiority or long ranged attacks to flush out the brave defenders. Entire batteries will be built so that the hail of lead from them will be so intense, that nothing will be able to get through!"
  MTS_medicine_is_luxury:0 "Medicine is a Luxury"
  MTS_medicine_is_luxury_desc:0 "In most nations, healthcare is seen as a basic right that creatures are entitled to merely for existing, but that is not only an expensive proposition, but a pointless one as well. What have the general citizenry ever done to deserve proper treatment? They only drain the system that should be used to serve those who fight for Order, which is exactly what we will now do."
  MTS_liberate_empire:0 "A Liberation of an Empire"
  MTS_liberate_empire_desc:0 "With our iron-forged society and soldiery, we stand at the brink of achieving our goals of liberating the Empire and restoring the Empress's fire to the world. In preparation, we must encourage the last steps in our plans to be done quickly, lest we lose the element of surprise and justice that will be required to defeat the heretics that have overtaken the Empire."
  MTS_sole_successor:0 "The Sole Successor"
  MTS_sole_successor_desc:0 "There may be others who try to claim the throne of the Empress for themselves, declaring that they are the true successor to the Empress's power, but they are nothing more than heretics or heathens. As we are the only ones with a true, uncorrupted priestesshood, and we have avoided the taint in the Empire itself, it is only natural that we are the only ones that can claim that right, and we must remind everypony of that."
  MTS_holy_among_heathens:0 "Holy Among Heathens"
  MTS_holy_among_heathens_desc:0 "As we are the sole light of the Empress left, we must be paragons of her light, might, and power. However, to achieve this, we must first completely rethink how we approach the role of the Inquisitionis. While it is perfectly reasonable to continue hunting heresy, they must also be beacons of the Empress to inspire everypony to fight for her, even if it means ignoring heresy, for the moment."
  MTS_grand_inquisition:0 "A Grand Inquisition"
  MTS_grand_inquisition_desc:0 "In lieu of consistent detection and destruction of heresy, we shall hold one, immense purge throughout [MTS.GetNameDef], so that we can bring it to almost nonexistent levels. Even within our own ranks, there is risk of compromise, which we must snuff out before it becomes a weakness that will prevent us from retaking the Empire for the Empress. We shall remain pure, or die trying!"
  MTS_unholy_texts:0 "Unholy Texts"
  MTS_unholy_texts_desc:0 "It has become clearer and clearer that the corruption that manifested itself within the Empire was not only due to heresy and lax teachers, but also because the texts that guide us have, at some point or another, become megaphones for sin and hedonism as well! In order to have a spotless Adoratio, we must completely unshackle ourselves from the past, and in so doing, ensure the Empress's will is carried out in its fullest."
  MTS_ascetic_torture:0 "Ascetic Torture"
  MTS_ascetic_torture_desc:0 "It is inconceiveable that some ponies believe that we must take easier measures on gaining information from heretics. Reports of what interrogations are like within [CER.GetNameDef] or [CLD.GetNameDef] are simply appalling, as they treat their prisoners with respect and dignity. If somepony has been accused as a heretic, there is no reason to be kind, for they will only be helpful when they are truly dead, which we will always hasten along."
  MTS_supportive_priesthood:0 "A Supportive Priestesshood"
  MTS_supportive_priesthood_desc:0 "The Adoratio has always been in the back seat of providing services to the faithful. Providing spiritual guidance, medical services to grievously injured, or other tasks have been their mode of operation for decades, and we see little reason for us to change the status quo, when they could only manage to improve our armies further from the rear."
  MTS_militant_priesthood:0 "A Militant Priestesshood"
  MTS_militant_priesthood_desc:0 "While the Adoratio has been used for decades to provide support and services to the faithful, that does not mean that they are only required to fill that role for the rest of time. There are many talented mages who otherwise see very little frontline service, and are quite capable of combat with the best of our soldiers. What reason is there to prevent them from joining, especially if it will aid our war against heresy?"
  MTS_new_cultus:0 "A New Solaris Cultus"
  MTS_new_cultus_desc:0 "With our new hoofhold in theology established, we can finally break free from the corrupt and vile Cultus that exists within the Empire's territory. No more will we pay homage to them, for they have forsaken their vows and will thusly only be treated as heretics. We are the Cultus now, and nothing will change that!"
  MTS_chastisement_of_fire:0 "Chastisement of Fire"
  MTS_chastisement_of_fire_desc:0 "These lands that we have taken are filled with nothing but heresy, rebellion, and hedonism. Millions of ponies believe that they are safe from any and all judgement, since they are not directly near any of the major cities. However, we have a number of captives from across the country, which we will use as a demonstration. They will fall in line, or they will burn in Tartarus forever!"
  MTS_string_up_separatists:0 "String up the Separatists"
  MTS_string_up_separatists_desc:0 "It is only fitting that the first to leave the Empire will be the first to perish by the Empire's hooves. The party members of COBSOC and their ilk will suffer for their transgressions against the Empress, beginning with those who were closest to Cobalt Hoof. Their dead bodies will serve as reminders that the Empress will always have her vengeance, and that nopony will be forgiven for their sins."
  MTS_all_martial_law:0 "Military Laws for All"
  MTS_all_martial_law_desc:0 "Having a distinction between civilian and martial laws is tedious and unneeded, since many of the judgements are the same for similar infractions. Eliminating all civilian laws will allow military tribunals speedier ability to punish lawbreakers, and also to further streamline what does and does not count as a crime. It will surely cut down on paperwork, if nothing else."
  MTS_deprive_nights_strength:0 "Deprive the Night of Its Strength"
  MTS_deprive_nights_strength_desc:0 "As there is a sizable population of thestrals that live in the Peninsula, we cannot possibly expect to completely and totally monitor them while they are able to continue their nocturnal heresies without retribution. Requiring that all of them live like the faithful, with waking hours between sunrise and sunset, will allow for easy control, and, hopefully simpler arrests for crimes they will no doubt commit."
  MTS_deface_state:0 "Deface the State"
  MTS_deface_state_desc:0 "In COBSOC, the face of the Party was the face of the state. In fact, they were one and the same. To provide a proper punishment for all of those left alive, we must humiliate the idea of a pony other than the Empress deserving of such devotion. We shall begin with Cobalt Hoof himself, and then move backwards until even all of MARESOC is mocked."
  MTS_blame_bats:0 "Blame the Bats"
  MTS_blame_bats_desc:0 "Although they are not some of the Empress's sheep, there are many within [MTS.GetNameDef] who despise the thestrals just as much as we do, if not more. It will be simple enough to blame them for any and all woes that have occurred since we have taken the Peninsula, so that we may kill two birds with one stone. There shall be less anger at us, and there shall be less thestrals for us to worry about, after a couple of good witch hunts."
  MTS_utilize_prisoners:0 "Utilize Prisoner Workforces"
  MTS_utilize_prisoners_desc:0 "Along with the captured from COBSOC, there are thousands upon thousands of prisoners that are already rotting in the prisons that they constructed. Although some of these ponies may see us as saviors, they will soon find that we are just as harsh a taskmaster, if not harsher, than COBSOC ever was. Together, they will expend the rest of their lives toiling for us and furthering the Empress's plans."

  MTS_night_of_thousand_cuts_desc:0 "The stage has been set for a proper culling of the thestrals. For too long, they have been thorns in the Empress's side and have continued to resist despite all our efforts to quash them and use them for her benefit. Our propaganda blaming thestrals for ponies' plights have paid off, and it will take only a spark to ignite the fire that will finally consume these creatures of darkness. All we need is a good ignitor."
  MTS_slimmed_population:0 "Slimmed Populations"
  MTS_slimmed_population_desc:0 "Across the Peninsula, there are many ponies who are not worth the effort to bring with us as we move forwad to victory. These shall simply be culled, so that we can make our moves complete in reclaiming this land for the Empress, and in so doing, lessen the burden on us and others, so that more focus can be placed on the Empress herself. After all, she is the giver of all life, and she can take it away just as easily."
  MTS_old_empress:0 "To an Old Empress"
  MTS_old_empress_desc:0 "No matter how dark it may get, we shall never renounce our love of Daybreaker nor our devotion to her. The Empire might have fallen, Daybreaker's physical body might have been destroyed, but we shall not stop, nor rest, until every inch of the Empire has been reclaimed, and every heretic infesting it is thrown into the Holy Flame, where their deeds shall be judged and their sins purified. For we are the true Empire, and nothing shall stop us!"

  MTS_renounce_sun_overlordship_desc:0 "While we have kept our ruse of loyalty, it is time we finally reveal our true colors. From this moment forth, we shall be directly opposed to those within [SLE.GetNameDef] and [SLE.GetLeader], and [SLE.GetLeader.GetSheHe] shall quake in fear as our armies march north to liberate the holy lands. May the Holy Flame forever keep us true to her!"
  MTS_usurping_mandate:0 "Usurping the Mandate"
  MTS_usurping_mandate_desc:0 "Through blood and sweat we have prevailed against the sinful fools that dared to corrupt the Empire as they did. However, there is only so much we can do to restore the glory of the Empire under Daybreaker, and it is with a heavy heart that we will have to lead in her place, which is truly an untenable task."
  MTS_soft_and_complacent:0 "Soft and Complacent"
  MTS_soft_and_complacent_desc:0 "The Solaris Adoratio was meant to be the backbone of the Solaris Cultus, supporting the Empress in every way, showing in the Scriptures how her words gave us meaning, and how they were nothing but truth and justice. Yet through the money they received in tithes, they grew blind and lazy, allowing unorthodoxy and heresy fester wherever it wished. They must be cleansed for the Empire to heal properly."
  MTS_immortal_blight:0 "An Immortal Blight"
  MTS_immortal_blight_desc:0 "No matter what we do, there will always be heresies. It is a fact of life. Where there are ponies, there will always be the degenerate and the renegade that wish to spread sin, sew devastation, and bring about the will of Chaos. Since we have stationed ourselves in the Empire's territory, heresy discoveries by the Inquisitionis have skyrocketed, yet little is ever found when they are raided. We must be on our guard."
  MTS_overweight_and_overdue:0 "Overweight and Overdue"
  MTS_overweight_and_overdue_desc:0 "Although a number of inquisitors from the Solaris Inquisitionis are innocent and dedicated to suppressing and destroying heresy wherever it appears, that does clearly not apply to the greater Inquisitionis as a whole. They let the sin fester and metastasize within the Empire, and they sat by as they grew fat off its intoxicating fruit. We shall remind them of their duty with the Holy Flame."
  MTS_crimes_against_faith:0 "Crimes against Faith"
  MTS_crimes_against_faith_desc:0 "Of the many priestesses that fell to sin in the Empire, some are more influential than others, especially those that spent their time within Sanctum Solar itself. Seen as paragons of the Empress, their teaching and their examples allowed the spread of more opulent and hedonistic thought to infect the society of the Empire at large. It is time that their sin be brought to justice, and melted off with the Flame."
  MTS_strip_churches_of_power:0 "Strip the Churches of Power"
  MTS_strip_churches_of_power_desc:0 "One way in which the corrupted Adoratio brainwashed the populace was through using the tithe money they received to decorate their churches to absurdity. The Empress cares not about how objectively beautiful the interior of a place of worship is, when the hearts are focused on it rather than her! These beacons of filth must be stripped of all that makes them beautiful for their members' own good."
  MTS_intangible_links:0 "Intangible Links"
  MTS_intangible_links_desc:0 "For weeks, attacks from clearly organized heretic cells have battered our troops and supplies, but there is no clear pattern to their raids, despite their obviously planned and coordinated nature. Of the inquisitors that are loyal and faithful to us, we will use them to infiltrate and scout, to hopefully find one of these cells and learn their intent, and, more importantly, who is their leader."
  MTS_apocryphal_made_vulgar:0 "Apocryphal made Vulgar"
  MTS_apocryphal_made_vulgar_desc:0 "Deep within the Imperial Palace, once guarded by inquisitors and praetorians alike, the Imperial Archives lay as examples of the arrogance and pride of the Inquisitionis and Adoratio. Although that very thought is distasteful, the greater problem is that the many scrolls and tomes these archives hold are not available to all! Secrets only imply heresy!"
  MTS_weak_and_incapable:0 "Weak and Intangible"
  MTS_weak_and_incapable_desc:0 "As the number of inquisitors that have been captured have grown, we have seen a recurring pattern. They simply do not have the desire nor the mental fortitude to remain committed to the Empress's every command, and cleanse heresy wherever it could potentially spring up. Therefore, we must use them as examples: anypony weak like these is not fit to serve the Empress, and will be judged like them. As failures."
  MTS_keep_status_quo:0 "Keep the Status Quo"
  MTS_keep_status_quo_desc:0 "As much as we would completely eradicate all those that cling to the corrupt, old ways of the Adoratio, if we push much more, it is likely that we will face an open revolt from those who still who are resistant. Sunset Shimmer has been imprisoned since we took Sanctum Solar, and she appears to be outside the plot of the Adoratio. Keeping her as its head will only ingratiate ourselves with our citizens."
  MTS_replace_corrupt_priestesses:0 "Replace Corrupt Priestesses"
  MTS_replace_corrupt_priestesses_desc:0 "With the last purges of the Adoratio complete, there is a large vacuum that must be filled to maintain proper levels of theological instruction and correction. Already all of the priestesses that came with us when we left the Empire have taken up their mantle, but there is one role, that of High Mage, that must be filled, and there is only one pony that Scorched knows that can fill it..."
  MTS_cauterizing_evidence:0 "Cauterizing the Evidence"
  MTS_cauterizing_evidence_desc:0 "If we are to ever eliminate heresy within our borders for good, we must take extreme measures to extract information. The Inquisitionis may be brutal in its tactics of torture, but they are still not getting results like we had hoped. Therefore, with the few remaining rebels we have, Scorched Earth will take the matter personally upon him, and finally find information on who is leading this strangely organized heresy."
  MTS_remove_abomination:0 "Remove the Abomination"
  MTS_remove_abomination_desc:0 "For years, the Inquisitionis was led by not a pony, but a force of nature, untamable even by the Empress herself. Lady Inquisitor Quasar Pulse is known for her excessive sadism and rabid commitment to removing all heresy. While normally not a problem, her magical prowess as a gravity-manipulating gravitar, is. All it will take is one slip and she could be at our throats. It is best to put her down, for the good of all."
  MTS_reinstate_gravitar:0 "Reinstate the Gravitar"
  MTS_reinstate_gravitar_desc:0 "Quasar Pulse has been the Lady Inquisitor of the Inquisitionis for years, and she has served almost sycophantically to ensure that heresy has been cleansed wherever it is discovered. Currently, she is held in isolation, where her gravity magic can be neutralized, but she has promised that all of us 'heretics' will be destroyed. However, she could see reason, if Scorced can convince her of our righteous path..."
  MTS_theology_of_nothing:0 "Theology of Nothing"
  MTS_theology_of_nothing_desc:0 "As far back as can be recalled by Scorched Earth or anypony else with him, the Adoratio promised that there would be blessing for those that followed the Empress's wishes, however, that vow has changed over time to de-emphasize the spiritual, which is the only reward needed, to instead focus on the material. It is time to re-focus on the truth of Daybreaker, no matter how unliked it may be."
  MTS_uncovering_secrets:0 "Uncovering Secrets"
  MTS_uncovering_secrets_desc:0 "After excessive digging through hunches and clues left by the heretics in their attacks, we have finally pinpointed who must be leading them: the Solaris Speculatores, which was the former intelligence wing of the Solaris Cultus. Their entire organization disappeared after our conquest, and it appears they've gone rogue. There is a likely meeting place in the next few days, and we would be wise to... interrupt it."
  MTS_keeping_few_shadows:0 "Keeping a Few Shadows"
  MTS_keeping_few_shadows_desc:0 "Through absurd amounts of research and investigation, it has been determined that the most likely group that is behind the organization of the heretics would be the Solaris Speculatores, the intelligence wing of the Solaris Cultus. Recently a few coded messages to Scorched have requested he meet with the sender privately. It is illogical, but, it appears they want to talk. It is best to not keep them waiting."
  MTS_only_empress:0 "Only the Empress"
  MTS_only_empress_desc:0 "Many have forgotten their first pledge, to serve the Empress without fail, as weapons for her to use to cleanse and protect Equus. They have placed their trust in themselves, their wealth, their material possessions, or others, yet not in her. Enforcing that the Empress be the focal point of all will get them back on track, or die in their failure."
  MTS_faithful_to_end:0 "Faithful to the End"
  MTS_faithful_to_end_desc:0 "Through the reinforcement from the newly restored Adoratio, our citizens are beginning to fall in line. If they do not, then they are quickly chastened with the Holy Flame. Everypony, if they know what is good for their eternal soul, will stand against any and all that oppose the Empress's plan of restoring Equus. Our enemies will not know peace while the Adoratio still serves."
  MTS_dictate_of_sun:0 "Dictate of the Sun"
  MTS_dictate_of_sun_desc:0 "It is clear that none that could normally fill the vacuum left by the Empress is capable of filling the role which she provided. While Scorched Earth is only one pony, he has led [MTS.GetNameDef] to greatness, to power, and to piety. There is only one who is worthy of taking the mantle of the Empress, and it is him alone."
  MTS_zealous_to_last:0 "Zealous to the Last"
  MTS_zealous_to_last_desc:0 "Our soldiers have been drilled until they will break no further, for to surrender, to accept the easy, simple way out, is to accept death of the soul. No matter how many fall, they will always be willing to die for the Empress, lest their weakness allows the enemies of Order overrun the Empire."
  MTS_freeing_mortal_coil:0 "Freeing the Mortal Coil"
  MTS_freeing_mortal_coil_desc:0 "With our land and faith united, we must return to the task of which the Empress originally set out: restoring the power of the Empire and freeing the lands of Equus from all those who would exploit and despoil them, and lead them astray into materalism. Emperor Earth will claim everything for the Empress, or the whole world will burn instead."

  ###Pre-War###
  MTS_changing_guard:0 "Changing of the Guard"
  MTS_changing_guard_desc:0 "Against all odds, Scorched Earth has backed down from his position and yielded to the Solaris Adoratio, Warm Night in particular. He will remain a leader in the Militarium, but has decreed that the Adoratio will lead while he studies further some of the Scriptures to solidify his theology. We shall see what the priestess does, now that she is in charge."
  MTS_warriors_mistake:0 "A Warrior's Mistake"
  MTS_warriors_mistake_desc:0 "Although the General's enthusiasm for his beliefs led to rapid progress, those developments are already showing their inherrent weaknesses as crime rates have grown and poverty is still rampant. Unlike what he says, having less doesn't automatically make ponies focus on Daybreaker, and showoing him his mistakes could bring him around strongly to Warm Night's position."
  MTS_faithfuls_folly:0 "The Faithful's Folly"
  MTS_faithfuls_folly_desc:0 "It is a common interpretation of the Inquisitionis's mission of serving and protecting Daybreaker that it requires harsh and exacting laws and punishment, but that is not the only interpretation. To stay dogmatic, when there is just as much support for other views is foolish. Convincing Luminous Blade of such would provide Warm Night some sway with the Inquisitionis, if she succeeds."
  MTS_curious_curios:0 "Curious Curios"
  MTS_curious_curios_desc:0 "New Horseleans society is starkly different from that within the Solar Empire, and has proven to be a shocking exposure to many of the Adoratio and Inquisitionis, who have never ventured outside of its borders. This has only piqued the curiosity of Warm Night, who has always searched for a way to draw more ponies to Daybreaker. Perhaps there is something that can be learned from COBSOC's social ideals?"
  MTS_troubles_of_cult:0 "Troubles of the Cult"
  MTS_troubles_of_cult_desc:0 "To most ponies, the whole Solaris Cultus appears united and whole, with little division aside from when somepony goes rogue and is dealt with. However, like any large organization, there are multiple moving cogs and ambitions that must be checked. Rumblings of unrest in the Inquisitionis against Warm Night have been growing for weeks, and she must be careful, lest the inquisitors oust her for hetreodox behavior."
  MTS_general_conspiracy:0 "The General Conspiracy"
  MTS_general_conspiracy_desc:0 "To say that the transition from General Earth to Warm Night was a popular decision would be lying. The other officers that broke off with General Earth have voiced their displeasure the moment General Earth resigned from leadership of [MTS.GetNameDef]. They have not outright defied her, but it would not take much for them to look the other way if somepony were to try something against her..."
  MTS_hitting_books:0 "Hitting the Books"
  MTS_hitting_books_desc:0 "An important aspect of any society, let alone Imperial society, is a strong grasp of a multitude of concepts that keep a citizen a productive servant of the Empress. Not only has standard Imperial education been lacking, but New Horseleans has had education problems supposedly for years. Mixing our teachings with theirs should provide the bridge needed to rebuild society."
  MTS_fine_stagnation:0 "Stagnation at Its Finest"
  MTS_fine_stagnation_desc:0 "Unsurprisingly, when all motivation for work has been destroyed through "lean" concepts or simply not prioritizing repair work, productivity plummets. [MTS.GetNameDef] is just barely continuing to function and it is debatable if it could have survived under Scorched Earth. Funding reconstruction efforts will be expensive, but will pay off with much more faithful citizens in the end."
