  ###Leader Descriptions###
  POLITICS_SCORCHED_EARTH_1048_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of August, 1009 near Whitebell\n\n§YBiography§!: Scorched Earth grew up in a world where there was no memory of harmony and love between ponies. At the tailwind of the \"Placated Generation,\" all of his earliest memories are nothing but war and suffering, as first changelings, then communists ripped across the battered Equestria and nearly caused its collapse.\n\nIn the first months of the Great War, his family fled from some of the pegasi cloud settlements near the changeling border to the relative safety of the Canterlot region. When Daybreaker ascended, Scorched Earth was little more than a young colt obsessed with the war stories of returning veterans of the "War with the Bugs." In the ensuing years, he enlisted into the rebranded Solaris Militarium and saw action on the front lines against the South-East, whenever incursions from the various communist cells crossed the thin border between the nations.\n\nWorking his way through the ranks, he achieved the position of major after only a few short battles, all of which were ended by decisive, planned action from troops under his command. For a time, he worked with fellow officer Solar Strike to quell some nascent heretics in the central region of the Solar Empire before returning to Ordo Maris to work with its archmage, Ion Trail, and keep the peace. Over time, however, he grew more irritated with the growing decadancy of the Empire, and made no qualms about voicing his displeasure.\n\nWith the advent of the South-East's crumbling and his own assessment that the Solar Empire has become too fat and lazy to effectively accomplish anything, he has taken a page from Solar Strike. Having marched his army of the 4th Glorious Flame and many volunteers who agree with his view on the Solaris Adoratio out of the Empire, he has established a new order in a basecamp in former communist territory.\n\nTrue to his name, Scorched Earth has aggressively subdued the local population, and instituted martial law while destroying much of what has been deemed "excessive luxury". With heretics routinely executed and all sources of entertainment or relaxation ending up banned, life is questionably better under nominal Imperial rule than Cobalt Hoof. However, subjugating the entire South-East for Daybreaker is Scorched Earth's goal, and if it cannot be won, then it can burned to the ground instead.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: OpalRadiance"
  POLITICS_LUMINOUS_BLADE_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!§L: 23rd of April, 1020 in New Canterlot\n\nIf ponies in the Solar Empire think of an inquisitor, it is likely that an image close to Luminous Blade comes to mind. Although she is of a younger generation than that of the first inquisitors, she is no less their equal in piety, zealotry, and devotion to Daybreaker and purging darkness from wherever it may be hiding in the Solar Empire, or elsewhere on Equus.\n\nWhen Luminous was growing up, the Empire was in its final process of fracturing. Chaos was rampant in the distant fringes of Daybreaker's territory, and she and her family evacuated from the town that would later become New Canterlot to the heart of the Empire, to settle in Ponyville. From there, she was given a relatively sheltered life, as her parents mistrusted most of the citizenry there, after numerous incidents of heresy and subsequent retaliations from the Inquisitionis. However, no shielding would prevent her from receiving the stories of the brave inquisitors as they fought to protect the Empire, entrancing her with ideals of glory underneath Daybreaker.\n\nAs she reached her late teens, she applied for the few spots allowed for public admission into Daybreaker's School for Blessed Unicorns, although she was ultimately rejected for her average magical scores. That did not deter her, and she instead tutored under some of the acolytes in Ponyville itself, eventually earning recognition as an initiate into the Inquisitionis and placing among the other servants of Daybreaker.\n\nAt first, her innocence hindered her progress, as she was quick to trust heretics she was sent to investigate, but after multiple corrections, she was forged into a dutiful mage to keep order within the Empire. As her first true placement of duty, she was assigned to Scorched Earth's legions to keep order and root out potential heresy, although she only instead served to temper some of his most outlandish ideals.\n\nStubborn and naïve, she holds to a slightly more traditionalist mindset compared to him and frequently keeps his mission focused on clearing heresy, rather than personal crusades against all material wealth. Although she has been on record of being harsher with pegasi, she has yet to express any dislike of her superior, and faithfully serves him day in and out.§!\n\n§YPortrait By§!§L: OpalRadiance§!"
  POLITICS_WARM_NIGHT_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 21st of July, 1014 in Sire's Hollow\n\nAs a pony who grew up in the worst decade of the Empire's existence, Warm Night has experienced both the lows and highs of life under Daybreaker. Raised in a border town of little influence with the Empire and the eventual South-Eastern Governorate, she was exposed to the propaganda of the Adoratio from an early age, whose purported blessings conflicted with her family's existence.\n\nBeing the eldest daughter in her family, she was left with watching her two younger siblings while her parents toiled for hours supporting the Militarium's supply routes as the Empire fought for control of the South-Eastern peninsula. When one of the branches of the Adoratio opened a church school within the town, she was sent to learn the necessities to help her parents. Instead, a passion was ignited for using the resources of the Adoratio to truly help others, a desire that sometimes conflicted with the requirements of correction within the Order.\n\nDespite consistent disagreements, she received a commission to remain in the region of Mareway, with the intent that she would learn from her superior, Serene Shore, a mellowed fire for aid that would be tempered with the teachings of the Adoratio. After reaching Mareway, she organized different charity events, which while popular with the citizenry, started to breed additional unorthodox or heretical thought within them.\n\nRarely is an Adoratio priestess allowed to deviate far without correction from the Inquisitionis, but with Mareway's relatively unimportant location, her thoughts and ideas continued to grow, which she eventually convinced a number of her fellow priestesses to follow. To her, Daybreaker, being the supreme alicorn that she is, is obligated to help the other ponies with a firm, but gentle hoof that has yet to be displayed. Heresy would surely disappear if ponies followed her out of true love rather than fear.\n\nAs she learned of COBSOC's disastrous policies in the South-East, her heart turned toward its ponies and their eventual liberation. When Serene Shore agreed to support Scorched Earth's expedition as a theological guide, Warm Night soon became his strongest critic of his policies. However, until she is able to apply her own at the head of Militem Solar, what she says is only hot air in the breeze, and it will remain a theory if Solarism can really support everypony, faithful or not."
  POLITICS_PINPOINT_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 20th of February, 1017 in Ponyville\n\nArchmage Pinpoint is a rather obscure inquisitor within the ranks of the Solaris Inquisitionis. Little is known about her beyond her date of birth and the town from which she supposedly was born, and any attempts to delve further have been unsuccessful. Rumors abound based on her sometimes erratic, frequently obsessive behavior that she is one of the fabled and feared gravitars, ponies that can meld gravity itself to their magic's power, that rarely appear within the Empire.\n\nInformation is inconclusive on if she was born in Ponyville, and if she was, when she left or when she studied to become an inquisitor. Coincidental evidence of a gravitar born within the town comes from news reports of a family found dead in their house after it virtually imploded in a freak accident. When the Inquisitionis quickly responded, it was deemed a microburst of wind and that all were lost, although reports indicate there was a single child that was never found.\n\nAlthough she infrequently speaks of her achievements, Pinpoint has always been upfront with her passion for study and her unfailing love for Daybreaker. Countless hours of hers have been spent perfecting religious science, straddling the line between heretical progress and research to further glorify the God-Empress. An all-consuming passion, like many inquisitors, is to eradicate heresy, but she wishes to go to the source. A source that she has no idea where it resides.\n\nAs the head researcher of the Militem expedition, she has extensive resources at her command, and her inner circle of likeminded, inquisitive and faithful inquisitors, have kept the nation knowledgeable but pure of corruption. Occasional requests for prisoners for experimentation are but a small price to pay to keep up with neighboring nations.\n\nObsessive, mildly paranoid, and fervently loyal to Daybreaker, Pinpoint has mercilessly decreed that she will be the destroyer of heresy, forever. Whether it can be cured with little damage to ponies remains to be seen. But that is only the cost of unwavering, undying love for the immortal God-Empress.\n\n§YPortrait By:§! MonsoonVisionz"

  MTS_unsanctioned_ordo:0 "Unsanctioned Ordo"
  MTS_unsanctioned_ordo_desc:0 "Since we have broken off and ignored direct orders from the God-Empress herself to return to the Solar Empire, our support with our most important neighbor is nonexistent. Only a few Adoratio priestesses have sworn to serve with us, which leaves [MTS.GetLeader]'s reign an unstable one."
  MTS_corrupted_conscripts:0 "Corrupted Conscripts"
  MTS_corrupted_conscripts_desc:0 "Although we have come with an entire legion of soldiers under [MTS.GetLeader]'s command, we still rely on conscripting the masses to maintain enough presence to exert influence in our territory. The communists are unwilling servants, leaving our auxiliaries rife with insubordination."
  MTS_ill_adapted_heat_tolerance:0 "Poor Heat Adaptation"
  MTS_ill_adapted_heat_tolerance_desc:0 "The Solar Empire's lands are warm, but the Empress's sun is nearly intolerable with the humidity and heat that is trapped in the jungles of the South-East. With the constant threat of malaria and other heat-borne illnesses, our troops are not an effective fighting force."
  MTS_miniscule_industry:0 "Miniscule Industry"
  MTS_miniscule_industry_desc:0 "Outside of New Horseleans, there are no other major industrial centers within [MTS.GetNameDef]. Even working around the clock, our workers struggle to keep up with the industry of other regions, even within the South-East."

  MTS_stepping_stones_desc:0 "As an induction into Militem Solar and the true way of joy and happiness, ponies will be required to relenquish some of their unused or underutilized items, and be expected to take a wage cut in their jobs. Freeing up money for other purposes will ease our future war effort."
  MTS_bridging_gaps:0 "Building Bridges"
  MTS_bridging_gaps_desc:0 "The differences that divide Solarists from the non-Solarists should be spanned. How will ponies know that they must submit their will to Daybreaker if they aren't first shown the care that those who follow her have for each other and their fellow pony?"
  ###Scorched Earth Pre-War###

  MTS_blood_for_sins:0 "Blood for Sins"
  MTS_blood_for_sins_desc:0 "If we do not induct ponies willing to do so immediately into the Militem through cleansing their very blood of their sins, then we will have failed the Empress.

  MTS_early_asceticism:0 "Early Asceticism"

  MTS_adoratio_council:0 "Council of Priestesses"

Although she makes any final decision, Daybreaker is surrounded by others who advise her, so that the wisest choices are made. As it is the pinnacle of leadership, it is best we emulate that ourselves, and have the best and brightest to assist. Also to be occasionally ignored."

Religion can be good, but too much with too little checks is simply asking for trouble."

  MTS_missional_guidance:0 "Missional Guidance"

  MTS_decentralized_theology_desc:0 "As we have already deviated significantly from the mainline orthodoxy of the Empire, which is corrupted and twisted against what Daybreaker always intended for us, we cannot deny others to hold their own interpretations of theology as well.

  MTS_dictated_worship:0 "Dictated Worship"
  MTS_dictated_worship_desc:0 "The corruption of the original teachings of the Adoratio and the original message of Daybreaker were simply because the Cultus, as its core, could not effectively police itself, and over the centuries, there was drift.

  MTS_everypony_soldier_desc:0 "In trying times such as these, the benefits of remaining a civilian sometimes have to be foregone. We are a fledgling nation, one that is now without hope of every receiving the acknowledgement it was due by the Empress.

  MTS_single_sisters:0 "A Single Sisterhood"
  MTS_single_sisters_desc:0 "As every priestess says: we are sisters and brothers under the Empress, but we the Cultus has remained inherently divided between the Inquisitionis and the Adoratio.

  MTS_fighting_at_home_desc:0 "While at one point the jungles of the South-East were oppressive and a detriment to us, they are now like our second home, and to many soldiers, their new home.

  MTS_loving_support:0 "Caring Supports"
  MTS_loving_support_desc:0 "There is still much that we can do to improve the lives of everypony, and it is a long and arduous task, but that does not mean we can ask for more sacrifices to get to our utopia.

  MTS_prosperity_without_cost_desc:0 "If we are to ever achieve our plans of a utopia under the Empress's watch, we must face the facts that time is our mortal enemy, doubly-so with our completely isolated position. Everypony will be dragged up to prosperity, but some may fall through the cracks as we transform our society into the dream that Warm Night always had."
  #^Reality of having to be more ruthless in improving the conditions of the South-East, which will leave some behind. This is only because the original plans of Warm Night would be too detrimental to the South-East in its current position
  MTS_paradise_of_southeast:0 "A Southeastern Paradise"
  MTS_paradise_of_southeast_desc:0 "With significant investment, our efforts have paid off, and we have achieved a level of care and support for our faithful citizens beyond that of any other nation on Equus. Every service a pony could need is available at a moment's notice, and all have been shown the mercy of Daybreaker to prick their guilty hearts."

  MTS_internal_relations_council:0 "Internal Relations Council"
  MTS_internal_relations_council_desc:0 "As we no longer have a unifying goal of achieving support of [SLE.GetNameDef], the risk of disagreements in our nation tearing us apart is far more real and apparent.

  MTS_peninsular_homeguard:0 "Homeguard of the Peninsula"
  MTS_peninsular_homeguard_desc:0 "Instilling a common goal and drive for keeping our freedom can have a serious motivating effect on ponies.

  MTS_private_spies:0 "Private Spies"
  MTS_private_spies_desc:0 "Unlike the other nations around us, we do not distrust our citizens to actively work against us.

Unchecked capitalism would only lead to eventual exploitation by those who could, and it is only through bands of workers can they be held in check. However, like any organization, a bit of corruption can set in, and changes are a tad slower to get done whenever a union decides to strike."

  MTS_seez_desc:0 "With it being situated on multiple important shipping lanes, [MTS.GetNameDef] is perfect for organizing and administrating an economic tariff zone, especially as Equestria regains its status as a dominant power on Equus. If anycreature from Zebrica or Western Equus wishes to get to the heartlands of Equestria, then they will need to come through us, and our taxes."
  #^General economic zone around the peninsula and with EQS
  MTS_seez_advantage:0 "The SEEZ Advantage"
  MTS_seez_advantage_desc:0 "Not only does the South-Eastern Economic Zone allow for a constant flow of revenue from tariffs and exports, tying our markets with Equestria's allows for efficient sharing of resources. Certain areas within Equestria are simply too expensive to feasibly operate, but in general, our lower costs allow for businesses to relocate, and therefore pay into our coffers so that we can help our citizens further."
  #^SEEZ allows for efficient sharing of manpower and resources, to allow for further economic growth, improving many ponies' lives, although at the expense of some jobs and wages
  MTS_manageable_army_size:0 "A Sensible Size"
  MTS_manageable_army_size_desc:0 "Beyond just the image of being a dictator, keeping a smaller army will mean that there are more ponies able to serve in a supportive capacity elsewhere. Additionally, reducing our headcount has a benefit of better logistics in the case of war actually breaking out."

  MTS_warriors_of_peace_idea_desc:0 "Most of those who served with us in the past are not eager soldiers. They fought for their freedom, but now that it's guaranteed by Equestria, they would rather see to their own safety and security, rather than fighting for everypony's. It is respectable, and given the number of ponies we need to provide aid to Equestria, there is just as much honor in building the tools that liberate others as actually doing the liberating."

  MTS_everypony_volunteer:0 "Completely Voluntary Service"
  MTS_everypony_volunteer_desc:0 "Our battles have been won, and the dead that were created by them buried. There is no need for us to send even more of our own back home in body bags. Although we must still have ponies who protect us, it must be because they WANT to do so, rather than because we require them. An eager soldier is a motivated soldier, and there is no way around that."

  MTS_mind_war:0 "Mind War"
  MTS_mind_war_desc:0 "If a battle can be won in the war room before others are tried on the battlefield, then we can ensure that our soldiers' lives will not be wasted. Immobilizing enemy forces before they even become a threat through special operations, tight planning, and coordinated strikes will all lead to less losses, and therefore, more ponies coming home. It is the only service which we can ask of our troops."

  MTS_volunteers_of_harmony:0 "Volunteers of Harmony"
  #MTS_volunteers_of_harmony_desc:0 "There might be a small dissonance between the ideals of Harmony and Friendship and willingly going to war, but that is something our soldiers will have to deal with when they're fighting on the battlefield of other Harmonists wishing to restore the balance of the world. We all have sacrifices to make."
  MTS_volunteers_of_harmony_desc:0 "Some would call a foreign legion dedicated to making peace in other countries a contradiction of the ways of Harmony. Perhaps it is, but the desire of our soldiers to spread the freedom they've found and the friendships they've made is too strong to deny. The good media coverage is a plus, too."
  MTS_liberation_warriors:0 "Warriors of Liberation"
  MTS_liberation_warriors_desc:0 "Our civilians back home practically worship the brave souls that go around the world to help bring peace and Harmony to other nations.

There is no reason why we cannot win with our troops under us."
  MTS_old_fashioned_violence:0 "Classic Conquest"
  MTS_old_fashioned_violence_desc:0 "Although we must continue to innovate in warfare and utilize every advantage we can get, there should never be a compromise on the backbone of what makes the military function.

  MTS_goddess_of_machines:0 "Goddess of Machines"
  MTS_goddess_of_machines_desc:0 "Some claim that the only things that are blessed by the Empress are the living ponies that serve her, and the hooves they use to carry out her justice. But those claimants would be wrong, as there is no reason that the Empire should only rely on flesh and blood alone. If it were not for technology, the Empress would have far less reach than she already has, and therefore, her very soul and might can flow into our weapons and give them power beyond belief."
  MTS_goddess_of_the_mechanical:0 "Goddess of the Mechanical"
  MTS_goddess_of_the_mechanical_desc:0 "The God-Empress's domain is not just of flesh and blood. Her might and reach overshadows all of creation, both living and inanimate. In many ways these machines and mechanized vehicles are just as much like any pony as a pegasus or unicorn, with their own quirks and personalities that must be work with to achieve an outcome. Almost, in a way, like there is the spark of the divine in them, and should be treated as such by the Cultus as well."

  MTS_cauterize_rebels_desc:0 "Unsurprisingly, the ponies of New Horseleans have not taken well to our occupation. However, we have the deck in our favor, since we hold the weaponry. It's time to use some of the ammunition to make a point, and reduce the number of mouths that will need to be supported later."
  MTS_warning_example:0 "Warn Through Examples"
  MTS_warning_example_desc:0 "There were numerous officers and soldiers who remained in New Horseleans to coordinate the defense, but most of the defenders were untrained ponies who were pressed to fight for their homes. One of Serene Shore's priestesses, Warm Night, advocates that they be spared, but the professionals punished, as a warning for any future rebels that we will not tolerate sedition."
  MTS_permanent_temporary_base:0 "Permanent Temporary Basecamp"
  MTS_permanent_temporary_base_desc:0 "Since New Horseleans is still devastated from our capture and subsequent punishment, there are few suitable locations for our forces to establish themselves. Keeping our troops near the edge of the city will allow quick responses to either unrest or impending attacks. It'll only be temporary, anyway."
  MTS_host_first_service:0 "Host the First Services"
  MTS_host_first_service_desc:0 "Not priestesses of the Adoratio have traveled with us, since the theology of [MTS.GetNameDef] is considered "heterodox," and therefore, not actively encouraged by the fat heads in Sanctum Solar. However, the contingent under Serene Shore have proven amenable to our ideals, and are already starting to instruct the basics of an ascetic lifestyle to the citizens."
  MTS_establish_inquisitor_teams:0 "Establish Inquisitor Teams"
  MTS_establish_inquisitor_teams_desc:0 "Only a few inquisitors dared to defy Lady Inquisitor Quasar Pulse and the Empress to travel with us, but they have already proven instrumental in maintaining order within New Horseleans. Now that resistance is spreading outside the city, it is time for Archmage Pinpoint to organize hunter-seeker groups to eliminate these before they become a threat."
  MTS_crack_down_on_thestrals:0 "Crack Down on Thestrals"
  MTS_crack_down_on_thestrals_desc:0 "As a haven of all things unclean, COBSOC had allowed the greatest insult to the Empress, the thestrals, spread out and settle in different regions. Due to their backward, tribal thinking, they have proven difficult to dislodge, but now that we have an Inquisitionis presence, we can dedicate many resources to wiping them from the face of the peninsula."
  MTS_first_faithful:0 "The First Faithful"
  MTS_first_faithful_desc:0 "Thousands have flocked to the words of Serene Shore and her priestesses and to show their desire to remain in the Empress's good graces, have volunteered to serve with us in an auxiliary capacity. These are untrained and still tainted with heretical ideals, but they could prove useful fodder when we expand to the peninsula."
  MTS_reconstruction_teams:0 "Reconstruction Teams"
  MTS_reconstruction_teams_desc:0 "There are numerous prisoners that have yet to be purified of their crimes. While we wait to uphold justice, we can use them for a benefit: There is much work that must be done to repair New Horseleans, and too few free bodies to do it."
  MTS_flush_out_jungles:0 "Flush Out the Jungles"
  MTS_flush_out_jungles_desc:0 "Some of the fledgeling resistance groups have taken shelter within the thick canopies of Hayseed Swamp and its surrounding jungles, harassing our garrisons that have been established in the largest settlements and otherwise inflicting casualties that we cannot replace. Thankfully, we don't need to actually search for them when burning them out will be just as effective."
  MTS_eliminate_commissars:0 "Eliminate Old Commissars"
  MTS_eliminate_commissars_desc:0 "Although most of the forces of COBSOC fled when the government collapsed, some stayed in the city to organize defenses against any potential attacks or uprising. These commissars are few in number, but hold much influence in fighting-aged ponies, and could prove to be a problem if allowed to live for much longer, which requires that we deal with them. Now."
  MTS_necessary_sacrifices:0 "Necessary Sacrifices"
  MTS_necessary_sacrifices_desc:0 "At the moment, ponies are reluctant to give up what few luxuries they have to focus all they can on the Empress and the prize that is promised in her. They cling to their trinkets and baubles like shiny pearls that will fade in only a short time, hindering our ability to mobilize for war. We must cut them off immediately, so they can learn to survive with what is strictly needed."
  MTS_solar_pressers:0 "Solar Pressers"
  MTS_solar_pressers_desc:0 "There is still much that can be done to shore up our position within the South-East, as we require many more bodies to supplement our forces, but also further development of infrastructure to mobilize for the war effort. Sending gangs of our soldiers into the cities to recruit new ponies will not be popular, but it is something that we must do if we want to survive. They might not, though."
  MTS_labor_for_empress:0 "Labor for the Empress"
  MTS_labor_for_empress_desc:0 "Although they can be used for vain accessories, the region in which we find ourself in is filled to the brim with natural resources that can be put toward our impending war with the other breakaways. However, with limited capacity for modern refining, for now, we will require of our citizens they sacrifice their time to improve our production lines, whether they want to or not."
  MTS_first_step:0 "The First Step"
  MTS_first_step_desc:0 "Now that many are primed for the ideas of [MTS.GetNameDef], it should be only a simple speech that will lead many to realizing the joy of simple lifestyles and training for conflict from Scorched Earth. The reduced strain on our industry will be a boon for reconstruction, as well as the reclaimation that could be done with their trinkets."
  MTS_first_bridge:0 "The First Bridge"
  MTS_first_bridge_desc:0 "To entice more ponies to learn about Daybreaker and her demands, Warm Night has proposed that we establish some community shelters for those most afflicted. Although it won't directly simplify their lifestyle, those that find aid there could be asked to assist with some of the building projects that are planned for the future, with the promise of shelter once done."
  MTS_theological_debates:0 "Theological Debates"
  MTS_theological_debates_desc:0 "The differences between Scorched Earth and Warm Night have reached a boiling point. Word has just arrived that the priestess is going to confront the General in his quarters. We can only hope that the guards arrive in time."
  
  ###Scorched Earth Pre-War###
  MTS_keeping_simple:0 "Keeping It Simple"
  MTS_keeping_simple_desc:0 "With Warm Night finally backing down on some of her absurd claims, it is time to turn our attention to the most pressing concern of the South-East: toppling the petty warlords and rival governments that have sprung up in the wake of COBSOC's collapse. At least there will be some easy solutions to this rather difficult problem."
  MTS_victory_with_less:0 "Victory with Less"
  MTS_victory_with_less_desc:0 "One of the first things that Scorched Earth requires be instilled to the new drafting base is that just because they will be fighting for the Empress does not mean they will be provided more, better equipment. A cunning warrior will win with what he has, and rely on his faith to get the job done, even if it has to be done with his bare hooves."
  MTS_restructure_poverty:0 "Restructure the Idea of Poverty"
  MTS_restructure_poverty_desc:0 "For decades, the ponies of the South-East were considered some of the most destitute and suffering ponies on all of Equus. However, that is not the case, for while they cry that they have been left to rot and die from lack of necessities, we must inform them that they have been prepared for this blessed moment! By having little, they will learn to be content with even less than before, and praise the Empress in so doing!"
  MTS_wealth_minimalism:0 "Wealth in Minimalism"
  MTS_wealth_minimalism_desc:0 "Architecture, factories, food, and other things do not need to be fancy, gaudy, or expensive to be effective. In fact, the simplest items are usually the most efficient, and in that, there is a wealth of blessings for anypony who looks for them. It's time we give our citizens this vital lesson so they may be prepared for the future."
  MTS_warriors_diet:0 "A Warrior's Diet"
  MTS_warriors_diet_desc:0 "One of the first things that we must do in preparation for conquering this cursed peninsula is get our recruits on a proper diet that they may be focused entirely on the Empress. COBSOC allowed them to grow decadent and fat, eating such nicities as maize or seaweed, when all they need is hay and wheat to survive. And thus, they shall be taught how to have this food, and like it."
  MTS_only_war_possessions:0 "Possesions only for War"
  MTS_only_war_possessions_desc:0 "In the short term, we can simply force our factories and our construction sites to remain prepared for funding the entirety of our liberation of the South-East. Nothing will be made for a pony's enjoyment, for everything will be meant to kill, maim, or eradicate when we march into the jungles of the peninsula."
  MTS_denying_life_rights:0 "Denying the Right to Live"
  MTS_denying_life_rights_desc:0 "The average pony believes that they are entitled to things they call "necessities," but that is something that [MTS.GetLeader] knows is ripe for perversion. Because of this, fasting will soon be implemented across all levels of society so that our new citizens can learn to deny themselves and instead focus on the Empress, like everypony should."
  MTS_forgo_needs:0 "Forgo Simple Needs"
  MTS_forgo_needs_desc:0 "Where there were once factories meant for providing basics like clothing and factory protective equipment, they are now being tooled into forges for the little requirements of an army. Boots, holsters, and other needs for a soldier will be met, but even then, they will be the minimum that is required to function, lest our own soldiers get haughty and think themselves above the Empress."
  MTS_everything_for_warrior:0 "Tool Everything for a Warrior's Hooves"
  MTS_everything_for_warrior_desc:0 "Many of the tool factories for farms or the Celestial Sea fisheries can be temporarily diverted to construct weapons for our warriors. The ensuing derth of civilian materials is no concern of ours, as they will learn to trust the Empress more to keep them alive in the wake of owning less."
  MTS_warriors_calling:0 "A Warrior's Calling"
  MTS_warriors_calling_desc:0 "Just like everypony is called to be a servant of the Empress outside of war, everypony within [MTS.GetNameDef] is called to be a warrior of the highest caliber, ready to sacrifice themselves on the battlefield in her name. Although that is the ideal, it is clear that the ponies of the South-East have grown soft from their luxuries, and we should focus on select demographics to induct into the military."
  MTS_sacrifice_everything:0 "Sacrifice is Everything"
  MTS_sacrifice_everything_desc:0 "In the perfect society, everypony will abstain from anything that could distract from the Empress. Whether that be food, clothing, housing, or even baser needs, all should be given up in service to the Empress. However, a majority of the populace isn't ready for that yet, but a select few have fully embraced our teachings, and are ready to charge into the midst of battles as our greatest shock troops."
  MTS_reconsider_extremes:0 "Reconsider the Extremes"
  MTS_reconsider_extremes_desc:0 "While it would be proper for every citizen to learn what it means to truly live with reliance on the Empress's mercy, there simply isn't enough time to properly train and prepare them, especially for some of the holiest and extreme ceremonies. For now, as suggested by Mage Luminous Blade, we shall drip-feed them theology, and they shall one day be ready."
  MTS_sanity_not_included:0 "Sanity not Included"
  MTS_sanity_not_included_desc:0 "Although many outside of [MTS.GetNameDef] would decry us as insane for our practices, they merely have been blinded by the temptations of this world. Even our very bodies can be an avenue for both sin and hedonism, so we must therefore purge any thoughts from us from time to time. There are ceremonies that are perfect for it, no matter how bloody..."
  MTS_poverty_is_a_concept:0 "Poverity is a Concept"
  MTS_poverty_is_a_concept_desc:0 "While our citizens continue to complain to us about how they have been slowly falling further into poverty, they have yet to realize, despite our instructions, that being poor is merely a state of mind. For if somepony is rich in spirit and love for the Empress, then they are rich indeed, no matter what sinful material possessions they have. For now, though, we shall humor them."
  MTS_retool_hedonism:0 "Retool Hedonistic Forges"
  MTS_retool_hedonism_desc:0 "As New Horseleans is the capital of the region of which we conquered, it is the major industrial center for this area of the South-Eastern Peninsula and therefore has many factories dedicated to keeping the citizenry placated and mentally blinded from the Empress. We shall not, though, completely demolish them all, for some could prove useful to our cause against [BAL.GetNameDef]."
  MTS_simply_war:0 "It's Simply War"
  MTS_simply_war_desc:0 "Despite our small numbers and our relatively "basic" military, we are blessed by the God-Empress herself, and our holy warriors will march across the peninsula to clear and cleanse it from all unrighteousness. Any that don't will be purged themselves."
  MTS_simply_society:0 "It's Simply Society"
  MTS_simply_society_desc:0 "While there are many steps that are still required, General Earth has successfully brought ponies on the path toward ascending to a new level with the Empress, by sacrificing all that they own to better themselves and hear the very word of the Empress. There is still much wealth and luxury in the nation, but it is a start."
  MTS_simply_economy:0 "It's Simply the Economy"
  MTS_simply_economy_desc:0 "Through our simplifying and restructing of the industrial base in New Horseleans and the surrounding region, we have turned the sluggish and sinful economy of COBSOC into a weapon that will plunge into the very heart of [BAL.GetLeader], and we shall see [BAL.GetLeader.GetHerHim] bleed!"
  MTS_introduce_holy_napalm:0 "Introduction to Holy Napalm"
  MTS_introduce_holy_napalm_desc:0 "A particular favorite tactic of General Earth, utilizing Holy Napalm to cleanse entire battlefields is a tried and true concept, that unfortunately we were unable to capitalize on when we first invaded the South-East. Now that we have a stronger production base, we can guarantee a constant supply of the holy weapon, and we shall see the peninsula burnt to ash around us!"
  MTS_spread_ascetic_inquisitor:0 "Spread the Ascetic Inquisitor Concept"
  MTS_spread_ascetic_inquisitor_desc:0 "Since we have a number of inquisitors that left with us, we should lean further upon their support. While Mage Luminous Blade already followed General Earth's teachings, and even helped establish them, there are other inquisitors who need further instruction. From there, we can spread the word throughout the nation, and streamline the Inquisitionis's function within and without in their hunt for heresy."
  MTS_wise_rejection:0 "Wise Rejection"
  MTS_wise_rejection_desc:0 "It appears that our instructions have finally started to bear fruit, as more ponies are growing disinterested in attending their heathen public schools - which were mostly destroyed anyway - and learning directly from the Adoratio. Already, literacy and understanding in basic theology is improving, and we can hope for properly well-educated citizens within a few years."
  MTS_require_charity:0 "Require Adoratio Charity" #Maybe change this to mandatory Adoratio time ministering to the soldiers
  MTS_require_charity_desc:0 "In order to properly evangelize the nation, the Solaris Adoratio requires a certain amount of money, as much as we are loath to admit it, which has been still been hard to come by since we arrived here. Ponies, in general, are not willing to part with their filthy lucre to give the Adoratio their proper dues. But who said that the request had to be optional?"
  MTS_lean_as_possible:0 "As Lean as Can be"
  MTS_lean_as_possible_desc:0 "By applying some of the concepts that we used in improving the industrial base of New Horseleans, we can further cut down cruft and inefficiencies in our supply lines. A few incentives here and there by properly... encouraging loyalty will go a long way to those who wish to keep their safety net within [MTS.GetNameDef]."
  MTS_unleash_empresss_wrath:0 "Unleash the Empress's Wrath"
  MTS_unleash_empresss_wrath_desc:0 "We have built [MTS.GetNameDef] into a single weapon with a sole purpose: eradicating the heresy and hedonism that resides on this peninsula. It is time that we remind them all why the Empress should never be crossed."
  
  ###Scorched Earth Post-War non-opulence###
  MTS_southeastern_triumph:0 "South-Eastern Triumph!"
  MTS_southeastern_triumph_desc:0 "With the final surrender of the remaining South-Eastern holdouts, we have claimed this peninsula for the Empress and restored a large section of the Empire that was lost for decades! May the souls of our fallen brethen be honored this day by the purging of all heresy from the South-East!"
  MTS_warriors_commitment:0 "Warriors Without Commitments"
  MTS_warriors_commitment_desc:0 "While our soldiers fought valiantly, it is undeniable that the ponies that we conscripted to sacrifice for the Empress have yet to closely embrace the teachings of General Earth. Many still hold to family, friends, or whatever few possessions they still have, and we must instill in them a higher calling."
  MTS_organized_expectations:0 "Organized Expectations"
  MTS_organized_expectations_desc:0 "We did haphazardly construct much of our military's regimen after we stabilized New Horseleans, since the time we had to capitalize on [BAL.GetNameDef]'s weakness was limited. This has led to much confusion in our ranks on what constitutes adequately ascetic. It is time we set a baseline for them to achieve, before we go further."
  MTS_harsher_expectations:0 "Harsher Expectations"
  MTS_harsher_expectations_desc:0 "Since we did not have proper time to instruct all of the tenets of Militem Solar when we first conscripted many of our recruits, they have already backslidden into lax, hedonistic practices, such as food breaks! We must double-down on every aspect of being a soldier for the Empress, no matter unpopular."
  MTS_march_on_nothing:0 "Marching on Nothing"
  MTS_march_on_nothing_desc:0 "As we are all servants of the Empress, we must all learn how to be happy with nothing, if she so deems it. It is doubly important for a soldier of [MTS.GetNameDef] to be content no matter their situation, and therefore, we will start to drill them with the strictest of expectations for readiness at a moment's notice."
  MTS_lessons_of_jungle:0 "Lessons of the Jungle"
  MTS_lessons_of_jungle_desc:0 "Before we reconquered the South-East, tactics revolving around jungle warfare had been over two decades old, which left us woefully unprepared for anything that the communists or thestrals would throw at us. Thankfully, through grit and blood, we have adapted to some of the realities of this peninsula, and our doctrinces have benefited."
  MTS_luxurious_pain:0 "Pain is a Luxury"
  MTS_luxurious_pain_desc:0 "Most of our recruits from this subcontinent have pathetic tolerance for hardship. They don't realize that even the very pain they feel as they bleed, as they are sacrificed to the Empress, is a blessing, for that is the only way they truly know they are alive. Some further trials will instill the respect of agony that they need."
  MTS_discipline_succeeds:0 "Discipline will Succeed"
  MTS_discipline_succeeds_desc:0 "Although our troops could still stand to further sacrifice anything for the Empress, they have already been strictly drilled and instructed, so that they may one day fully embrace the loss that the Empress requires of us. Even under a hail of bullets, they will never break or fall back."
  MTS_theatre_of_learning:0 "Theater of Learning"
  MTS_theatre_of_learning_desc:0 "We have an ideal backyard for specializing our troops in various theaters of war. From the deep jungles to the soaring mountain ranges, our soldiers will know how to fight in every condition and carry the Empress's will to the ends of Equus!"
  MTS_zealotry_will_win:0 "Zealotry will Triumph"
  MTS_zealotry_will_win_desc:0 "Through effort and stringent punishment, our recruits are finally beginning to accept that they are nothing without the Empress. Every breath they take, every move they make, is only permitted by her will. If we march again against the enemies of Daybreaker, they will crush everycreature beneath her unwavering hoof!"
  MTS_empress_unachieved:0 "What the Empress Couldn't Achieve"
  MTS_empress_unachieved_desc:0 "It is undeniable that the South-East lay as a stain upon the Empress's record as one of the greatest indignity that was ever suffered by the Empire. For all her promises, she never sought to retake this land, which leaves General Earth with a great claim: accomplishing something that the Empress was incapable of doing herself. Truly, he is one of the greatest military leaders of our time!"
  MTS_remove_want:0 "Removing All Want"
  MTS_remove_want_desc:0 "Our civilian industry, while small, is still hungry for resources that are rightfully meant only for the Empress's finest. While some cry out for more aid to meet their demands, we shall answer with less, until everypony accepts that they only need the Empress's love."
  MTS_simplified_forges:0 "Simplified Forges"
  MTS_simplified_forges_desc:0 "Asceticism need not only be applied to the lives of our citizens in what they use themselves. Many nations have a pointless series of guidelines that they call a building code, which are nothing more than ways to prevent the most practical designs from being used to save on time wasted that could be spent producing for the Empress. Eliminating this will further augment our weapon yields with more forges."
  MTS_metals_galore:0 "Metals Galore"
  MTS_metals_galore_desc:0 "There is an uncountable amount of metal used in fruitless things like kitchen utensils or other luxuries as bedframes or similar items that many of our citizens have within the nation. However, those resources could be better used for the production of weapons, so that we do not have to scrape for every piece of iron that must be refined into steel. It's not like any of the beforementioned items are needed, anyway."
  MTS_ceaseless_lines:0 "Ceaseless Lines"
  MTS_ceaseless_lines_desc:0 "While the idea of sacrificing sleep to get something done is not new, it will be enforced to ensure that our production lines remain constantly at work. Ponies should consider it a blessing and a luxury if they are allowed to return home after a full, twenty-four hour day of labor, since the Empress herself never rests from protecting us. It is the least they can do to afford her the same service."
  MTS_want_not_waste_not:0 "Want not Waste not"
  MTS_want_not_waste_not_desc:0 "While we have sapped most of the small items from our citizens and used them for more practical purposes, there are still larger vehicles, machinery, or the like that are needless when ponies could simply rely on the Empress instead. However, these provide opportunity for us to further improve our independence from natural resources, as we slowly recycle anything and everything that we can."
  MTS_utilize_last_as_chattel:0 "Utilize the Last as Chattel"
  MTS_utilize_last_as_chattel_desc:0 "Many of the abominable thestrals were killed in our conquest of the South-East, yet not all of them were eliminated in fire. Our prisons are filled with the vile creatures, and while standard procedure would be to burn them all to cleanse the world of their taint, there is nothing preventing us from utilizing for more pragmatic purposes. Utilizing them could begin their repentance early."
  MTS_pure_government:0 "A Pure Government"
  MTS_pure_government_desc:0 "Until now, there were still a number of bureaucrats who worked in COBSOC running the nation. Not all of them were rabidly loyal to his ideals, and were happy to turn to the Empress, or at least feign love for her. However, their minds are still corrupt, and we must make every effort to fill our ranks with likeminded ponies from General Earth's general staff, lest the risk of a COBSOC coup ever become a reality."
  MTS_thankless_job:0 "A Thankless Job"
  MTS_thankless_job_desc:0 "Like all inquisitors, Mage Luminous Blade has tirelessly worked to keep the Empire and the Empress safe from any heretical threats; but on top of that, she has pledged herself to be Scorched Earth's lifelong guard, so that his mission will succeed. While all of the Empire's inquisitors deserve thanks, she above all, needs some acknowledgement of her sacrifice, especially in the wake of her war injuries."
  MTS_vexations:0 "Vexations"
  MTS_vexations_desc:0 "General Earth has been having... thoughts, as of late. He has been more reclusive and uppity, and there is little explanation why. Since his private meeting with Mage Blade, he has gone out of his way to avoid spending much time with her, or denying her his person to guard. Hopefully the general leaves his funk soon and can return to his normal performance."
  MTS_goddesss_light:0 "The Goddess's Light"
  MTS_goddesss_light_desc:0 "According to the general, his mind has yet to be put at ease with whatever is troubling it. Nopony has been told who, what, or why he had such a shift in personality, although a few wonder if he has been hexed by Discord or a vengeful thestral. It appears he will be seeking aid, as he has recently departed for the Cultus's primary church in New Baltimare, where he can hopefully get aid."
  MTS_quiet_contemplation:0 "Quiet Contemplation"
  MTS_quiet_contemplation_desc:0 "Since his last visit to the Adoratio's church, the General Earth has been far less jumpy, although whatever cure the priestesses have provided appear to have left him absentminded or foggy. Already, it is getting better, though, and he has promised after the next visit to the church, he will be right as rain. In a way, he seems almsot happier."
  MTS_show_meal:0 "Meal and a Show"
  MTS_show_meal_desc:0 "As there are a number prisoners and heretics who have yet to be properly judged and punished, General Earth - who has since been refreshed from the priestesses' assistance in his mysterious ailment - has decreed that the remainder will be brought forth to be punished. He has requested less security, however, stating that Mage Blade will keep him safe. He did appear rather flustered when he mentioned her."
  MTS_not_so_ascetic:0 "Not So Ascetic After All"
  MTS_not_so_ascetic_desc:0 "It cannot be confirmed, but rumors are circulating that there is something more to the relationship that General Earth and Mage Blade now share. Nopony dares ask either of them, however, so it will remain unclear unless one of them admits to their crime of abandonment of the Empress's calling. Whatever happened, they work better now than ever before."
  MTS_legitimize_militem:0 "Legitimizing [MTS.GetNameDef]"
  MTS_legitimize_militem_desc:0 "Many of our beliefs are in contention within the Empire itself, as the primary church in Sanctum Solar has not sanctioned most of what Scorched Earth holds to be true. However, we are not heretics, as we still hold to the same tenets as the rest of our brothers and sisters. Now that we have liberated the South-East for the Empress, Sunset Shimmer must surely welcome us back with open arms."
  MTS_to_be_saved:0 "To be Saved"
  MTS_to_be_saved_desc:0 "Everypony should be at least shown the way to salvation from their sins, even if most will never achieve because of their love of filthy lucre and other forms of hedonistic thought. Through some careful preaching from the Adoratio, we should be able to craft a slightly better image of us to the citizenry, and then lay the groundwork for future ascetic lifestyles."
  MTS_to_be_holier:0 "To be Holier"
  MTS_to_be_holier_desc:0 "It is a requirement of everypony to be as holy as the Empress herself, although all of us fail. However, it is clear that the general citizenry of the South-East are incapable of remaining loyal or loving to the Empress, which means that we will have to herd them until they are incinerated for their sins. The zealous among us will chafe to enact this policy, especially if we bring the light to further nations."
  MTS_loss_is_gain:0 "Loss is Gain"
  MTS_loss_is_gain_desc:0 "Ponies hold far too strong attachments to the things that they own. They have yet to realize that all goods are gifts from the Empress, and that because she provides them, she can just as easily take them away. Therefore, the ascetic lifestyle is ideal, as it sacrifices all possible to give back to her, and it maintains low needs, so that if things are lost, they cause little pain. If only more saw it that way."
  MTS_simple_means_easy:0 "Simple means Easy"
  MTS_simple_means_easy_desc:0 "As there is a truthfully self-inflicted housing crisis within the nation, we require a quick and easy method for us to rebuild and house those that were displaced. We do this not out of a kindness of our heart, for they should all be happy living where they are, but we do this out of necessity, lest more unrest begins to foment. One day, these will be torn down, just as easily as they are erected."
  MTS_singular_focus:0 "Singular Focus"
  MTS_singular_focus_desc:0 "As the brightest torch of the Empress, all of [MTS.GetNameDef] should be ready to fight and die for her and the Empire. Leave the worries of the afterlife, the economy, the farms, to other ponies, for we will be the sword that strikes directly into the heart of the Empress's enemies and our inquisitors the fire that melts away all heresy!"
  MTS_suffering_life_and_next:0 "Suffering in Both Lives"
  MTS_suffering_life_and_next_desc:0 "Although it is unlikely to truly reward them with eternal salvation, by promising our citizens that they will more likely be heard in prayer or given preference in death by denying their loves of money, things, spouse, or child, they should become willing to charge into the lines of enemy fire. Already, these messages have struck some chords, as our recruitment numbers are up. A new generation of servants await!"
  MTS_sanctification_mission:0 "Missions of Sanctification"
  MTS_sanctification_mission_desc:0 "By appealing to some of the aspects of the primary church in Sanctum Solar, we can encourage our followers and our priestesses to serve primarily in spreading the word of Daybreaker's salvation, and giving guidelines on sanctification. These may be different from Sanctum Solar, but they are still within orthodoxy, and should give us a legitimacy in the rest of the Empire."
  MTS_punishment_mission:0 "Missions of Punishment"
  MTS_punishment_mission_desc:0 "As the representative of Daybreaker, it is our mission to ensure that the heresy is kept minimal and heretics are punished wherever they are discovered. Appealing to the office of Lady Inquisitor in Sanctum Solar, we should encourage all of our loyal troops and Cultus members to further reverence, and legitimize our standing within the eyes of the Empire."
  MTS_minimalist_transcendence:0 "Minimalist Transcendence"
  MTS_minimalist_transcendence_desc:0 "Through extreme self-denial and constant meditation, some of our younger priestesses have offered to commune and learn from Daybreaker more so that we may stay on the right path. Even General Earth views them as a bit excessive, but we can't deny they've given us some insights into how we can utilize ponykind's innate magic further."
  MTS_minimalist_fury:0 "Minimalist Fury"
  MTS_minimalist_fury_desc:0 "As our inquisitors have striven harder, they have denied more of their own needs to ensure the body of the Empire continues to be preserved, nourished, and protected. Even now, their hunger and anger drives them to fight in new and creative ways against the heretics, which has led to an overall boon for our companies in battle."
  MTS_claiming_new_home:0 "Claiming Our New Home"
  MTS_claiming_new_home_desc:0 "With the fall of [BAL.GetNameDef] and the surrender of the other regions, we have asserted our dominance upon the entire peninsula! The prize that awaits us the port city of Baltimare, now such a large megalopolis that a distinct region has been designated for the entirety of COBSOC's government. We now have the capacity to flush out the last resistance here and set ourselves as the official rulers of the land."
  MTS_determining_finest:0 "Determining the Fittest"
  MTS_determining_finest_desc:0 "Among the prisoners, heretics, and abominations, there are many ponies who, while enemies of Daybreaker, could be used for something more than just an example what happens to those who turn their backs from her. We shall set criteria that must be met by the captives. If they are blessed enough by her, they will easily qualify and be rescued from the Holy Flame, only to serve their lives toiling for her."
  MTS_begin_purification:0 "Begin Reign of Purification"
  MTS_begin_purification_desc:0 "Hundreds of thousands of ponies have fled into the jungles and rurual villages, seeking safety from us, since they believe that we will harm them or their way of life. Ironically, it is this very action that have now doomed them. If they stayed in the cities, they would be spared, but now that they harbor with heretics, they will be given the same fate as we cleanse this land with the Holy Flame!"
  MTS_dying_breaths:0 "Use Their Dying Breaths"
  MTS_dying_breaths_desc:0 "Ponies are like resources: they do not last forever. While we still are able to bolster our workerforce through the useful prisoners which we hold, we should aim to rapidly grow our cities and towns to provide a base for crafting the Empress's weapons of war. Many of the captives will likely die in this effort, but when did that ever matter?"
  MTS_discard_waste:0 "Discard the Waste"
  MTS_discard_waste_desc:0 "Of the prisoners that were not deemed worthy of serving the Empress in labor, the rest will be used as either cannon fodder or as examples to those that are still free. Whether they be heretic, abomination, or enemy, they will all provide an identical message: the Empress will be obeyed, no matter the price."
  MTS_flatten_cities:0 "Flatten the Corrupt Cities"
  MTS_flatten_cities_desc:0 "As an ultimate insult to the Empress, the damned thestrals have had cities this entire time, deep in the jungle and near the base of the Scale Mountains! These must have been one of the ways that they have remained so populous and so much a thorn in the Empress's side as creatures of darkness. There is only recourse for their existence, and that is to end it. With fire."
  MTS_burn_jungles:0 "Burn the Jungle to Ash"
  MTS_burn_jungles_desc:0 "A large percentage of the thestral population and a number of communist cells reside in the deep thicket of the peninsula's jungle, which they believe will stymie us in our dedication to eradicate them. While it is a noble goal, they are sorely mistaken on the lengths we'll go to purify this peninsula. If we have to burn down every square inch to see heresy cleansed, so be it!"
  MTS_wide_applications:0 "Wide Applications"
  MTS_wide_applications_desc:0 "The principles that we exercised in sifting through the fit and unfit from ponies that we captured have proven largely successful. Not only have we had many examples to display to dissuade heresy, but we have also created an auxiliary workforce that can be utilized twenty-four-seven. Cementing this principles into law will greatly enhance any of our future conquests, and speed the integration of new lands in the process."
  MTS_holy_justice:0 "Holy Justice on a Grand Scale"
  MTS_holy_justice_desc:0 "As a tried and true method, the use of fire and napalm to cleanse lands of taint and heresy has been proven yet again as we've cleared the South-East of much of its corruption. Considering that General Earth is a proponent of just such policies, it should prove trivial to implement and standardize how future lands are cleaned for our use. It will involve flames. Lots of flames."
  MTS_solar_south_east:0 "A Solar South-East"
  MTS_solar_south_east_desc:0 "With the last of the cells of communists destroyed and the thestrals purified or captured, the South-East is finally within the domain of the Empress again. There will still be unrest, but now those loyal to us will begin the process of healing the nation, and preparing it for the inevitable return into the Empress's embrace directly. Until that day, may we celebrate our efforts together!"
  MTS_pure_peninsula:0 "A Pure Peninsula"
  MTS_pure_peninsula_desc:0 "For decades, the South-East has been a haven for scum, villains, and thestrals, but now that we have brought it back into the fold, we have established this subcontinent as a beacon of light and loyalty for the rest of Equus to see. Our citizens now serve without question, and every day, more flock to the Empress's name that they may be saved. We shall all stand in her might, and we shall walk into her embrace, as one!"
  MTS_return_journey:0 "The Return Journey"
  MTS_return_journey_desc:0 "With the South-East stabilized and an example for all within the Empire, it is time we petition that the Empress hear us, and welcome us back with open arms. General Earth is confident that he will be accepted, and it will only take a short letter for us to finally know of our fate."
  
  ###Scorched Earth SOL accepted###
  MTS_southeast_mandate:0 "Mandate of the South-East"
  MTS_southeast_mandate_desc:0 "The dispatch from [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] is clear: the Empress demands that we establish a more stable nation than one run on the blood, sweat, and tears of all of her followers. While it is disappointing that she has not Seen Scorched Earth's wisdom, we cannot disobey, as she is offering us an eventual path back to fellowship with the Empire."
  MTS_desire_crisis:0 "A Crisis of Desires"
  MTS_desire_crisis_desc:0 "While we have been in a constant state of war or war-readiness, our citizens were willing, to a point, to tolerate harsher living conditions. Now that it is clear that the Empress wants to usher in a wave of peace and prosperity, they have clamored to begin to refill their pantries and, a demand our current economy cannot meet. For the sake of [MTS.GetNameDef], it must be addressed."
  MTS_faith_crisis:0 "A Crisis of Faith"
  MTS_faith_crisis_desc:0 "Although the population has pledged themselves to serve the Empress, they are still in their infancy of their faith journey. Without a clear, stated reason why they must continue to supposedly suffer and starve compared to their brethren in [SLE.GetNameDef], they have begun to actively protest against the Cultus and Scorched Earth himself. This insult to the Empress cannot stand forever!"
  MTS_body_crisis:0 "A Crisis of Body"
  MTS_body_crisis_desc:0 "It was kept quiet while we were prepared for war, but it is now growing difficult to contain that disease is running rampant through much of the civilian population. Although they should be healthy, they are failing basic tests. A number of our medical staff have proposed solutions, but they all involve things which General Earth stands completely against. But what are we to do if we want to stave off collapse?"
  MTS_loosen_straps:0 "Loosen the Straps"
  MTS_loosen_straps_desc:0 "Adoratio Priestess Warm Night has approached us with some compromises that we can implement in order to ease the anger and struggling that many of our subjects experience. These may be antithetical to many of Scorched Earth's teachings and tenets, but with most of the population refusing to work without some form of relenting on our part, we have little choice but to comply."
  MTS_imperfect_union:0 "Imperfect Union"
  MTS_imperfect_union_desc:0 "The relaxed demeanor that General Earth has had for the number of months has quickly deteriorated as he has taken upon himself more of the administrative work required in these trying times for both us and our citizens. Clearly many things are stressing him, but Mage Blade has promised that he is doing well. Hopefully she can get through to him with time."
  MTS_reopen_SECDC:0 "Reopen the South-Eastern Center for Disease Control"
  MTS_reopen_SECDC_desc:0 "As the Great War raged on in Equus, Princess Celestia at the time established a small number of advanced medical centers for treating then-unseen injuries and diseases. The South-Eastern branch of the Center for Disease Control continued under COBSOC, but we shuttered it for costs and for the frivolous services it provided. However, with this blight of ill-health, it may be time to resurrect it."
  MTS_complete_demobilization:0 "Complete Demobilization"
  MTS_complete_demobilization_desc:0 "Both the calls from Warm Night and a few other priestesses and the demands of the ponies protesting their quality of life are too strong to ignore. The Empress mandated that we maintain a stable Ordo within the South-East, and if we push them too far, we could see a civil war break out. Therefore, we must meet their requests, even if it means we will no longer be prepared to fight in a war if need be."
  MTS_retain_preparedness:0 "Retain a Level of Preparedness"
  MTS_retain_preparedness_desc:0 "Although it is undeniable that the citizens want a complete return to pre-Imperial life, that is simply not possible. However, that does not mean we cannot compromise and establish a fairer, more balanced system, so that we can still maintain some level of readiness for further militarization, but also give the citizens some of their required luxuries back. Hopefully it will at least please some."
  MTS_seeking_sanctification:0 "Seeking Sanctification"
  MTS_seeking_sanctification_desc:0 "A dark cloud has figuratively settled over the General's head for the past few weeks, to the point that even Mage Blade has been hesitant to speak with him or guard him. It has not been a problem, as other soldiers can pick up the slack, but something must have happened between the two. Lately, he has spoken of seeking forgiveness, but it is not apparent if he refers to the Empress or somepony else."
  MTS_establish_reasonable_quotas:0 "Establish Resonable Quotas"
  MTS_establish_reasonable_quotas_desc:0 "With the SECDC already improving the health of all of our citizens, it will be no issue to retain an acceptable number of troops to be prepared in case the Empress calls us into war with the changeling threat or elsewhere against heretics. It will not be a popular move among the general population, but we have a great gift in the number that can serve, and it would be a sin to not make use of it."
  MTS_to_minimum_capacity:0 "Reduce to Minimum Capacity"
  MTS_to_minimum_capacity_desc:0 "To maintain security within our borders, we must have a certain level of ponies serving in our branch of the Militarium at any one time. On top of that, the Empress does require us to contribute in the case of a war with heretical nations. However, there is some leeway within, and to appease our restless populace, we will announce new quotas for recruitment that must be met, which please all parties involved."
  MTS_limit_excesses:0 "Limit Excesses"
  MTS_limit_excesses_desc:0 "Clearly the truly ascetic lifestyle is not fit for everypony, as is typified by the population of the South-East. Even those that at one point served readily have begun to backslide, and Scorched Earth has finally admitted that he might have been a bit too extreme too quickly. While we will still require of everypony to not be distracted from the Empress, a few luxuries will not hurt anypony."
  MTS_civilize_interior:0 "Civilize the Interior"
  MTS_civilize_interior_desc:0 "Even with the thestrals cleared from the jungles, the Neighua and other tribalistic groups have lived mostly without interference for close to half a century. As a first step toward bringing them into the fellowship of the Empress and entering the eleventh century, we should begin with connecting our nation's major cities together, as it will also allow for faster communication and supplies, if needed."
  MTS_better_and_worse:0 "For Better and For Worse"
  MTS_better_and_worse_desc:0 "Recently the General has appeared more at ease, although he still will not discuss what exactly has been eating away at his conscience these last few months. The occasional disappearance in the night has also been worrying, especially if it is for some secretic hedonistic activity. He has slipped away again, this time for far longer, and we can only hope that whatever he is doing, it's for the best for [MTS.GetNameDef]."
  MTS_form_southern_guard:0 "Form the Southern Guard"
  MTS_form_southern_guard_desc:0 "While we may never have a military as large now as the Empress herself, that does not mean that we will be useless. General Earth has had decades of experience, something that he will be sharing with a new wing of our Militarium branch focused primarily on heavy destruction and rapid response to incursion. These vanguards will have enough firepower to crush any foreign incursion rapidly!"
  MTS_peninsulas_flagship:0 "Flagship of the Peninsula"
  MTS_peninsulas_flagship_desc:0 "Since we first arrived here, we have relied on small ship tactics to take advantage of the coastal regions around the South-Eastern Peninsula and simply outnumber the enemy where possible. However, to integrate within the Empire's navy, Evening Tempest has helped design a battleship that will be on par with anything within the Empire. We will use it to crush our enemies from afar!"
  MTS_moderate_economy:0 "A Moderate Economy"
  MTS_moderate_economy_desc:0 "With our new laws in place, alleviating what the citizens claim are the worst of the oppressive economic institutions, we have created an amalgam of our own teachings and those of the mainline Adoratio. While this syncreticism is not popular among the loyalists of General Earth, all of us agree that it is required in order to please the Empress."
  MTS_ultimate_secret:0 "An Ultimate Secret"
  MTS_ultimate_secret_desc:0 "Lately, General Earth and Mage Blade have been seen together again, and apparently whatever that happened between them is resolved. Once again, the General has returned to a calmer state, and has actually apologized to a few of his aides that he treated harshely. What has exactly transpired in his life will forever remain a mystery."
  MTS_ultimate_truth:0 "An Ultimate Truth"
  MTS_ultimate_truth_desc:0 "Since the General has spoken with Mage Blade within the last few weeks, he has appeared calmer and less nerve-wracked. Some of our officers have grown quite curious what kind of hold she seems to have on him, since they have been spotted together, alone, many times and fueling rumors of an affair. Perhaps, though, it is best to leave it be. He will speak of it when he wants."
  MTS_oiled_machine:0 "A Well-oiled Machine"
  MTS_oiled_machine_desc:0 "Since the SECDC has been restored, the health of our population has been on the mend. Between stricter exercise regimens and different diets, the cases of malnourishment - the problem behind all their ailments - has drastically been reduced. Like a finely-tuned and oiled machine, those that still serve with us have a new energy to them that will make them willingly march into the pits of Tartarus itself!"
  MTS_overwhelming_production:0 "Production Overwhelming"
  MTS_overwhelming_production_desc:0 "As the South-East is a well of rich natural resources, as one of our greatest acts of sacrifice to the Empress, we should work at claiming more of it from the deposits we know and returning it to the Empress in the form of trade and weapons. Further extraction will also lead to increased steel yields within forges, that we may use in helping both the populace and the military."
  MTS_mine_mountains:0 "Mine the Mountains"
  MTS_mine_mountains_desc:0 "Recent surveys have suggested that most of the Scale Mountains are rich with crystals that can be used to power the matrices that are used in our magical energy weapons. From the samples taken, they appear to be of the highest caliber, useful for military and civilian use alike in complex machines, which makes them perfect for the Empress."
  MTS_masters_of_jungle:0 "Masters of the Jungle"
  MTS_masters_of_jungle_desc:0 "Through grit and determination, we have become the masters of the jungle, supplanting the cursed bats and backwards Neighua as ponies well-adapted to the heat, humidity, and pests that infest the canopies. Our soldiers will navigate any maze of flora and come out the other side unscathed, while using it as a trap for any foes that dare to charge into our lands in an attempt to defeat the Empress!"
  MTS_normalcy_returned:0 "Return to Normalcy"
  MTS_normalcy_returned_desc:0 "At last, [MTS.GetNameDef] has become the exemplar Solarist nation on Equus! Because of the labor that Scorched Earth has given us for all these years, we have cleansed the peninsula and ensured a populace loyal and loving to the Empress.\n\nSoon, the book of history on [MTS.GetNameDef] will close. §YForever.§!"
  
  ###Scorched Earth SOL rejected###
  MTS_deitys_condemnation:0 "A Deity's Condemnation"
  MTS_deitys_condemnation_desc:0 "It seems completely unbelievable! The Empress has rejected us and claimed that we are a heretical, false Ordo? It's an impossible claim, but Scorched Earth has gotten the missive himself from [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], and there is no mistaking the stamp. We are now alone against an angry goddess..."
  MTS_rejections_sting:0 "The Sting of Rejection"
  MTS_rejections_sting_desc:0 "Normally a single pony is declared a heretic when condemned by the Inquisitionis. Rarely, it could be an entire village or town, but so far it has been clearly indicated that EVERYPONY within [MTS.GetNameDef] have been designated heretics. This has hit many of our inquisitors particularly hard, and we can only hope they recover soon."
  MTS_stunning_defeat:0 "A Stunning Defeat"
  MTS_stunning_defeat_desc:0 "Although it is the knowledge of every officer they cannot claim victory every time, Scorched Earth was extremely confident that the Empress would accept us back into her arms. Since the word of the Empress returned to him, he has remained locked in his quarters, and has seen few ponies. We have been left rudderless in the roughest storm of our lives, and hopefully we do not suffer for it."
  MTS_empty_faith:0 "Empty Faith"
  MTS_empty_faith_desc:0 "The Solaris Adoratio has always been the most united of the branches of the Solaris Cultus, yet even the priestesses that have come with us have not been spared rebuke and punishment. At this time, they are carrying out their duties for the populace, but many have entered a state of despair. What is their meaning if they cannot have fellowship with the Empress?"
  MTS_new_revelation:0 "New Revelation"
  MTS_new_revelation_desc:0 "At last, General Earth has emerged from his quarters with a new revelation. We have not been rejected by the Empress, we have been rejected by those who command [SLE.GetNameDef]! The hedonism that he grew wary of in the Empire has clearly spread and usurped all power the Empress has! We must rescue her if we are to ever bring stability back to Equus!"
  MTS_purity_of_will:0 "Purity of Will"
  MTS_purity_of_will_desc:0 "If we are to succeed in our quest, then all of the soldiers within [MTS.GetNameDef] must be of one mind and one will, never wavering from the objective to liberate the Empress from the corrupted ponies that have wrested control of the Empire from her. We are the only thing that stands between complete chaos and hedonism and order and salvation. We cannot fail!"
  MTS_purity_of_mind:0 "Purity of Mind"
  MTS_purity_of_mind_desc:0 "As the sole pony who will take on the brunt of the burden to liberate the Empress, Scorched Earth must ensure that he is completely focused and mentally clear, capable of sound judgement and wise decision-making at a moment's notice. For that purpose, he shall train more than ever before to be a razor-sharp knife that will gut the corruption of the Empire."
  MTS_purity_of_body:0 "Purity of Body"
  MTS_purity_of_body_desc:0 "A country is like a giant organism, and just like the ponies that make up our fighting arms must be pure, so much the rest of the civilian body, as they must be ready to sacrifice everything to see our mission accomplished. Preparing them for the war to end all wars will be the hardest thing we have ever done."
  MTS_needless_soldiers:0 "Needless Soldiers"
  MTS_needless_soldiers_desc:0 "Every soldier will be from the moment of their induction into the Militarium taught the very highest concepts of a warrior's ascetic lifestyle. If they do not conform they will be killed. When our military is nothing but soldiers who march for not even the food provided, then we will return the Empress to her power, as we drown our enemies in faithful blood."
  MTS_officers_of_less:0 "Officers of Less"
  MTS_officers_of_less_desc:0 "A military is a hungry animal, and our officers have been doing wonders since we came here to keep the entire operation running as smoothly as possible. But to ensure we have enough for the influx of ponies that will be fighting under us, we must tighten the belt, and our commanders will simply have to make do with what they have."
  MTS_war_of_soul:0 "The War of the Soul"
  MTS_war_of_soul_desc:0 "As we are all treading into uncharted territory, it is a terrifying thing to contemplate what will happen to the Empire once we achieve our goals. Nopony has been affected more by this than General Earth, who is clearly battling within on what actions he should take against his former brothers and sisters. Unfortunately, it is only a decision he can make."
  MTS_iron_sharpens_iron:0 "Iron Sharpens Iron"
  MTS_iron_sharpens_iron_desc:0 "It is not only General Earth who has taken it upon themselves to be at the very peak of their physical and mental prowess. Luminous Blade has also pledged to train as much as he, and both of them have recently started to train together, which has already seen improved results beyond what either could do by themselves."
  MTS_sacrifice_basics:0 "Sacrifice the Basics"
  MTS_sacrifice_basics_desc:0 "If we are to reach the lofty goal that we have set for ourselves, then every citizen must learn to live with far less than they already have. Every factory still dedicated to meeting their inane demands will be retooled for churning out guns and ammunition, and will likely never be returned to a pre-war state. They should get used to hearing "no" a lot more often."
  MTS_meals_are_hedonistic:0 "Meals are Hedonistic"
  MTS_meals_are_hedonistic_desc:0 "Providing sustenance for our soldiers is top priority, even if it means requiring our civilians to go without food or water. They should take this as an opportunity to rely solely on the Empress's strength and power to remain filled, instead of the sin of resting assured on a body's own vitality."
  MTS_simple_extraction:0 "Simple Extraction"
  MTS_simple_extraction_desc:0 "Through greatly simplifying the kits of our soldiers, we can easily standardize and streamline every unit's logistics and maintain a rapid, responsive military. Although they might have to struggle a bit more to achieve the same tasks, our soldiers will no doubt cause every corrupt pony within the Empire to bleed dry."
  MTS_blood_for_blood:0 "Blood for Blood"
  MTS_blood_for_blood_desc:0 "As the Empire is significantly larger than us and has had several large-scale battles to test their tactics on, we will be at a disadvantage if we attack immediately upon declaring war. Instead, we will make them come to us, which will provide us with a home turf advantage, especially as every soldier will fight to their last breath instead of be captured."
  MTS_one_unit:0 "As One Unit"
  MTS_one_unit_desc:0 "The consistent time that they have spent together have left General Earth and Mage Blade as a well-functioning unit, to the point that they can predict some of their suggestions or ideas. There appears to be more than just that spark, but they have become a truly perfect duo, capable of leading the military into the heart of the Empire without hesitation or misstep."
  MTS_no_production_missed:0 "No Production Missed"
  MTS_no_production_missed_desc:0 "In lieu of the number of factories that we need, we shall isntead require of every worker in the Empire to labor twice as hard to meet our end goals of overwhelming production. The factories will no longer close, and everypony shall work at least sixteen hour days before permission to rest for a short while. Our armories shall fill with weapons meant for liberation!"
  MTS_eliminate_living_standards:0 "Eliminate Living Standards"
  MTS_eliminate_living_standards_desc:0 "Ponies can have no quarter to complain about living standards if we remove all concept from society of such a thing. Soon, to live will simply be enough, that then ponies may serve the Empress with their waking breaths, and anypony caught mentioning a time before with even basic needs being met will be silenced. Permanently."
  MTS_pain_of_existence:0 "Pain of Existence"
  MTS_pain_of_existence_desc:0 "To properly appreciate the pain that everypony should feel at the loss of the Empress's command of the Empire, we will require our soldiers to sacrifice everything, body, soul, and mind. When they are driven into such a fervor that they will wish to fight through all of Sanctum Solar itself, we know that we will have done enough, as we loose them upon the heretics in the north."
  MTS_prepare_against_inevitable:0 "Prepare against the Inevitable"
  MTS_prepare_against_inevitable_desc:0 "It is more than likely that the corrupt souls within the Empire will attempt to snuff our light out before we finalize our military preparations. In case of this, we shall construct a mighty series of fortifications across the northern stretches of [MTS.GetNameDef], as a guard against attack and provide us the time we need."
  MTS_fruitless_invasions:0 "Fruitless Invasions"
  MTS_fruitless_invasions_desc:0 "The enemy may try to take our lands, but we will give them no satisfaction in doing so. With so little tying them down, our soldiers and citizens can freely move further into the peninsula, whilst leaving nothing behind. Let our foes starve as they attempt to survive in the jungles of this hellish peninsula!"
  MTS_life_taxes:0 "Life Taxes"
  MTS_life_taxes_desc:0 "While we may deride the idea of monetary funds, they are still required at this time to accomplish many feats. To further fund our military machine, we will begin taxing ponies simply for being alive. After all, their life is a blessing from the Empress, and they would dare not deny her the money she's for that, would they?"
  MTS_shared_abodes:0 "Shared Abodes"
  MTS_shared_abodes_desc:0 "A number of ponies within the South-East have grown accustomed to living independently, without sharing rooms with families or even strangers. If we are to reach our total capacity, we weill need to eliminate this concept, as we jam more ponies into smaller spaces to erect great war forges for the Empress."
  MTS_nothing_but_empresss:0 "Nothing but the Empress's"
  MTS_nothing_but_empresss_desc:0 "Our entire society is going through a radical shift. Before, we have still allowed at least some small pieces of respite, whether meeting with family, a few hours of meditation, or something else, but with our situation dire, we will require that everypony, no matter how young or old, to toil and give up possesions for the Empress. It is the only way we shall survive."
  MTS_salvation_to_thestrals:0 "Salvation to the Thestrals"
  MTS_salvation_to_thestrals_desc:0 "Although the damnable thestrals will never truly know the joy of living in the blessings of the Empress, they can at least bgin to repent of their sins of existence by being used by us. There are thousands of their kind living within our prisons, waiting for a proper execution, and now they shall be given it, through dying on the battlefield."
  MTS_united_in_devotion:0 "Unified in Devotion"
  MTS_united_in_devotion_desc:0 "As they are a perfect team, General Earth and Mage Blade have been sharing more and more of their knowledge with each other, and with the Militarium at large. It is no wonder that General Earth has finally decided that, to fill gaps at the highest eschelons, that she will be given a true role by his side, as the other leading general of [MTS.GetNameDef], so that she may lead as effectively as he."
  MTS_way_of_squire:0 "Way of the Squire"
  MTS_way_of_squire_desc:0 "As a final blessing to our soldiers, we shall be providing them with many new and useful weapons for their forray into the Empire. These parting gifts shall be a reminder to them of their duty, just as a squire would be required to serve his or her lord with absolute faith and humility. With these, our soldiers shall achieve complete victory!"
  MTS_live_to_die:0 "To Live is to Die"
  MTS_live_to_die_desc:0 "It is still a mystery to some how so many are willing to die in battle against our foes, whether they win or not. However, as the scriptures of the Adoratio say, to live is to die for her will, and to die for her is to gain salvation. We shall ensure that everypony knows this, that they will see paradise if they perish in combat to her."
  MTS_cost_of_luxury:0 "Cost of Luxury"
  MTS_cost_of_luxury_desc:0 "The one thing that the hedonism of COBSOC allowed was many redundant factories and material to be acquired on short notice through the ruins of the many, pointless living quartesr or factories that they once utilized. These shall feed our industrial efforts for years to come."
  MTS_rescue_empress:0 "Rescue the Empress!"
  MTS_rescue_empress_desc:0 "The final judgement of the corrupt ponies who now control the Empire has come. We shall strike at their very throat so that the Empress may be freed from her prison and lead ponies again into greatness and peace!"

  MTS_empire_freed_desc:0 "Against all odds, we have beaten back the corrupt forces that have usurped the Empress's throne! Our faith has given us the strength we need to overcome all evil, and as such, we shall establish a new Empire that will stretch from coast to coast!"
  MTS_preaching_new_gospel:0 "Preaching a New Gospel"
  MTS_preaching_new_gospel_desc:0 "The vile twisting of the Adoratio in Sanctum Solar have no doubt played a role in the corruption that infested the Empire and its territories. Thankfully, the ponies of the land are like sponges and will soak up any teaching of the Empress, especially if it is the truth. Therefore, we will dispatch our pure priestesses to proclaim the good, ascetic news of salvation to the masses."
  MTS_restoring_order:0 "Restoring Order"
  MTS_restoring_order_desc:0 "For the time being, General Earth will remain in control of the Empire, while he sifts through the lies and deceptions that plague the Imperial Palace, until every single pony responsible for the heinous actions that led to our liberation has answered for their crimes, and stability within the Empire is returned."
  MTS_breaking_nobles_backs:0 "Breaking the Nobles' Backs"
  MTS_breaking_nobles_backs_desc:0 "With our command of the Empire, we now finally have an opportunity to eliminate the one thing that has been a thorn in the Cultus and Militarium's sides since their inception: the damned nobility and their impressive ability to avoid any and all work for the Empress. Their fortunes will be destroyed, and then so will they."
  MTS_appointing_new_clergy:0 "Appointing a New Clergy"
  MTS_appointing_new_clergy_desc:0 "It is clear that the very heart of the Adoratio that resides within the Empire's territory has been blackened by sin and theological darkness. They preach more about how the Empress will bless everypony who follows than how to be one who blesses, and they give wrong information at that! Redeeming the office of High Mage is the first of the solutions that will be required."
  MTS_threat_quarantined:0 "A Threat Quarantined"
  MTS_threat_quarantined_desc:0 "Normally, whoever is the Lady Inquisitor provides a balance on some of the teachings of the Adoratio that they do not become heretical and lead ponies astray; however, the current Lady Inquisitor, Quasar Pulse, is an unstable sycophant who believes that she will please the Empress in everything. This, at least, allows us to mold her back into a model pony to help us."

  MTS_bitter_honesty_desc:0 "Since we have taken the Empire, [SLE.GetLeader] has been placed under house arrest, so that Scorched Earth may question [SLE.GetLeader.GetHerHim] when the time is right. With the majority of tasks completed in stabilizing the Empire, that time has now come. All shall be revealed soon enough."
  MTS_purifying_sanctum:0 "Purifying the Sanctum"
  MTS_purifying_sanctum_desc:0 "For hundreds of years, Sanctum Solar, or as it was once called, Canterlot, has been the seat of government and through that, has grown wealthy and fat. Despite the Empress's cleansing when she fended off the communists of Stalliongrad, it was rebuilt with even more splendor, encouraging further hedonism. We shall remedy that this day with the Holy Flame."
  MTS_cleansing_cities:0 "Cleansing the Cities"
  MTS_cleansing_cities_desc:0 "A small but yet influential group of ponies have remained rich and spoiled in the Empire, as they either had ties with the Palace or they helped to control the public companies that forged the weapons and armor of the Empire. However, their status will not deter us. Some of their filthy hooves were the cause of this coup against the Empress, and it shall not go unpunished."
  MTS_integration_perfected:0 "Integration, Perfected"
  MTS_integration_perfected_desc:0 "We are all the same pony, following the Empress through thick and thin and trusting in her power to save us in our deaths. We must preach this far and wide within in the Empire, so that citizens finally agree to our yoke so that we may sanctify them further."
  MTS_new_dynasty:0 "A New Dynasty"
  MTS_new_dynasty_desc:0 "The revelations of [SLE.GetLeader] have been nothing short of shocking. Even the General has been silent to ponder exactly what was told to him. However, he has stated that a new procolamation will come today. Whatever it is, it will surely rock the Empire as well."
  MTS_occupation_perfected:0 "Occupation, Perfected"
  MTS_occupation_perfected_desc:0 "With most occupying forces, there is little similarity between the ponies that have conquered and the ponies that have been conquered. This is not the case with us, as our soldiers and those we occupy share many of the same beliefs, and already have a common bond. If we highlight this further, it should reduce the hatred that our warriors experience, and lessen subversive activity."
  MTS_torch_continent:0 "A Torch to the Continent"
  MTS_torch_continent_desc:0 "Like the South-Eastern Peninsula before, the continent of Equus is still a haven of hedonism and sin. With the entire Empire now at our disposal, it will be foals play to achieve the Empress's initial vision of uniting the former lands of Equestria together. General Earth will lead us to salvation, so that we may burn the corruption that has festered for decades to ash!"

  MTS_last_torch:0 "The Last Torch"
  MTS_last_torch_desc:0 "The impossible has happened. The God-Empress, who was the savior of all ponykind, has been overthrown. The corruption that was in the fringes of the Empire has boiled over and usurped control! There is nothing left that we can do to save the Empress, but we can carry on the Holy Flame and burn the heretics who ousted to ash!"
  MTS_living_sacrifices:0 "Living Sacrifices"
  MTS_living_sacrifices_desc:0 "Every follower of the Empress must be prepared to fight with their lives to keep the Holy Flame burning. The wretched scum that we have inherited from [BAL.GetNameDef] are nothing but cowards, and while they did serve in the war to retake the Peninsula, they have clamored for demobilization. They shall instead be met with further recruitment, more taxing regimen, and a constant message: their lives are forfeit to serve the Empress."
  MTS_warriors_knowledge:0 "Warriors' Knowledge"
  MTS_warriors_knowledge_desc:0 "A soldier must not only be somepony who can wield a gun, but they must also understand the tactics of war itself. Most of our recruits have only received teaching in the former, and little in the latter. Thankfully, General Earth and his inner circle are a wealth of tactical information, with which we can further the development of our army and retake the Empire."
  MTS_promote_minimal_lifestyle:0 "Require the Minimalist Lifestyle"
  MTS_promote_minimal_lifestyle_desc:0 "Every stallion and every mare that works within our military, let alone the rest of society, will need to have complete devotion with absolutely no distractions from the coming liberation war, nor from worshiping the Empress in all their actions. Therefore, if they wish to live, they will begin living on the barest of necessities immediately, lest their sin prevent them from victory."
  MTS_smarter_asceticism:0 "Smarter Asceticism"
  MTS_smarter_asceticism_desc:0 "While science has in general only led to increased luxuries and further descent into barbaric hedonism, the method of research and development itself is not wrong. Although there are many tools that can corrupt it, utilizing it to further enhance our own weaponry will provide us with an easier time in rescuing everypony on Equus, so long as heresy can be avoided."
  MTS_useless_sight:0 "Useless Sight"
  MTS_useless_sight_desc:0 "The cursed thestrals, while embodiments of evil, are uniquely qualified for life in the Peninsula. Although it is a begrudging admission, if we were to research how exactly they were able to ambush so many of our troops at night, we could possibly provide our soldiers with an edge during nighttime combat with the help of a bit of magic."
  MTS_simple_weapons:0 "Simple Weapons for Simple Warriors"
  MTS_simple_weapons_desc:0 "There is a time and place for advancement, but now is not that time. Instead of looking into new and unseen weapons that could take years to properly pay off, it is better if we improve and simplify our production and weapon base, so that we can further supply our soldiers, which are ever expanding, with the best weaponry possible. It is the only way to save the Empire."
  MTS_glass_cannons:0 "Glass Cannons"
  MTS_glass_cannons_desc:0 "Initial successes in innovating our designs have led to a few different possibilities. Most of our tank prototypes have been specialized for some task or another, but to see which is truly the best, it will require a head-to-head demonstration of them all. Most promising are anything with large guns, as what point is armor if you destroy the target before they can fire?"
  MTS_one_with_jungle:0 "One with the Jungle"
  MTS_one_with_jungle_desc:0 "To further our magical enhancements, we have taken the remaining thestral prisoners which we have and begun to properly experiment on them. While initial tests regarding eyesight could have been better, to learn how exactly they thrive in the jungle itself will be a boon to our forces. Sometimes, using the sinner can lead to something righteous after all."
  MTS_worthless_compared_to_eternity:0 "Worthless compared to Eternity"
  MTS_worthless_compared_to_eternity_desc:0 "We must be clear with our soldiers: nothing that they do, outside of serving the Empress, will ever save them from their sins. But that does not mean they are without hope. As we continue to drill into them the ideals of Daybreaker, we shall ensure they understsand that their deaths in battle will give them instant sanctification, further motivating them to charge the enemy in sacrifice."
  MTS_defender_of_solarism:0 "Defender of Solarism"
  MTS_defender_of_solarism_desc:0 "As the last light of the Empress on this planet, Scorched Earth has become the shield that any who are oppressed by the sinners and heretics of this world. The warm sun of the Empress shines upon him, providing him strength to carry out her last wishes and restore the Empire to its glory. May his aim be true, as he stabs into the heart of the heretics!"
  MTS_immaterial_possessions:0 "Immaterial Possessions"
  MTS_immaterial_possessions_desc:0 "Many ponies think that because we are taking away their earthly pleasures, that they will suffer for all of eternity. While some of them no doubt will, they must be made to understand that, while it is painful, their sacrifice will provide a greater benefit once they pass on, so long as they trust in the Empress. This should be more than reassuring enough for anypony."
  MTS_sacrifice_of_things:0 "Sacrifices of Things"
  MTS_sacrifice_of_things_desc:0 "Ideally, as we bring about the perfect world under Daybreaker's vision, we must realize that possessions of any sort are strictly distractions from the worship of the Empress. While this does not disallow tools or other useful items, they must be seen as a means to an end, not an end of themselves. Further restricting civilian access to supplies will only reinforce this idea, for their benefit."
  MTS_sacrifice_of_time:0 "Sacrifices of Time"
  MTS_sacrifice_of_time_desc:0 "There is no concept of free time in an ideal world. Anypony who believes that their will is bound to anything but the Empress's is only deluding themselves, and instead should be instructed on the ways with which they could serve her better. By busying them further, we should soon see returns on military production."
  MTS_nopony_owns_anything:0 "Nopony will own Anything"
  MTS_nopony_owns_anything_desc:0 "To further the requirements that ponies already have for living standards, they will be forced to give up even their privately owned utensils, sheeting, anything. If it was something that was purchased, it is now the Empress's, to be used as we see fit. This will not normally change anything, but items with useful materials will made ours completely, so that they can be utilized for better purposes."
  MTS_expand_worker_grottos:0 "Expand Worker Grottos"
  MTS_expand_worker_grottos_desc:0 "When we retook the South-East, many of the buildings that once housed the workers of COBSOC were destroyed, and many ponies have been living on the streets since then. While this should have humbled them, the cry for housing has been deafening, and we shall meet their demand. They might have been crammed in with three to a room, but now it shall be ten! The only practical solution that will solve our issues."
  MTS_no_more_hedonism:0 "No More Hedonism"
  MTS_no_more_hedonism_desc:0 "Although it was sparse, COBSOC did provide its citizens with avenues of state-doctored entertainment, all of which were lies spewed about the Empress. However, the mindless masses found these enjoyable, and as a way to combat the practices, the media shall not only be silenced, but removed entirely. It is a waste of time to read a comic or watch a movie, when it could be spent serving the Empress, anyway."
  MTS_defensible_churches:0 "Defensible Churches"
  MTS_defensible_churches_desc:0 "As the Adoratio spreads across the Peninsula, many churches will need to be constructed in order to properly serve the flocks of faithful. However, this also provides ample opportunity to provide bastions of Solarism, like this nation is, by making each church a fortress to itself in case of war. Even previously constructed churches will be brought to these standards, regardless of any tension it may cause."
  MTS_emplacements_of_fire:0 "Emplacements of Fire"
  MTS_emplacements_of_fire_desc:0 "With the first fortress churches constructed, we must build a ring of defense networks in their cities to prevent any and all invaders from utilizing air superiority or long ranged attacks to flush out the brave defenders. Entire batteries will be built so that the hail of lead from them will be so intense, that nothing will be able to get through!"
  MTS_medicine_is_luxury:0 "Medicine is a Luxury"
  MTS_medicine_is_luxury_desc:0 "In most nations, healthcare is seen as a basic right that creatures are entitled to merely for existing, but that is not only an expensive proposition, but a pointless one as well. What have the general citizenry ever done to deserve proper treatment? They only drain the system that should be used to serve those who fight for Order, which is exactly what we will now do."
  MTS_liberate_empire:0 "A Liberation of an Empire"
  MTS_liberate_empire_desc:0 "With our iron-forged society and soldiery, we stand at the brink of achieving our goals of liberating the Empire and restoring the Empress's fire to the world. In preparation, we must encourage the last steps in our plans to be done quickly, lest we lose the element of surprise and justice that will be required to defeat the heretics that have overtaken the Empire."
  MTS_sole_successor:0 "The Sole Successor"
  MTS_sole_successor_desc:0 "There may be others who try to claim the throne of the Empress for themselves, declaring that they are the true successor to the Empress's power, but they are nothing more than heretics or heathens. As we are the only ones with a true, uncorrupted priestesshood, and we have avoided the taint in the Empire itself, it is only natural that we are the only ones that can claim that right, and we must remind everypony of that."
  MTS_holy_among_heathens:0 "Holy Among Heathens"
  MTS_holy_among_heathens_desc:0 "As we are the sole light of the Empress left, we must be paragons of her light, might, and power. However, to achieve this, we must first completely rethink how we approach the role of the Inquisitionis. While it is perfectly reasonable to continue hunting heresy, they must also be beacons of the Empress to inspire everypony to fight for her, even if it means ignoring heresy, for the moment."
  MTS_grand_inquisition:0 "A Grand Inquisition"
  MTS_grand_inquisition_desc:0 "In lieu of consistent detection and destruction of heresy, we shall hold one, immense purge throughout [MTS.GetNameDef], so that we can bring it to almost nonexistent levels. Even within our own ranks, there is risk of compromise, which we must snuff out before it becomes a weakness that will prevent us from retaking the Empire for the Empress. We shall remain pure, or die trying!"
  MTS_unholy_texts:0 "Unholy Texts"
  MTS_unholy_texts_desc:0 "It has become clearer and clearer that the corruption that manifested itself within the Empire was not only due to heresy and lax teachers, but also because the texts that guide us have, at some point or another, become megaphones for sin and hedonism as well! In order to have a spotless Adoratio, we must completely unshackle ourselves from the past, and in so doing, ensure the Empress's will is carried out in its fullest."
  MTS_ascetic_torture:0 "Ascetic Torture"
  MTS_ascetic_torture_desc:0 "It is inconceiveable that some ponies believe that we must take easier measures on gaining information from heretics. Reports of what interrogations are like within [CER.GetNameDef] or [CLD.GetNameDef] are simply appalling, as they treat their prisoners with respect and dignity. If somepony has been accused as a heretic, there is no reason to be kind, for they will only be helpful when they are truly dead, which we will always hasten along."
  MTS_supportive_priestesshood:0 "A Supportive Priestesshood"
  MTS_supportive_priestesshood_desc:0 "The Adoratio has always been in the back seat of providing services to the faithful. Providing spiritual guidance, medical services to grievously injured, or other tasks have been their mode of operation for decades, and we see little reason for us to change the status quo, when they could only manage to improve our armies further from the rear."
  MTS_militant_priestesshood:0 "A Militant Priestesshood"
  MTS_militant_priestesshood_desc:0 "While the Adoratio has been used for decades to provide support and services to the faithful, that does not mean that they are only required to fill that role for the rest of time. There are many talented mages who otherwise see very little frontline service, and are quite capable of combat with the best of our soldiers. What reason is there to prevent them from joining, especially if it will aid our war against heresy?"
  MTS_new_cultus:0 "A New Solaris Cultus"
  MTS_new_cultus_desc:0 "With our new hoofhold in theology established, we can finally break free from the corrupt and vile Cultus that exists within the Empire's territory. No more will we pay homage to them, for they have forsaken their vows and will thusly only be treated as heretics. We are the Cultus now, and nothing will change that!"
  MTS_chastisement_of_fire:0 "Chastisement of Fire"
  MTS_chastisement_of_fire_desc:0 "These lands that we have taken are filled with nothing but heresy, rebellion, and hedonism. Millions of ponies believe that they are safe from any and all judgement, since they are not directly near any of the major cities. However, we have a number of captives from across the country, which we will use as a demonstration. They will fall in line, or they will burn in Tartarus forever!"
  MTS_string_up_separatists:0 "String up the Separatists"
  MTS_string_up_separatists_desc:0 "It is only fitting that the first to leave the Empire will be the first to perish by the Empire's hooves. The party members of COBSOC and their ilk will suffer for their transgressions against the Empress, beginning with those who were closest to Cobalt Hoof. Their dead bodies will serve as reminders that the Empress will always have her vengeance, and that nopony will be forgiven for their sins."
  MTS_all_martial_law:0 "Military Laws for All"
  MTS_all_martial_law_desc:0 "Having a distinction between civilian and martial laws is tedious and unneeded, since many of the judgements are the same for similar infractions. Eliminating all civilian laws will allow military tribunals speedier ability to punish lawbreakers, and also to further streamline what does and does not count as a crime. It will surely cut down on paperwork, if nothing else."
  MTS_deprive_nights_strength:0 "Deprive the Night of Its Strength"
  MTS_deprive_nights_strength_desc:0 "As there is a sizable population of thestrals that live in the Peninsula, we cannot possibly expect to completely and totally monitor them while they are able to continue their nocturnal heresies without retribution. Requiring that all of them live like the faithful, with waking hours between sunrise and sunset, will allow for easy control, and, hopefully simpler arrests for crimes they will no doubt commit."
  MTS_deface_state:0 "Deface the State"
  MTS_deface_state_desc:0 "In COBSOC, the face of the Party was the face of the state. In fact, they were one and the same. To provide a proper punishment for all of those left alive, we must humiliate the idea of a pony other than the Empress deserving of such devotion. We shall begin with Cobalt Hoof himself, and then move backwards until even all of MARESOC is mocked."
  MTS_blame_bats:0 "Blame the Bats"
  MTS_blame_bats_desc:0 "Although they are not some of the Empress's sheep, there are many within [MTS.GetNameDef] who despise the thestrals just as much as we do, if not more. It will be simple enough to blame them for any and all woes that have occurred since we have taken the Peninsula, so that we may kill two birds with one stone. There shall be less anger at us, and there shall be less thestrals for us to worry about, after a couple of good witch hunts."
  MTS_utilize_prisoners:0 "Utilize Prisoner Workforces"
  MTS_utilize_prisoners_desc:0 "Along with the captured from COBSOC, there are thousands upon thousands of prisoners that are already rotting in the prisons that they constructed. Although some of these ponies may see us as saviors, they will soon find that we are just as harsh a taskmaster, if not harsher, than COBSOC ever was. Together, they will expend the rest of their lives toiling for us and furthering the Empress's plans."
  MTS_night_of_thousand_cuts:0 "Night of a Thousand Cuts"
  MTS_night_of_thousand_cuts_desc:0 "The stage has been set for a proper culling of the thestrals. For too long, they have been thorns in the Empress's side and have continued to resist despite all our efforts to quash them and use them for her benefit. Our propaganda blaming thestrals for ponies' plights have paid off, and it will take only a spark to ignite the fire that will finally consume these creatures of darkness. All we need is a good ignitor."
  MTS_slimmed_populations:0 "Slimmed Populations"
  MTS_slimmed_populations_desc:0 "Across the Peninsula, there are many ponies who are not worth the effort to bring with us as we move forwad to victory. These shall simply be culled, so that we can make our moves complete in reclaiming this land for the Empress, and in so doing, lessen the burden on us and others, so that more focus can be placed on the Empress herself. After all, she is the giver of all life, and she can take it away just as easily."
  MTS_old_empress:0 "To an Old Empress"
  MTS_old_empress_desc:0 "No matter how dark it may get, we shall never renounce our love of Daybreaker nor our devotion to her. The Empire might have fallen, Daybreaker's physical body might have been destroyed, but we shall not stop, nor rest, until every inch of the Empire has been reclaimed, and every heretic infesting it is thrown into the Holy Flame, where their deeds shall be judged and their sins purified. For we are the true Empire, and nothing shall stop us!"
  MTS_renounce_sun_overlordship:0 "Renounce the Sun's Overlordship"
  MTS_renounce_sun_overlordship_desc:0 "While we have kept our ruse of loyalty, it is time we finally reveal our true colors. From this moment forth, we shall be directly opposed to those within [SLE.GetNameDef] and [SLE.GetLeader], and [SLE.GetLeader.GetSheHe] shall quake in fear as our armies march north to liberate the holy lands. May the Holy Flame forever keep us true to her!"
  MTS_usurping_mandate:0 "Usurping the Mandate"
  MTS_usurping_mandate_desc:0 "Through blood and sweat we have prevailed against the sinful fools that dared to corrupt the Empire as they did. However, there is only so much we can do to restore the glory of the Empire under Daybreaker, and it is with a heavy heart that we will have to lead in her place, which is truly an untenable task."
  MTS_soft_and_complacent:0 "Soft and Complacent"
  MTS_soft_and_complacent_desc:0 "The Solaris Adoratio was meant to be the backbone of the Solaris Cultus, supporting the Empress in every way, showing in the Scriptures how her words gave us meaning, and how they were nothing but truth and justice. Yet through the money they received in tithes, they grew blind and lazy, allowing unorthodoxy and heresy fester wherever it wished. They must be cleansed for the Empire to heal properly."
  MTS_immortal_blight:0 "An Immortal Blight"
  MTS_immortal_blight_desc:0 "No matter what we do, there will always be heresies. It is a fact of life. Where there are ponies, there will always be the degenerate and the renegade that wish to spread sin, sew devastation, and bring about the will of Chaos. Since we have stationed ourselves in the Empire's territory, heresy discoveries by the Inquisitionis have skyrocketed, yet little is ever found when they are raided. We must be on our guard."
  MTS_overweight_and_overdue:0 "Overweight and Overdue"
  MTS_overweight_and_overdue_desc:0 "Although a number of inquisitors from the Solaris Inquisitionis are innocent and dedicated to suppressing and destroying heresy wherever it appears, that does clearly not apply to the greater Inquisitionis as a whole. They let the sin fester and metastasize within the Empire, and they sat by as they grew fat off its intoxicating fruit. We shall remind them of their duty with the Holy Flame."
  MTS_crimes_against_faith:0 "Crimes against Faith"
  MTS_crimes_against_faith_desc:0 "Of the many priestesses that fell to sin in the Empire, some are more influential than others, especially those that spent their time within Sanctum Solar itself. Seen as paragons of the Empress, their teaching and their examples allowed the spread of more opulent and hedonistic thought to infect the society of the Empire at large. It is time that their sin be brought to justice, and melted off with the Flame."
  MTS_strip_churches_of_power:0 "Strip the Churches of Power"
  MTS_strip_churches_of_power_desc:0 "One way in which the corrupted Adoratio brainwashed the populace was through using the tithe money they received to decorate their churches to absurdity. The Empress cares not about how objectively beautiful the interior of a place of worship is, when the hearts are focused on it rather than her! These beacons of filth must be stripped of all that makes them beautiful for their members' own good."
  MTS_intangible_links:0 "Intangible Links"
  MTS_intangible_links_desc:0 "For weeks, attacks from clearly organized heretic cells have battered our troops and supplies, but there is no clear pattern to their raids, despite their obviously planned and coordinated nature. Of the inquisitors that are loyal and faithful to us, we will use them to infiltrate and scout, to hopefully find one of these cells and learn their intent, and, more importantly, who is their leader."
  MTS_apocryphal_made_vulgar:0 "Apocryphal made Vulgar"
  MTS_apocryphal_made_vulgar_desc:0 "Deep within the Imperial Palace, once guarded by inquisitors and praetorians alike, the Imperial Archives lay as examples of the arrogance and pride of the Inquisitionis and Adoratio. Although that very thought is distasteful, the greater problem is that the many scrolls and tomes these archives hold are not available to all! Secrets only imply heresy!"
  MTS_weak_and_incapable:0 "Weak and Intangible"
  MTS_weak_and_incapable_desc:0 "As the number of inquisitors that have been captured have grown, we have seen a recurring pattern. They simply do not have the desire nor the mental fortitude to remain committed to the Empress's every command, and cleanse heresy wherever it could potentially spring up. Therefore, we must use them as examples: anypony weak like these is not fit to serve the Empress, and will be judged like them. As failures."
  MTS_keep_status_quo:0 "Keep the Status Quo"
  MTS_keep_status_quo_desc:0 "As much as we would completely eradicate all those that cling to the corrupt, old ways of the Adoratio, if we push much more, it is likely that we will face an open revolt from those who still who are resistant. Sunset Shimmer has been imprisoned since we took Sanctum Solar, and she appears to be outside the plot of the Adoratio. Keeping her as its head will only ingratiate ourselves with our citizens."
  MTS_replace_corrupt_priestesses:0 "Replace Corrupt Priestesses"
  MTS_replace_corrupt_priestesses_desc:0 "With the last purges of the Adoratio complete, there is a large vacuum that must be filled to maintain proper levels of theological instruction and correction. Already all of the priestesses that came with us when we left the Empire have taken up their mantle, but there is one role, that of High Mage, that must be filled, and there is only one pony that Scorched knows that can fill it..."
  MTS_cauterizing_evidence:0 "Cauterizing the Evidence"
  MTS_cauterizing_evidence_desc:0 "If we are to ever eliminate heresy within our borders for good, we must take extreme measures to extract information. The Inquisitionis may be brutal in its tactics of torture, but they are still not getting results like we had hoped. Therefore, with the few remaining rebels we have, Scorched Earth will take the matter personally upon him, and finally find information on who is leading this strangely organized heresy."
  MTS_remove_abomination:0 "Remove the Abomination"
  MTS_remove_abomination_desc:0 "For years, the Inquisitionis was led by not a pony, but a force of nature, untamable even by the Empress herself. Lady Inquisitor Quasar Pulse is known for her excessive sadism and rabid commitment to removing all heresy. While normally not a problem, her magical prowess as a gravity-manipulating gravitar, is. All it will take is one slip and she could be at our throats. It is best to put her down, for the good of all."
  MTS_reinstate_gravitar:0 "Reinstate the Gravitar"
  MTS_reinstate_gravitar_desc:0 "Quasar Pulse has been the Lady Inquisitor of the Inquisitionis for years, and she has served almost sycophantically to ensure that heresy has been cleansed wherever it is discovered. Currently, she is held in isolation, where her gravity magic can be neutralized, but she has promised that all of us 'heretics' will be destroyed. However, she could see reason, if Scorced can convince her of our righteous path..."

  MTS_theology_of_nothing_desc:0 "As far back as can be recalled by Scorched Earth or anypony else with him, the Adoratio promised that there would be blessing for those that followed the Empress's wishes, however, that vow has changed over time to de-emphasize the spiritual, which is the only reward needed, to instead focus on the material. It is time to re-focus on the truth of Daybreaker, no matter how unliked it may be."
  MTS_uncovering_secrets:0 "Uncovering Secrets"
  MTS_uncovering_secrets_desc:0 "After excessive digging through hunches and clues left by the heretics in their attacks, we have finally pinpointed who must be leading them: the Solaris Speculatores, which was the former intelligence wing of the Solaris Cultus. Their entire organization disappeared after our conquest, and it appears they've gone rogue. There is a likely meeting place in the next few days, and we would be wise to... interrupt it."
  MTS_keeping_few_shadows:0 "Keeping a Few Shadows"
  MTS_keeping_few_shadows_desc:0 "Through absurd amounts of research and investigation, it has been determined that the most likely group that is behind the organization of the heretics would be the Solaris Speculatores, the intelligence wing of the Solaris Cultus. Recently a few coded messages to Scorched have requested he meet with the sender privately. It is illogical, but, it appears they want to talk. It is best to not keep them waiting."
  MTS_only_empress:0 "Only the Empress"
  MTS_only_empress_desc:0 "Many have forgotten their first pledge, to serve the Empress without fail, as weapons for her to use to cleanse and protect Equus. They have placed their trust in themselves, their wealth, their material possessions, or others, yet not in her. Enforcing that the Empress be the focal point of all will get them back on track, or die in their failure."
  MTS_faithful_to_end:0 "Faithful to the End"
  MTS_faithful_to_end_desc:0 "Through the reinforcement from the newly restored Adoratio, our citizens are beginning to fall in line. If they do not, then they are quickly chastened with the Holy Flame. Everypony, if they know what is good for their eternal soul, will stand against any and all that oppose the Empress's plan of restoring Equus. Our enemies will not know peace while the Adoratio still serves."
  MTS_dictate_of_sun:0 "Dictate of the Sun"
  MTS_dictate_of_sun_desc:0 "It is clear that none that could normally fill the vacuum left by the Empress is capable of filling the role which she provided. While Scorched Earth is only one pony, he has led [MTS.GetNameDef] to greatness, to power, and to piety. There is only one who is worthy of taking the mantle of the Empress, and it is him alone."
  MTS_zealous_to_last:0 "Zealous to the Last"
  MTS_zealous_to_last_desc:0 "Our soldiers have been drilled until they will break no further, for to surrender, to accept the easy, simple way out, is to accept death of the soul.

  MTS_warriors_mistake_desc:0 "Although the General's enthusiasm for his beliefs led to rapid progress, those developments are already showing their inherrent weaknesses as crime rates have grown and poverty is still rampant. Unlike what he says, having less doesn't automatically make ponies focus on Daybreaker, and showoing him his mistakes could bring him around strongly to Warm Night's position."
  MTS_faithfuls_folly:0 "The Faithful's Folly"
  MTS_faithfuls_folly_desc:0 "It is a common interpretation of the Inquisitionis's mission of serving and protecting Daybreaker that it requires harsh and exacting laws and punishment, but that is not the only interpretation. To stay dogmatic, when there is just as much support for other views is foolish. Convincing Luminous Blade of such would provide Warm Night some sway with the Inquisitionis, if she succeeds."
  MTS_curious_curios:0 "Curious Curios"
  MTS_curious_curios_desc:0 "New Horseleans society is starkly different from that within the Solar Empire, and has proven to be a shocking exposure to many of the Adoratio and Inquisitionis, who have never ventured outside of its borders. This has only piqued the curiosity of Warm Night, who has always searched for a way to draw more ponies to Daybreaker. Perhaps there is something that can be learned from COBSOC's social ideals?"
  MTS_troubles_of_cult:0 "Troubles of the Cult"
  MTS_troubles_of_cult_desc:0 "To most ponies, the whole Solaris Cultus appears united and whole, with little division aside from when somepony goes rogue and is dealt with. However, like any large organization, there are multiple moving cogs and ambitions that must be checked. Rumblings of unrest in the Inquisitionis against Warm Night have been growing for weeks, and she must be careful, lest the inquisitors oust her for hetreodox behavior."
  MTS_general_conspiracy:0 "The General Conspiracy"
  MTS_general_conspiracy_desc:0 "To say that the transition from General Earth to Warm Night was a popular decision would be lying. The other officers that broke off with General Earth have voiced their displeasure the moment General Earth resigned from leadership of [MTS.GetNameDef]. They have not outright defied her, but it would not take much for them to look the other way if somepony were to try something against her..."
  MTS_hitting_books:0 "Hitting the Books"
  MTS_hitting_books_desc:0 "An important aspect of any society, let alone Imperial society, is a strong grasp of a multitude of concepts that keep a citizen a productive servant of the Empress. Not only has standard Imperial education been lacking, but New Horseleans has had education problems supposedly for years. Mixing our teachings with theirs should provide the bridge needed to rebuild society."
  MTS_fine_stagnation:0 "Stagnation at Its Finest"
  MTS_fine_stagnation_desc:0 "Unsurprisingly, when all motivation for work has been destroyed through "lean" concepts or simply not prioritizing repair work, productivity plummets. [MTS.GetNameDef] is just barely continuing to function and it is debatable if it could have survived under Scorched Earth. Funding reconstruction efforts will be expensive, but will pay off with much more faithful citizens in the end."
  MTS_society_of_friends:0 "A Society of Friends"
  MTS_society_of_friends_desc:0 "Although it is not the same community that sisters in Daybreaker experience, some of the ideals behind COBSOC's founding ideology did try to form stronger relationships between ponies and support each other in times of trouble. Those are concepts from which the Cultus has drifted away over the years. Perhaps it's time to encourage this behavior again."
  MTS_exemplars_of_compassion:0 "Exemplars of Compassion"
  MTS_exemplars_of_compassion_desc:0 "A priestesses duty, among other things, is to care for the flock of Daybreaker, and keep them following after her. However, that message has been eroded over time as the Inquisitionis has become dominant within the Empire, and its tenets of eradicating heresy overriding the mission of the Adoratio. This should not be, and the sisterhood in [MTS.GetNameDef] should be a beacon of Daybreaker's love to all."
  MTS_encourage_liberal_arts:0 "Encourage Liberal Arts"
  MTS_encourage_liberal_arts_desc:0 "There seems to be an illogical fear of self-expression and creativity within the Empire itself, as the Inquisitionis has petitioned that anything not commissioned by them to potentially be a way for heresy to arise by encouraging unorthodox thoughts. But that is preposterous. Who has ever begun to question Daybreaker's divinity when they see a unique perspective of her glory?"
  MTS_paid_church_work:0 "Paid Church Work"
  MTS_paid_church_work_desc:0 "As we establish the proper network of Adoratio churches to provide the social network that ponies require, and to keep them under a careful eye for guidance and direction, we should also ensure that there are jobs for the most at risk of falling into complete destitution. The war has left many without home or food, and even menial work for a small share of food or wealth will ingratiate ourselves with our citizens."
  MTS_clergy_of_sympathy:0 "Clergy of Sympathy"
  MTS_clergy_of_sympathy_desc:0 "The sisters of the Adoratio are obscenely blessed compared to those that have recently become our charges. Within the Empire, we are only meant to shepherd, but even the poorest there are rich compared to some of the destitute that live within our borders. Of the wealth that we have from our tithes, we must give back to the community, much like some Markists, if we are to ever win over the hearts of the lost souls here."
  MTS_new_deity:0 "The New Deity"
  MTS_new_deity_desc:0 "It has been little secret that Priestess Warm Night is not the emotionless leader that Scorched Earth was, but it has been a small wonder how some of the tactics of the Adoratio have been reworked. According to her, revelation from Daybreaker has been given to her, that a new path should be forged, to show how we can live in peace, and guide all to be under her. Some would call this heresy, others... sanity."
  MTS_church_duty_expansion:0 "Expansion of Church Duties"
  MTS_church_duty_expansion_desc:0 "As part of the service that the priestesses play to the citizenry, they must be prepared to deal with all manner of disturbed ponies, who have been affected by the aftermath of the conquests of this region. Although they may be suffering, and they may decry Daybreaker the hardest, by leading through example, we can hopefully turn them into the brightest beacons for the Empress instead."
  MTS_backward_mistake:0 "Mistake of the Backward"
  MTS_backward_mistake_desc:0 "Through a couple of faithful inquisitors, word has reached us that Archmage Pinpoint, one of the most zealous inquisitors who joined Scorched Earth's invasion, has been planning to arrest Warm Night on charges of heresy. If it were not for these brave souls, her intent would have been fulfilled, but she now lies in custody. It is only a matter of how Warm Night would like to deal with it that remains."
  MTS_zealots_of_mercy:0 "Zealots of Mercy"
  MTS_zealots_of_mercy_desc:0 "The Militarium is one of the foundations of our nations, but it has been trained in orthodox tactics for decades, which has led to inflexible and outdated thinking among the general staff. We must see ourselves as guides for ponies' liberation into life under the Empress, and the blessings that she provides. To that end, a softer touch might be needed at times."
  MTS_span_gap:0 "Span the Gap"
  MTS_span_gap_desc:0 "Just because some in the general staff attempted to end Warm Night's rule, doesn't mean that they must be treated the same way. They are misguided, and perhaps speaking with them and clearing the air will be a strong start to a more united nation."
  MTS_standing_firm:0 "Standing Firm on Faith"
  MTS_standing_firm_desc:0 "The attempt to down Warm Night further proves that the most extreme elements of Militem Solar needed to be tempered. Although these generals have given faithful service for years, it does not mean that they cannot fall astray and go against the Empress's will. There are very clear laws regarding that, even if they are unpleasant at times, and they must be enforced."
  MTS_reconciling_differences:0 "Reconciling Differences"
  MTS_reconciling_differences_desc:0 "Although the orthodox among the general staff may remain a constant, nagging thorn, they have at least agreed to follow Warm Night, given that she has promised that the Empress will guide her, and that she will not go against Daybreaker's word. This was furthered by promising to listen to their concerns about her soft hoof, and implementing further remedies for it. We shall see if it has the effect desired."
  MTS_loyalty_to_new_sun:0 "Loyalty to the New Sun"
  MTS_loyalty_to_new_sun_desc:0 "From Sabre Rattle's attempted coup, it is clear that there is a flaw in the training of officers within [MTS.GetNameDef], which could lead to further problems as we replace those that almost ended Warm Night's rule. There are no shortage of excited ponies under us, though, that could serve within the armed forces. It will just require a bit of encouraging and proper education to see done."
  MTS_paramount_salvation:0 "Paramount Salvation"
  MTS_paramount_salvation_desc:0 "Although there may be differences, the mission of all ponies within [MTS.GetNameDef] is the same: We wish to see that the South-East is restored to be one with the Empress, and everypony must bow the knee to her. We must not and will not forget that, lest we allow petty squabbles to drive us apart again."
  MTS_solarist_revolution:0 "Protection for the Solarist Revolution"
  MTS_solarist_revolution_desc:0 "Worshiping the God-Empress is more than simply following a religion. It is a whole way of life, different in many ways from the lives that ponies led while living under COBSOC. Ours is a worthwhile cause, though, and we must further encourage our soldiers that we work to free all of those that remain on the peninsula, so that they may be free to remain under the Empress, and forever praise her name!"
  MTS_solar_markism:0 "Solar Markism"
  MTS_solar_markism_desc:0 "Solarism is not just a religion, it is an entire way of life and process of thought. Therefore, although some of the narrow-minded in the Inquisitionis position the Empire as opposed to the nature of various economic systems, there is little actual conflict. The ponies of the South-East have much to share in how they lived, and the schools and universities will be the perfect grounds for integrating it into a new, better worldview."
  MTS_protect_sun:0 "Protection of the Sun"
  MTS_protect_sun_desc:0 "The heat of the South-East dissuades many from even venturing into it, but we, as the Empress's loyal ponies, have little fear of the blistering temperatures that are commonplace. With our mission of evangelisim of the entire peninsula, we are blessed by the Empress's favor to walk in the figurative sauna without worries."
  MTS_craftsponies_in_metal:0 "Craftsponies in Metal"
  MTS_craftsponies_in_metal_desc:0 "There is an abundance of iron and coal within our lands, and uncountable numbers of unemployed that are on the brink of starvation. To forge steel and iron requires relatively little knowledge, as with mining it, and in orderr to keep the most vulnerable from falling prey to baser instincts, it may be useful to provide them at least temporary employment aiding our industry."
  MTS_blessing_local_industries:0 "Blessing Local Industries"
  MTS_blessing_local_industries_desc:0 "As the entire South-East is a large peninsula, with thousands of kilometers of coast, fisheries are a staple in practically every settlement. However, with both COBSOC's corruption and the conquest by Scorched Earth, those within our borders have slowly been collapsing, and if they disappear, they will leave a hole that cannot be filled. Some subsidies should prevent this, though."
  MTS_resettling_diaspora:0 "Resttling the Diaspora"
  MTS_resettling_diaspora_desc:0 "In the wake of Scorched Earth's conquest of the territory we now control, dozens of smaller settlements were razed or otherwise left uninhabitable by the passing armies of both sides. There are tens of thousands of ponies that have been left without house and home, forced to struggle on the streets. For a small investment, though, we can house them and further ingratiate ourselves with the populace."
  MTS_maintaining_integrity:0 "Maintaining Pony Integrity"
  MTS_maintaining_integrity_desc:0 "Although the Adoratio sometimes preaches otherwise, and the Inquisitionis follows suit, every pony is a wonderful creation of the God-Empress. While many have gone astray, and must be dealt with later, it is clear from how some of the Markists act that we must treat everypony with a bit more grace, and otherwise ensure they have a small level of dignity in their lives."
  MTS_minimum_mandate:0 "A Mandated Minimum"
  MTS_minimum_mandate_desc:0 "A controversial plan from COBSOC, which had been trialed in a few regions, was the concept of paying ponies a basic level of money, so they could merely survive. Although this is even less popular among the generals, Scorched Earth, and the Cultus, there is some merit to the idea. It may be expensive, but if ponies could believe that the money is a blessing from Daybreaker, they would be more willing to follow her. It could eventually be revoked in the wake of a job, though."
  MTS_raise_poverty_ceiling:0 "Raise the Poverty Ceiling"
  MTS_raise_poverty_ceiling_desc:0 "Our destitute must be ensured that they will have some livelihood from which they can survive, even if it's meagre. There are many others that have a figurative abundance, from which they could provide to those that suffer the most, and we can retool some of our industry to support only the neediest. Eventually, we should claim that our beggars are the richest in all of Equus, affording more and better than the average citizen in the Empire."
  MTS_evangelize_southeast:0 "Evangelize the South-East"
  MTS_evangelize_southeast_desc:0 "Although some decisions were not popular, Warm Night has stabilized our position within the peninsula, and we are now poised to liberate and bring the light of the Empress to the rest of the South-East. Soon, everypony will be free to follow the Empress, or they will be corrected in their error until they do!"
  ###Post-War###
  MTS_liberated_to_daybreaker:0 "Liberated to Daybreaker"
  MTS_liberated_to_daybreaker_desc:0 "With the complete routing of our remaining foes within the Peninsula, we can finally celebrate that the lingering hoof of COBSOC and Cobalt Hoof has finally been eradicated. The ponies within our lands are now freer than they ever were under the old regime, and we can all praise our Empress for guiding our hooves to victory!"
  MTS_heroes_of_southeast:0 "Heroes of the South-East"
  MTS_heroes_of_southeast_desc:0 "Through blood, sweat, and tears, the brave souls that fought for us have laid down their lives in service to the Empress, and should be recognized as such. While Priestess Night has expressed her desire not to glorify the lives lost, we must do something to honor those who have fallen, and learn from those that survived."
  MTS_resolving_logistical_nightmares:0 "Resolving the Logistical Nightmares"
  MTS_resolving_logistical_nightmares_desc:0 "The South-Eastern Peninsula was always at a disadvantage compared to the heartlands of the Empire, but the decades of corruption and oppression by Cobalt Hoof has only made the situation worse. It is a marvel that the military of [BAL.GetNameDef] functioned at all, given the complete lack of an organized logistical network. This only necessitates that we innovate our supply chain sooner, rather than later."
  MTS_warfare_in_practice:0 "Warfare in Practice"
  MTS_warfare_in_practice_desc:0 "Although we have a core of dedicated and experienced staffponies within the Militem who can train our troops, there is simply such a high ratio between them and the volunteers and conscripts of the peninsula that it is hard to properly instruct them. Although the war was not pleasant, we have far more veterans now than we did even a year ago, who can help with educating and innovating our doctrines to the fullest."
  MTS_for_long_haul:0 "For the Long Haul"
  MTS_for_long_haul_desc:0 "As part of our logistical restructuring, it is a good a time as any to investigate areas that we might be able to further bolster and utilize to the greatest extent in a network of roadways and supply lines, to provide as much supplies as possible to our troops. If they are able to hold practically anywhere, then we can ensure that every inch of ground is fought over with minimal losses for us, and maximal for the enemy."
  MTS_going_native:0 "Going Native"
  MTS_going_native_desc:0 "Although many of COBSOC and Cobalt Hoof's practices in warfare were reprehensible, there was a certain logic behind them. The South-East is a dangerous place, and ruthlessness and a smidgen of detachment may be required in order to have enough forces to defend against any potential invaders. While there are proven tactics more effective than a pony wave, with the numbers we shall have, is it so bad if we follow suit?"
  MTS_stand_firm_for_daybreaker:0 "Stand Firm on Daybreaker's Promises"
  MTS_stand_firm_for_daybreaker_desc:0 "While it may seem fruitless at times to resist against those who outnumber us or those who have better weaponry than us, we must not let the hope that our Empress provides falter. To every faithful pony to her, she promises that she will strengthen them, as ensured by Priestess Night, and that one day all will be rewarded for their diligence. Every soldier must remember this, or we will all fall back into oppression."
  MTS_local_influence:0 "Local Influence"
  MTS_local_influence_desc:0 "During the war that COBSOC waged for independence, the thestrals of the central peninsula aligned themselves with assurances they would be left alone afterward. COBSOC only kept part of that promise. However, some thestrals joined the military of [BAL.GetNameDef], and were apparently useful trainers. There have been suggestions before of integrating them, but it seems that it will be a cold day in Tartarus before that happens."
  MTS_sacrifices_for_mercy:0 "Sacrifices for Daybreaker's Mercy"
  MTS_sacrifices_for_mercy_desc:0 "As the clarity of Cobalt Hoof's tactics to maintain military presence within the peninsula have become clearer, it is obvious that some soldiers will need further encouragement, as they realize they are little more than numbers on a paper. Thankfully, the Empress has already provided that information. All who die in her service are promised honor and glory in the afterlife, and this will be drilled further into their training, to encourage true acts of bravery."
  MTS_guardians_of_sun:0 "Guardians of the Sun"
  MTS_guardians_of_sun_desc:0 "Our military is one of a truly holy mission. Everypony in the peninsula must come to understand that they must guard their way of life against those who would brand us heretics or fools. We are the blessed of Daybreaker, and we will protect her provisions with our lives, lest all that Priestess Night fought for be lost, forever."
  MTS_unified_spirit:0 "A Unified Spirit"
  MTS_unified_spirit_desc:0 "The old way of the peninsula only led to heartbreak and oppression, yet there are still many of those whom we liberated who hold to Cobalt Hoof's vile ideology. The Peninsula is in ruins, and ponies are divided. Yet, through some of these prisoners' labor, we can work at rebuilding back, stronger and more content, all through some small sacrifices on their part."
  MTS_workshops_of_healing:0 "Workshops of Healing"
  MTS_workshops_of_healing_desc:0 "Many were left destitute by the conquests of the South-East, and some were driven further into poverty by it. COBSOC, although it spouted some ideals, did little to actually help their citizens, however, the scars of their propaganda lies deep. Providing for all, though, is the best way to break down these barriers, and constructing more factories for goods faster, will aid in that department."
  MTS_grand_designs:0 "Grand Designs"
  MTS_grand_designs_desc:0 "The Peninsula is ripe for various developments that will aid all who live within the region. Although some of these might go against the run of the mill for the South-East, the unifying drive behind it all will bring us all closer together, and eventually raise the bar for everypony's walk in life."
  MTS_reality_of_life:0 "Reality of Life"
  MTS_reality_of_life_desc:0 "Although we have striven to give everypony a chance at living a peaceful life, it would be foolish to believe that there are not threats to our existence. Other Solarists would decry us heretics, the changelings wish to finish the Great War, and there are always dangers from the north in Stalliongrad or across the sea. It is unfortunate, but we must use some of our time for war, whether we want to or not."
  MTS_stimulate_growth:0 "Stimulate Growth"
  MTS_stimulate_growth_desc:0 "Much has already been done to aid our citizens and move them toward a better life than they had only a few years before, but there is still much more that we can do for them. As there are some reserve funds left in the Adoratio's own coffers, it may be worthwhile to spend it wisely, and further accelerate our ponies' quality of life."
  MTS_expand_living_blocs:0 "Expand the Living Blocs"
  MTS_expand_living_blocs_desc:0 "The South-East is one of the most populous regions of Equus, with birth rates spurgeoned by low education and access to easy, if not amazing medical care. It has led to a generation of homeless, that were made destitute by lack of employment, and lack of housing. Subsidizing development will solve both of those issues for our largest cities."
  MTS_nexus_of_defense:0 "Nexus of Defense"
  MTS_nexus_of_defense_desc:0 "As our nation prospers, we must ensure that we have a central location for our general staff to meet in. Although Scorched Earth has at times still been resistant to the changes Warm Night has led, he has proposed a fortified, technologically advanced center, from which the general staff could effectively coordinate. We would be on par with nations much larger, and provide a serious deterrent for any invasion."
  MTS_debtors_labor:0 "A Debtor's Labor"
  MTS_debtors_labor_desc:0 "There are some within [MTS.GetNameDef] that have proven that they are hostile to our economic plans. They could be employers, employees, soldiers, educators, or any other manner of profession. While Priestess Night has given them more chances than they deserve, they will never bow fully to the Empress, and we should leave them where they cannot harm others. At least they will live the rest of their lives, unlike in the Empire."
  MTS_lifes_wages:0 "Life's Wages"
  MTS_lifes_wages_desc:0 "It is everypony's duty to labor as hard as they can for the Empress. We are the only nation on Equus that has ensured that everypony experiences her mercy, and they must repay that with cheerful toiling without complaining. This is not to say they will be used as chattel, but to earn their survival, they must strive for it."
  MTS_hyperscaled_worship:0 "Hyper-Scaled Worship"
  MTS_hyperscaled_worship_desc:0 "As the central beacon of the South-East, it is only natural that New Baltimare be used as the nexus for worship on the peninsula. As a way to encourage further investment into the local economy, a grand project will be announced, rivaling the holy Cathedral of the Sun in Sanctum Solar itself!"
  MTS_fair_economies:0 "Fair Economies"
  MTS_fair_economies_desc:0 "To remain without challenge is to become stagnant, and this is true in personal lives as it is for nations and for businesses. Under COBSOC, the economy was tightly controlled, and businesses and industries struggled to remain relevant to Equus. By mandating certain sectors to have at least some open regulations and anti-monopoly laws, we can hopefully encourage businesses to innovate, without costing ponies jobs, compared to the other, capitalistic extreme."
  MTS_will_of_soul:0 "Will of the Soul"
  MTS_will_of_soul_desc:0 "A pony is more than flesh and bones, brains and neurons. All of us are gifted a spirit, which is the true reflection of the Empress, and that must be cherished and nurtured at any cost. Although we are a middling power, we shall fight for our liberation and prosperity, both in our lands as we eradicate poverty, and externally, to save our way of life, so that future generations my praise the Empress all the more!"
  MTS_goddess_of_light_and_love:0 "Goddess of Light and Love"
  MTS_goddess_of_light_and_love_desc:0 "The misguided ponies within the South-East have been told for years that the God-Empress is a monster, who will murder them at the soonest chance for the slightest misstep. While it is true that she is just, she also provides mercy and grace to those who submit to her, and we must proclaim this far and wide, so that all may follow her and know her embrace."
  MTS_heating_frigid:0 "Heating the Frigid"
  MTS_heating_frigid_desc:0 "With the annexation of the rest of the peninsula, our previous efforts of providing for the destitute are coming up short. As our resources are stretched thin, it is clear that we must increase what we can provide to them, no matter how painful. Those that are barely holding onto their homes are critical to keep afloat, and shoring up some of their monthly costs will improve the lives of everypony."
  MTS_final_translations:0 "Perfected Translations"
  MTS_final_translations_desc:0 "Most of the scriptures of the Solaris Cultus are taken from centuries' old manuscripts, written in Old Ponish. Although the common pony can have their own copies, they must still know the language, and also be properly led by priestesses in theological study. As everypony should know the wonderful news of the Empress's embrace, we should make our own vulgate. With maybe a few clarifications here and there."
  MTS_equality_in_empress:0 "Equality in the Empress"
  MTS_equality_in_empress_desc:0 "The ideals of Markism and its offshoots is to ensure that everypony has equality in life, but because of their godless roots, the result is always corrupted in some way. What they did not realize is that everypony is equal under the Empress. We are all her servants. We all labor to extend her mercy to others, and in that way, we all become one and truly free. To hide this truth would horrible, and we must spread it far and wide!"
  MTS_breaking_cycle:0 "Breaking the Cycle"
  MTS_breaking_cycle_desc:0 "Since the earliest days of the Cultus, before the Empress ascended, everypony who served in it pledged their lives to her. They would be faithful to her, solely dedicated to her. However, when she arrived, some began to take this doctrine further, denying our servants some of the joys of life that she provides. Today, ending the practice of celibacy will allow all our faithful priestesses to finally pursue whom they want, and further raise families into the Empress's embrace."
  MTS_continuing_tradition:0 "Continuing Tradition"
  MTS_continuing_tradition_desc:0 "Although outsiders may frown upon some of the Cultus's tenets and demands of its servants, they are of little consequence to us. The pledges of celibacy, and dedicating oneself solely to the Empress assist in keeping the Cultus pure, so that bloodlines may not spring up that gain favor within her order. A few may grumble, but we must keep ourselves focused on she who is of greater importance: Daybreaker."
  MTS_open_churches:0 "Open Up the Churches"
  MTS_open_churches_desc:0 "In the wake of the war, we have many buildings dedicated to the faithful that are left empty when worship services are not occurring. These are more than enough to house tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of ponies, and there is little reason why we cannot show the love of the Empress by keeping them open for shelter and food. Free evangelism is a bonus, too."
  MTS_education_of_truth:0 "Education of Truth"
  MTS_education_of_truth_desc:0 "There are those that claim that what we preach and teach is a twisted amalgam of both COBSOC and Solarism. While it is true that our eyes have been opened to the truth that Markism has always tried to espouse, we have not sacrificed our ideals. Any argument to the contrary will be quickly corrected, forever."
  MTS_unexpected_proposal:0 "An Unexpected Proposal"
  MTS_unexpected_proposal_desc:0 "Scorched Earth has always been a rather stoic stallion, driven by his beliefs in an ascetic, militaristic lifestyle. However, that demeanor has been seen to be breaking, although it is not understood why. Nothing could sway him from his course, could it?"
  MTS_wisdom_of_economic_affairs:0 "Wisdom of Economic Affairs"
  MTS_wisdom_of_economic_affairs_desc:0 "In order for there to be a strong and stable society, there must be a solid base on which it may be built. Like in every other nation, if that is not the economy, then eventually the entire thing will collapse. However, to let ambition run amok would be hazardous, therefore, a council which will decide upon matters and advise Priestess Night will lead to a much more stable result."
  MTS_illuminating_errors:0 "Illuminating the Errors"
  MTS_illuminating_errors_desc:0 "The Solaris Inquisitionis is filled with our sisters in the Empress, but their doctrines have been hardened and all independent thought has been quashed, in a drive to eradicate heresy wherever they believe it to the found. The Adoratio, and Warm Night, have not been subject to such futility, and it is our duty to awaken them to the truth, no matter how much it hurts us or them."
  MTS_traitors_punishment:0 "A Traitor's Punishment"
  MTS_traitors_punishment_desc:0 "There are both open and close-minded inquisitors within the Inquisitionis, and unfortunately it is difficult to discern at times which is which. Although we have ordered, with the weight of the Empress's decrees behind us, that they stand down and be grilled, some have gone rogue and declared us heretics. They will only serve to destabilize us, and although they are our sisters, they must follow other traitors' fate to show that we favor nopony. May the Empress forgive us all."
  MTS_obsolete_requirements:0 "Obsolete Job Requirements"
  MTS_obsolete_requirements_desc:0 "The concept of the inquisitor is from a time when orthodoxy had to be enforced through harsh measures and an iron hoof, but within our lands, we encourage everypony to follow Daybreaker and worship her, through showing her love and kindness to those who are faithful. The inquisitor is no longer needed. Absorbing them may take time, but they will soon be like any other priestess, like us."
  MTS_servants_of_new_sun:0 "Servants of the New Sun"
  MTS_servants_of_new_sun_desc:0 "It is clear that ponies on both sides of the issue have misinterpreted Daybreaker's mission. She is the God-Empress, but she is not one to harm her ponies unnecessiarily. Misguided ponies will be corrected, and eventually left to their fates if they refuse, but in that time, we must show everypony her grace. It is the only way that we shall save all our souls."
  MTS_laying_firm_hoof:0 "Laying a Firm Hoof"
  MTS_laying_firm_hoof_desc:0 "Although we fought this bloody war to free and rescue all those that were chafing under the oppression of COBSOC's remnants, that does not mean that we are welcomed everywhere, nor that we should naively think we are untouchable. The South-East is a testament to the power of ponies working together, and we would be wise to provide strict guidelines that will be adherred to, so that all may live in safety."
  MTS_correct_children:0 "Corrections for Children"
  MTS_correct_children_desc:0 "We respect that our ways will not be liked at first, and likewise, we will not immediately punish those who wish to express their distaste. However, there comes a time when repeated insubordination should be dealt with, and as time drags on and hundreds of thousands resist or protest our rule, we must institute corrections somewhere. We cannot allow them to destabilize us, after all."
  MTS_stage_counterprotests:0 "Stage Counterprotests"
  MTS_stage_counterprotests_desc:0 "There is the impression that Priestess Night is an unpopular, autocratic theocrat, who wishes nothing more than to see all the supposed progress that Cobalt Hoof, Lucky Star, Tranquil Serenade, or other ponies of influence in their cliques had accomplished. That is far from the case, as it is skewed by the disgruntled. There are throngs of those who praise the Empress for our liberation. We should encourage some to speak up."

  MTS_debate_levelheaded_desc:0 "In the midst of the larger uproar against control from Warm Night, there are a few points that those who have been identified as the leaders of these protests and riots have. These messages have been lost in the muddling influence of radical voices, but that doesn't mean that Priestess Night cannot meet with those who have grievances, and steer them onto the path of enlightenment."
  MTS_withdraw_social_programs:0 "Withdraw Social Programs"
  MTS_withdraw_social_programs_desc:0 "The promise was there. Everypony who was liberated would have had the opportunity to live like those in the old lands of Equestria, before the Empress ascended, but not everypony apparently has wanted them. That is the only conclusion that can be drawn from the cacophony of voices claiming that our government is illegitimate. For them to learn, consequences must be enacted, starting with the social fabric they seem to hold so dearly."
  MTS_use_for_hard_labor:0 "Use Them for Hard Labor"
  MTS_use_for_hard_labor_desc:0 "With the worst of the riots dealt with either through force or through coercion, there only remains the choice of what to do with those who raised their voices against the Empress's chosen government. Since they have proven that they clearly do not wish to take part in our blessed society, they should at least contribute something, while they remain stationed away, for both our and their safety."
  MTS_facilities_for_integration:0 "Facilities for Integration"
  MTS_facilities_for_integration_desc:0 "Now that the majority of those who resisted us have been pacified, we must do something to ensure that a mistake of this caliber never happens again. Thankfully, the Empress and Priestess Night are not without mercy, and they shall be rehabilitated: taught the ways of the Empress, and joined back into the fold, so that all my live in our glorious peninsula in safety."
  MTS_destroy_remains:0 "Destroy the Remains"
  MTS_destroy_remains_desc:0 "Although few in number, there were some that took opportunity at the unrest that was in our lands to spread the most vile of heresies and to foment complete and utter defiance at the Empress's will. It may be painful, as it will mean that there will be some who will never partake in her blessings, but we must stamp these cancers out before they fester and grow further. The Inquisitionis's job is not done yet."
  MTS_opportunities:0 "An Opportunity"
  MTS_opportunities_desc:0 "The thestral population of the South-East, although they aided COBSOC, received further harsh treatment from their supposed original liberators. Although this is far from a popular move among some of the hardliners within [MTS.GetNameDef], what better way to prove that we mean what we say, and that the Empress can purify all, than by extending a hoof of support to them?"
  MTS_relegate_to_shadows:0 "Relegate to the Shadows"
  MTS_relegate_to_shadows_desc:0 "Thestrals are creatures of the night, and this will never change. Their traditions and their culture is at such odds with the Empire's, that even with our newfound peace with them, there is little hope of them ever fully integrating within [MTS.GetNameDef]. It is a pitiful state, and we should at least do something to aid in their survival. Perhaps some token aids and support structures, to at least keep them out of poverty?"
  MTS_purify_darknesss_grip:0 "Purify the Darkness's Grip"
  MTS_purify_darknesss_grip_desc:0 "Simply because thestrals are nocturnal, that does not mean that they can never be brought into the Empress's fold, just like some pegasi have. Although it will be excrutiatingly difficult, we should offer education, military openings, and the like, to those that are interested, so that they may take their new knowledge of the Empress to their homes and villages, and one day the division between day and night will truly be eliminated."
  MTS_workforce_underpinnings:0 "Workforce Underpinnings"
  MTS_workforce_underpinnings_desc:0 "Since they will be forever at a disadvantage compared to the normal pony, thestrals should be kept in mind as the economy recovers, as leaving them destitute will only ensure that there will be unrest for the future. Like the aids, these economic considerations should be kept as quiet as possible, to avoid disquiet in the average population. Further production, only for night labor, could provide some needed money for the thestrals, and keep the peace elsewhere."
  MTS_syncretic_command:0 "Syncretic Military Command"
  MTS_syncretic_command_desc:0 "Thestrals have an uncanny ability to notice things where others would not see nor hear anything of note. While the Militarium has used its magic and technology to the best of its ability to offset a normal pony's average at best senses, integrating thestral units into all squads for reconnaissance and light skirmishing will make our forces all the more adept at defending our home."
  MTS_reap_whats_sown:0 "Reap What is Sown"
  MTS_reap_whats_sown_desc:0 "Through the Empress's blessing and a smidgen of force of will, thestrals have been integrated within [MTS.GetNameDef] to the greatest extent they can be. To fully heal the divide between us will probably take generations, but at least we have been put on a start to eventually cement a permanent place in our society for the thestral, the former creature of darkness."
  MTS_modern_southeasterner:0 "The Modern Southeasterner"
  MTS_modern_southeasterner_desc:0 "Unlike the days of when Daybreaker directly ruled this land, we do not have a population that lives in fear of being burned at the stake for the slightest wrong move; nor do we have a citizenry that toils around the clock for sustinence like when Cobalt Hoof commanded the peninsula. The South-East is on the path to a truly blessed life, with ponies working in unity, if at the moment a bit forced, to all serve the Empress, as one, forever."
  MTS_warmth_of_heart:0 "Warmth of the Heart"
  MTS_warmth_of_heart_desc:0 "We are not flesh machines, which only think and act, without a consideration of others. Although the mind is imperative for acting, it is the heart that drives a pony's empathy and understanding of others, that breaks for the downtrodden, and bleeds for the separated. There are numerous ponies that have tales such as those, and we would be best remember from where we once came, and show that empathy and mercy to others, so that more may join the Empress's cause."
  MTS_our_place_with_sun:0 "Our Place with the Sun"
  MTS_our_place_with_sun_desc:0 "With the South-East now following the Empress, it is time that we finally turn our eyes on our brothers and sisters to the north. Sanctum Solar must welcome us back, even if we were slightly unorthodox. There are simply too many who will serve and die for the God-Empress to turn us away."
  ###Daybreaker Acceptance###
  MTS_embrace_of_empress:0 "Embrace of the Empress"
  MTS_embrace_of_empress_desc:0 "As has been preached by Priestess Night and the rest of the Adoratio, we have seen the light of the Empress's mercy and grace. Sanctum Solar has greeted us with open arms, and we have returned to the fold of the rest of our brethren, united, and ready to see all those under us live with a sole mind to follow her."
  MTS_ordo_crossroads:0 "Crossroads of the Ordo"
  MTS_ordo_crossroads_desc:0 "Although the citizenry have pledged to follow the Empress, it seems that there are still old ways that have not yet fully died to her. With the last threats to our safety seemingly eliminated, they have had time to navel gaze, and are now expressing desires of autonomy within the greater Solar Empire. This must be dealt with quickly, lest all our hard work be lost."
  MTS_continue_flame:0 "Continue the Flame"
  MTS_continue_flame_desc:0 "The idea of indepdence under the Empress is a preposterous concept! While ponies may be blessed with faculties and self-awareness, only those who have been ordained by the Solaris Cultus are capable of making the decisions necessary to ensure stability within [MTS.GetNameDef]. These winds of unrest will pass eventually, and we will outlast them."
  MTS_republican_solarists:0 "Republic of Solarists"
  MTS_republican_solarists_desc:0 "Obstensibly the Cultus is an organization of likeminded and equal ponies, who serve the Empress and are thereby made sanctified. In this way, some have argued that the Cultus can hold to some level of democratic ideals. They are not without a point, and with the unrest unlike to abide, perhaps it is best to listen to some of the ideas of these radicals, if only to humor them."
  MTS_refine_adoratio_council:0 "Refine the Adoratio Council"
  MTS_refine_adoratio_council_desc:0 "Simply because we do not acknowledge the plebians' desire to self-rule, that does not mean that we will ignore them. We built our nation on finding a common ground, and reforming to the true religion that the Adoratio had fallen from. Although the orthodox from the Empire may chafe, we must further listen to our citizens, or we will find ourselves in utter ruin."
  MTS_congregants_for_churches:0 "Congregants for Churches"
  MTS_congregants_for_churches_desc:0 "Like any true Solarist nation, [MTS.GetNameDef] has churches in every settlement, priestesses around every corner. While much has been done to free the most destitute from the grips of poverty, there are always ponies who may be down on their luck, and require assistance. In exchange for listening to the good word, everypony will be welcome to stay our churches, for as long as they desire."
  MTS_sisters_of_sympathy:0 "Sisters of Sympathy"
  MTS_sisters_of_sympathy_desc:0 "It is not merely enough to claim to be sanctified through Daybreaker, but we, as her chosen ponies, must also prove it through our actions. In the past, most thought that was purging the ponies in our midst that resisted the Empress, but it has become clear with time. Whenever there is suffering, it must be rectified, no matter the sacrifice of the faithful reacting to it."
  MTS_preaching_to_choir:0 "Preaching to the Choir"
  MTS_preaching_to_choir_desc:0 "As those who are the least fortunate have begun to utilize our offerings of free, indefinite lodging, it is clear that many are still lost and know not that the God-Empress can guide them to salvation. While we have have been giving some guidance already, it is time we ramp up our efforts, so that not a single soul may be lost."
  MTS_first_law_charity:0 "First Law: Charity"
  MTS_first_law_charity_desc:0 "For too long, the Adoratio has hoarded the tithes and donations of the faithful to sit, of which they do nothing afterward. What example is this? How are ponies supposed to know of the Empress's provisions if we do not provide from ourselves? From now on, every bit that enters a church must be spent on the community around it, otherwise our testimonies mean nothing."
  MTS_wise_council:0 "A Wise Council"
  MTS_wise_council_desc:0 "Only the God-Empress is truly fit to rule alone, and all those under her who have been given positions of authority should surround themselves with critical and discerning ponies. Although an electorate will never be established, finding the brightest and most learned among the populace and the Adoratio will only be a benefit, if we wish to remain rightly led."
  MTS_high_mage_of_south:0 "High Mage of the South"
  MTS_high_mage_of_south_desc:0 "Were it not for the bravery of Priestess Night to stand up for all those under her, and admonish and correct Scorched Earth, the South-East would be a different nation, suffering under the ill-fated theories of an extremist. As our own currently autonomous region within the Empire, we should elect our own head of the Adoratio, and there is only one pony who fits the bill."
  MTS_final_surge:0 "The Final Surge"
  MTS_final_surge_desc:0 "Much has already been done on the state of our nation. The industry is far more effective than it was nary a few years before, and ponies live in relative comfort, barring some pockets of abject poverty. But we are not done, nor should we ever believe we are truly finished. Yet one, last push: one more series of reforms, should see the vision of Priestess Night finally realized, and ponies truly blessed."
  MTS_filling_gaps:0 "Filling the Gaps"
  MTS_filling_gaps_desc:0 "Ever since Archmage Pinpoint began planning the overthrow of Priestess Night, the Inquisitionis has had lilttle influence within society. There are still small reasons to keep it, and to do so will require somepony steadfast enough to hold faithfully to the position, and to shine light onto the unenlightened. Few are fit for it, but Luminous Blade has proven her worth time and again, and it appropriate to finally reward it."
  MTS_grand_leap:0 "The Grand Public Leap"
  MTS_grand_leap_desc:0 "With the weight of the Empire behind us, we can finally push through some of the last plans and reforms that are needed to turn the South-East into a true economic powerhouse. During this transition, there will be some pain and sacrifice, but it will ultimately lead to the betterment of all. Ponies will thank us in the end, even if they must hurt for a short time."
  MTS_further_military_exports:0 "Further Military Exports"
  MTS_further_military_exports_desc:0 "While we may not wish war, as it will only negatively affect our faithful, that does not mean we do not have a military industry. It is something that every nation requires, and we are no different. However, now that we are protected further by the Empress, we can perhaps alter our economic plans, and make a small bit of money for all of us in the process, if we sell to them."
  MTS_nurture_public_industries:0 "Nurture Public Industries"
  MTS_nurture_public_industries_desc:0 "Although we are now in a greater economic sphere, as we now have access to the Empire's vast stores of wealth, that does not mean we should neglect what has made our support network so robust. We must further invest within our local industries, or otherwise we will only lose them to the great cities of Manehattan or Fillydelphia instead, and suffer for it."
  MTS_masters_of_arms:0 "Masters of Arms"
  MTS_masters_of_arms_desc:0 "With us no longer requiring the pressure of protecting ourselves, and thereby meeting quotas, we can instead focus on the quality of our weaponry, so that those who receive them will guard them and us far better than before. Any and all that wish to fight with the Empress are welcome to buy from us, and we will show the world our love of the Empress through our masterful crafstponyship."
  MTS_drilling_for_liquid_gold:0 "Drilling for Liquid Gold"
  MTS_drilling_for_liquid_gold_desc:0 "The South-East has been known for years to house great pools of oil, due to the extreme amounts of biomass that have slowly turned into it over the millennia. Much of this prospecting had stopped under COBSOC, but we must resume it, so that we can benefit from it all, and fill our coffers for our citizens' good."
  MTS_natural_exporters:0 "Natural Exporters"
  MTS_natural_exporters_desc:0 "With our cottage industries booming, we are slowly becoming recognized in the Empire and abroad that our craftsponies are capable of quality unlike many others. It is only right that this be encouraged further, and delegations with various nations be created so that more of our worshipful creations be experienced by all, and bless our ponies while doing so."
  MTS_poverty_of_past:0 "Poverty of the Past"
  MTS_poverty_of_past_desc:0 "For decades, the pony of the South-East has had to wonder whether they would have enough food on their tables to feed themselves and their families, or if they would have to scrounge from the opulent few who remained in good grace with COBSOC. But over time, the reforms of Priestess Night have lifted the floor of these lost souls, and with the last provisions in place, never again will anypony under us go hungry, or poor, again!"
  MTS_defense_guidance:0 "Defense Guidance"
  MTS_defense_guidance_desc:0 "Despite differences, despite disagreements, despite grumblings, Scorched Earth has remained one of the leading generals of [MTS.GetNameDef] and without some of his plans, we would have been lost far before we ever reached a point of hegemony on the Peninsula. As a pony of many tactics, it is time he earned a greater honor than he already has, and lead all our armies, to defend our ideals of equality under the Empress."
  MTS_hold_first_congress:0 "Hold the First Peninsular Congress"
  MTS_hold_first_congress_desc:0 "To transition to a democratized system of theocracy is no easy task, after years of centralized leadership from Priestess Night and the Adoratio. In a region of tens of millions, voices must be heard from all walks of life, and that can only be done in a location where all agree to meet. To lead [MTS.GetNamedef] into a bright future, we must hold the first congress in Baltimare. Ideally there will be little dissent in such a choice."
  MTS_elections_of_faithful:0 "Election of the Faithful"
  MTS_elections_of_faithful_desc:0 "As discussed in the congress, one requirement of this new system, this semi-autonomy, will be electing the most worthy among the populace of our faithful citizens. Words such as "election" and "ballot" are not common vernacular to either the Southeasterner nor the Imperial, but to ensure that all of us are treated as one, equal body, we must ensure that free and open elections are had by all. With minimal violence."
  MTS_separations_of_sun_and_earth:0 "Separations of Sun and Earth"
  MTS_separations_of_sun_and_earth_desc:0 "Although the Adoratio has provided execellent guidance through Priestess Night's leadership, mingling both religion and state can lead to corruption and abuse under the wrong hooves. To ensure that politics remains political, and religion religious, our congress has moved to give the Adoratio an advisory status only, lest their laws revert to become oppression in the future."
  MTS_religious_liberty:0 "Champions of Religious Freedom"
  MTS_religious_liberty_desc:0 "As a cornerstone of the freedom that ponies have to choose their duly elected representatives, it is also appropriate that they can choose what to do in worship. They are free to honor and bless Daybreaker however they wish. If ponies think they are free of obligation to her, however, they will be sorely mistaken."
  MTS_guidance_on_missions:0 "Guidance on Missions"
  MTS_guidance_on_missions_desc:0 "Simply because the theocracy has been mostly taken out of the government, that does not mean that those who are elected should ignore their electorate. Absolute power corrupts absolutely, no matter what, but having the right tool to sharpen and keep them in check, should ensure that our ponies are well cared for into the future!"
  MTS_transitional_chairponies:0 "Transitional Heads"
  MTS_transitional_chairponies_desc:0 "While it remains to be seen exactly how the Empire will react to our desire for autonomy, it must not deter us from exercising our desire for a free government. With our representatives chosen, there is only a matter of who will lead us into the future, either as a free region of the Empire, or a special autonomy region within it. Names familiar and not have come forward, and it is only a matter of who will be picked."
  MTS_figure_of_salvation:0 "Figure of Salvation"
  MTS_figure_of_salvation_desc:0 "While she may not be a goddess, nor does she desire to be worshiped like one, were it not for Warm Night's actions, the South-East would still be in disarray or under some oppressive regime. As one of the first acts of our official government, she will be honored for the feats she has accomplished, as the mother of all that we hold dear within our nation."
  MTS_peninsula_repaired:0 "A Peninsula Repaired"
  MTS_peninsula_repaired_desc:0 "Although it was an uphill climb at times, the cycle of poverty and oppression in the South-East has been completely shattered. Our ponies follow the Empress, and live in her blessing, as one. If there is any time that we can in turn bless the Empire, it is now. Forever will we live in prosperity, thanks to the love of Daybreaker!"
  ###Celestia Acceptance###
  MTS_acceptance_of_false_goddess:0 "Acceptance from the False Goddess"
  MTS_acceptance_of_false_goddess_desc:0 "Many have decried Priestess Night as a radical for even daring to contact the false goddess Celestia, but she has claimed that the ideals of the harmonists are not as far-off as ours, and that if Celestia can see reason, then we will never have to worry about losing our citizens in another war. It is already too foolish to attack [EQS.GetNameDef], so must only pray that she succeeds in her mission in Sanctum Solar."
  MTS_entreating_reason:0 "Entreating Reason"
  MTS_entreating_reason_desc:0 "Traveling to Sanctum Solar - Canterlot - was to ensure that the harmonists understood that our ways would not be changing to fit their idealistic, naive ways. However, the meetings with Celestia have gone on far longer than Warm Night intended, with topics far more diverse, and brushing apostasy, than should be allowed."
  MTS_reciprocating_care:0 "Reciprocating Care"
  MTS_reciprocating_care_desc:0 "In outlining how both the harmonists' and our goals on ensuring the prosperity of everypony, it is hoped that Celestia will see that there is no need to alter or force upon us some heretical concept of pacifism, friendship, or diversity. Thus far, she has agreed to all of Priestess Night's points, but there must be an ulterior motive somewhere. She must not twist our resolve into an object lesson!"
  MTS_radical_reforms:0 "Radical Reforms"
  MTS_radical_reforms_desc:0 "Warm Night has returned from Canterlot a changed mare, like many feared. Already, she is using her position as the newly annointed "governor" of [MTS.GetNameDef] to completely undo all that she had originally accomplished! Many of the planned state projects have been canceled, and more private industry from [EQS.GetNameDef] is flooding into our lands. She claims benefits, but will they ever surface?"
  MTS_encourage_capitalists:0 "Encourage Capitalism"
  MTS_encourage_capitalists_desc:0 "As thought, one of the first additional legislations pushed through by the governor's office is the abolishment of the planned economy, which has benefited so many, to give way to competition and private land and business ownership. Our doors have opened even to the Equestrian pigs of the Rich family or Flim-Flam Arms. These may bring money and taxes, but they also bring special interests and corruption. How can anything postive come from this?"
  MTS_relinquish_control:0 "Relinquish Complete Control"
  MTS_relinquish_control_desc:0 "Since she overcame Scorched Earth, Warm Night has had the ultimate say in any matter that was brought before her. While she did have her advisors and council, she was the one who determined the final outcome. Yet now this hiearchal structure like that of the Empress's rule has been compromised. A separate collection of offices have been created as the comptrollers of the economy and society. They will be marred with red tape: how can they guide us into the future?"
  MTS_royal_tour:0 "A Royal Tour"
  MTS_royal_tour_desc:0 "[EQS.GetLeader] has expressed from the start that she has had an extreme interest in seeing the South-East "saved" from misguided path of communism. We are no communists! We are Solarists! This visit by her will no doubt show our superior way of life, even with its current compromises, and she will surely relent on forcing us into the Equestrian way. Surely she will, won't she?"
  MTS_unhindered_exploitation:0 "Unhindered Exploitation"
  MTS_unhindered_exploitation_desc:0 "To further ensure that there are ample resources for manufacturers and citizens, long-standing laws regarding wages, their growth, and starting compensation have been altered. Many workers were, due to unionization, receiving far too much pay for far too little work. These changes should allow for employers to appropriately compensate them, while maintaining their bottom line more effectively."
  MTS_union_backbone:0 "Union Backbones"
  MTS_union_backbone_desc:0 "Recently there was discussion regarding altering the compensation laws in the South-East, but it has been thoroughly rejected. Were it not for the many loyal and faithful workers, the South-East would still be a backwater region of Equus. We would not be where we are without their collectivization and support. It may lead to higher costs, but that is a small price to pay for stability and prosperity for everypony."
  MTS_war_of_competition:0 "War of Competition"
  MTS_war_of_competition_desc:0 "A tenet of all free market and capitalist economies is that of competition. A corner could have five different hayburger establishments, and all could flourish if they compete on different things. That has been lacking within the South-East, since COBSOC's rise, and by further encouraging it, ponies from all walks of life will create the best places for citizens to support themselves with."
  MTS_southeastern_economic_zone:0 "The Southeastern Economic Zone"
  MTS_southeastern_economic_zone_desc:0 "As the largest economy in the southern section of Equus, we command a mighty position to dominate trade within the sea zones around us. By opening our economy to [EQS.GetNameDef]'s as well as the maritime neighbors which are still friendly to us, we can only further prosper and expand the supports for all of our citizens."
  MTS_helping_themselves:0 "Helping Themselves"
  MTS_helping_themselves_desc:0 "With the open borders policy that we have with our economic neighbors, our citizens have begun to see their standards of living increase, as businesses reorganize themselves for further efficiency in the most affordable locations, and workers move to where the best jobs for them are being offered. There have been some grumblings about the destitute being left behind, but they have simply not tried hard enough. They will get there, one day."
  MTS_new_gospel:0 "A New Gospel"
  MTS_new_gospel_desc:0 "Since returning from Canterlot, Warm Night has had little else to say other than the wonders that harmony apparently brings. These new tenets that she is sharing is diametrically opposed to much of what she was espousing only a year before. Many have been spared her sermons, but those closest to her must endure her apostasy, lest they be relieved by our new overlord."
  MTS_minimal_disruption:0 "Minimal Disruption"
  MTS_minimal_disruption_desc:0 "Something that Scorched Earth has held to for years is the concept of living a minimalist lifestyle, in accordance with asceticsm, and his own brand of warrior code. Although this can never be truly replicated by the common pony, as much as he would have wanted to try, that does not mean that ponies cannot live in some manner of simple living, which many harmonists already do. It should be easy for him to see that his dreams may have already been met."
  MTS_redirected_fervor:0 "Redirected Fervor"
  MTS_redirected_fervor_desc:0 "Confided many times by Luminous Blade to Warm Night was her desire, above all else, to protect ponies, from others, from heresy, from themselves. These ideals made for a strong inquisitor, but also make for a strong leader in Celestia, who shares the desire to protect and guide ponies just as much. Revealing such a desire from harmonists, should show that, perhaps, some of those trusts were misplaced, in a goddess who wished for worship above all else."
  MTS_full_pardons:0 "Full Pardons"
  MTS_full_pardons_desc:0 "Although they are not truly committed to harmony, both Scorched Earth and Luminous Blade are both vital leaders in the military, which has remained largely of former Militarium members, and could maintain some influence as they work with Warm Night. Since they have had many of their sins brought to light, some of Celestia's officials have asked for a trial, but Warm Night still carries some powers that can prevent them, if she so chooses."
  MTS_early_retirements:0 "Early Retirements"
  MTS_early_retirements_desc:0 "As Scorched Earth and Luminous Blade have not fully resolved to back away from Daybreaker's influence, their continued presence could be encouragement for others to defy Celestia and remain hostile toward her. While some are calling for punishment for the crimes that may have been committed in the past, there are still some protections that Warm Night can provide and still dole some consequence for unjust actions."
  MTS_wayward_wanderers:0 "Wayward Wanderers"
  MTS_wayward_wanderers_desc:0 "To claim that Scorched Earth and Luminous Blade are harmonists would not be accurate. To say they have friends would be denied, yet they carry some special relationships between themselves and others, and to call them hostile to harmony in general is far from accurate. They are merely taking the longer route to receive enlightenment as Warm Night did, which is fine. While they wander, they can still provide assistance when needed, for their additional exposure could convince them to repent."
  MTS_end_forced_service:0 "End of Forced Service"
  MTS_end_forced_service_desc:0 "With Warm Night's arrival back in Baltimare, her distaste for maintaining a large standing army has only increased, after whatever poisons were introduced by Celestia to her. Although she was reluctant to do so, she originally authorized the numbers required for our defense, and now she wants to reduce them. This may be popular with unwilling soldiers, but how else shall we defend our borders if it comes to war?"
  MTS_mass_honorable_discharge:0 "Mass Honorable Discharges"
  MTS_mass_honorable_discharge_desc:0 "The gutting of the Militarium's numbers has only continued, as investigations of secret dissenters to serving, or those with clear desires to leave have begun, and have led only to further thinning of our troops. Perhaps this has eased our logistical burdens, and has meant that our military works more effectively, but with so few serving, what will happen in the face of invasion and there is nopony to fight?"
  MTS_innovate_protection:0 "Innovate Protection"
  MTS_innovate_protection_desc:0 "As our number of troops thins by the day, the only saving grace is that there are now more resources to use for military research. Many of our factory owners who have fed our need for weapony have complained of lower orders, and less of them as new designs have been implented that are more reliable, but Warm Night desires to ensure that no soldier fighting is left without working equipment, even if it angers those who guarded us before."
  MTS_royal_inspection:0 "A Royal Inspection"
  MTS_royal_inspection_desc:0 "Like Warm Night, [EQS.GetLeader] has espoused a dislike of violence and of war, yet hypocritcally, has remained in charge of a large military in [EQS.GetNameDef]. Supposedly some of the orders to demilitarize have come from Canterlot, but Celestia surely was not the only guilty party in charge of hampering our ability to fight. We can only hope that she sees how we've been left defenseless, and responds by rescinding the mad orders."
  MTS_warriors_of_peace:0 "Warriors of Peace"
  MTS_warriors_of_peace_desc:0 "Since the reforms to the military, our forces have grown to work somewhat more effectively together. Due to this, many regions have completely abandoned any local militia that could be called upon so that instead they can focus entirely on working to better the lives of their inhabitants. Likewise, [EQS.GetNameDef] has promised us protection, and further encouraged this process. The few that remain shall spread harmony wherever they go, and be our represinatives to the world."
  MTS_all_opportunities:0 "Accept All Opportunities"
  MTS_all_opportunities_desc:0 "Although we are no longer required to field an independent nation's army, we should not deny any who wish to serve in the Militarium the chance at becoming a defender of the South-East and of Equus. Due to lower numbers, we have had the time to refine our curriculum to perfection, and can safely say that our forces are some of the most elite out there on the continent. Wherever they go, they will carry the torch with pride."
  MTS_war_of_minds:0 "War of Minds"
  MTS_war_of_minds_desc:0 "In warfare, it is not always the total numbers that wins battles, but the smartest and most effective leaders and battalions. With our varied ecosystem on the peninsula, we have opportunities for diverse training that few other countries could possibly dream of, and it would be foolish to let that slip through our hooves. Opening up our academies even to Equestrian students will only further bolster our forces, as word of our elites spread throughout the continent."
  MTS_harmonic_evangelists:0 "Harmonic Evangelists"
  MTS_harmonic_evangelists_desc:0 "While we may no longer have an active military to fight on widespread wars, that does not mean we cannot assist in other areas of the world where harmony has faltered. Our forces are filled with eager soldiers who wish to help liberate and protect those who are vulnerable, and by ensuring that they aid with care and friendship, only more will come to support Celestia's cause."
  MTS_liberated_army:0 "A Liberated Army"
  MTS_liberated_army_desc:0 "At one time, the Militarium was a cudgel to hammer and oppress those who defied the will of Daybreaker, and to fight and kill those that lived outside of the Empire who rejected her rule. However, that was misguided by placing trust in an alicorn who cared not who lived or died, so long as she was worshiped. Seeing through the darkness now, our soldiers instead realize they are meant to defend the ideals of freedom, and that only further spurs their desire to fight for the greater good."
  MTS_embrace_of_sun:0 "Embrace of the Sun"
  MTS_embrace_of_sun_desc:0 "We have been separated from the rest of Equestria for decades, and through the guidance that Warm Night has provided, we can see that so much of it was fruitless and only caused loss. We no longer have a wedge dividing ponies, and we can only thank Celestia and Warm Night for their tireless work. What can keep us from joining now, and seeing Equestria once more become whole?"
  ###Daybreaker Rejection###
  MTS_suns_disapproval:0 "The Sun's Disapproval"
  MTS_suns_disapproval_desc:0 "It is as many feared would happen. Although Warm Night has lessened the blow as best she can, it must be admitted that our ways are too different from those in [SLE.GetNameDef], and that the ultimate likelihood that we would have been accepted with open arms was minimal. We are on our own, and we may already have targets on our backs, but that does not mean we are without hope. Our unity together will get us through, no matter how dark the tunnel!"
  MTS_defense_for_ages:0 "Defense for the Ages"
  MTS_defense_for_ages_desc:0 "To stand against the might of [SLE.GetNameDef] is not a simple task, and it will require the combined efforts of all those who wish to see the South-East remain free and unopposed to live in faith and unity. Everypony must serve in some way, and we must ensure that they all know the stakes for which we are fighting. If they do not, then we might as well surrender now and hope for amnesty."
  MTS_comforters_of_lost:0 "Comforters of the Lost"
  MTS_comforters_of_lost_desc:0 "Although many have come to trust in Daybreaker's salvation, there are still more that live within the South-East that have been allowed to remain secular. These, as well as the faithful, have heard of the misfortune that has befallen us, and the worries of the general public are increasing by the hour. Our priestesses must work around the clock, or everypony will falter in their walk, and leave us ripe for the picking."
  MTS_service_for_bits:0 "Service for Bits"
  MTS_service_for_bits_desc:0 "Although every soldier is already provided a living wage, that has not been enough to motivate some to join, and has left our numbers less than we had hoped for. As we only have so many resources, we cannot hope to fully fund Warm Night's proposal for long, but offering higher compensation for those on the fence will hopefully provide us with more bodies to defend our lands. We can only hope the coffers don't dry up, first."
  MTS_regional_differences:0 "Regional Differences"
  MTS_regional_differences_desc:0 "As the South-East is a large peninsula, it is inevitable that there will be some slight differences in message and beliefs about the Empress. That should not divide us, though, as so long as we all worship the same Empress, who should really be upset over one minute detail, such as the way that one should tithe?"
  MTS_embrace_regional_autonomy:0 "Embrace Regional Autonomy"
  MTS_embrace_regional_autonomy_desc:0 "With the South-East divided administratively into multiple states and regions, those divisions are futher applied down to the settlement level. Many that have lived on the frontier have formed paramilitary groups in the recent past, as defense from predators, or as defense against invasion. We cannot ask these soldiers to follow us, but if we acknowledge their right to exist, perhaps they will throw their lot in with us, anyway."
  MTS_unique_light:0 "Unique Light"
  MTS_unique_light_desc:0 "The Empress is the one who is the light of all Equus. Although she has revealed herself to us in one way, that does not mean that others cannot have their own knowledge of her commands and her desires. Who are we to judge, so long as the Empress is worshiped, and ponies follow us to defend our home and way of life?"
  MTS_rapid_reactions:0 "Rapid Reactions"
  MTS_rapid_reactions_desc:0 "Traditional structures of military command require that at least a couple of priestesses are dispatched with any large military action, to preach to troops and oversee aid. This has sometimes led to bottlenecks in how quickly a campaign can begin, if priestesses need to volunteer and are reluctant to do so because of other duties. At this time, merging the Militarium and Adoratio will provide us with streamlined responses to invasion, so that we will not worry about infighting when we must all sacrifice to keep each other safe."
  MTS_centralize_control:0 "Centralize Control"
  MTS_centralize_control_desc:0 "Because of the expansive size of the Peninsula, it was expected that, over time, some slight differences would crop up in Warm Night's message, and the theology of Daybreaker's salvation. Some would let this slide, so long as the basics are covered, but allowing it to grow could only spiral out of control into some groups no longer working toward bettering society. We must ensure there is one message, and that everypony follows it."
  MTS_lost_in_churches:0 "Lost in the Churches"
  MTS_lost_in_churches_desc:0 "When ponies gather together, truly amazing things can happen. Corporate worship is a common practice of that, and there is ample evidence that it can be used to both distract and teach to those who partake in it. Ramping up worship services, and perhaps writing some new hymns to sing, could go a long way in keeping our populace's mind off of the looming threats around us."
  MTS_true_image:0 "A True Image"
  MTS_true_image_desc:0 "Over the years, there have been many attempts to fully quantify what Daybreaker represents for all of her followers. She is the light of the sun and the warmth of its embrace. She is the flame that bites at everypony and demands respect. She is the scorching sunlight that will eventually destroy all that it rests upon. However, none capture what she truly is, and it is time that Warm Night make sure that everypony knows just how to strive to attain her perfection."
  MTS_all_will_soldier:0 "All Will be Soldiers"
  MTS_all_will_soldier_desc:0 "It is a detestable fact that at this moment, there is no luxury of sitting on our laurels and hoping that our neighbors, especially [SLE.GetNameDef] will simply let us continue to exist. To protect all that we hold dear, we must further expand our drafts from among the young ponies, otherwise they will have no life left to live if we are invaded and nopony is ready to stop our attackers."
  MTS_militarist_religion:0 "Milistaristic Religion"
  MTS_militarist_religion_desc:0 "Solarism was born in the fires of Daybreaker's ascension, and she has had her impact on its course whether we truly wish to follow that misguided effort or not. The ancient cult may have been mostly underhooved, but the modern Solaris Cultus has had decades of military pedigree with the Solaris Militarium. We are no longer part of the mainline branch, which gives us leeway. Although controversial, merging the Militarium and Adoratio will give all of us the needed military knowledge we need at a moment's notice, and the peace of mind that brings."
  MTS_married_to_job:0 "Married to the Job"
  MTS_married_to_job_desc:0 "It has been clear for some time that Scorched Earth has been looking for a way out of his leadership role. After years of effort, it is to be expected that at some point retirement would call to him, even if it is quite early. Where he goes, more than likely his guard will follow. But they are still faithful servants, and with a bit of persuasion, should be happy to continue serving, in a reduced capacity."
  MTS_on_home_turf:0 "On Our Home Turf"
  MTS_on_home_turf_desc:0 "Just like how it was once used against us, the experience that we have gained fighting and training in the South-East's varied environments can only help with our own troops' knowledge of pre-emptive warfare. We know the crevices and nooks of the jungle, the swamplands, the forests, far better than anycreature invading us, and can use that to our advantage, and trap them before they can even realize their mistakes."
  MTS_prosperity_at_all_costs:0 "Prosperity at All Costs"
  MTS_prosperity_at_all_costs_desc:0 "It is a difficult journey to ensure that every stallion, mare, and foal will have a better future than those that came before, especially in a region that has been historically one of the most destitute in Equus for last three decades. We have come far, but there is much work that still must be done. We can only require that ponies sacrifice for a little longer, so that they may reap their rewards."
  MTS_uncompromising_love:0 "Uncompromising Love"
  MTS_uncompromising_love_desc:0 "Although we could accomplish our goals quicker and more effectively if we pushed ponies beyond their limits, or temporarily rescinded some of the supports they have for funding other projects, we cannot go against what we established for all of our citizens. To turn back now for an easier path would only harm the trust ponies have in us, and above all, we must show them all Daybreaker's mercy and grace."
  MTS_engines_of_future:0 "Engines of the Future"
  MTS_engines_of_future_desc:0 "There are wide tracts of land in the South-East that have laid underutilized since the time of the Great War, and have contributed nothing to the betterment of all of our citizens. Recent shifting of funds have provided the perfect opportunity to change this forever, as we invest in industries to provide for our citizens now and forever into the future. The temporary loss of some programs will be made up for it by the jobs provided by the new factories."
  MTS_ramp_up_recycling:0 "Ramp Up Recycling"
  MTS_ramp_up_recycling_desc:0 "We are a closed system within the South-East, whether we wish to be or not. Our norther neighbors are belligerent, and possible trade partners across the sea are few and far between. However, there is a growing amount of metallic waste that has been building since our citizens' livelihoods have improved. With proper campaigns espousing the holiness of stewardship, we can surely reclaim some of these materials from our citizens for reusing within other projects."
  MTS_furrows_of_food:0 "Furrows of Food"
  MTS_furrows_of_food_desc:0 "Most of the arable land within the South-East, usually situated near the coasts, have been tended to for generations. However, with COBSOC's rise to power and the subsequent nose-dive in education and technological comprehension, many of these farms have reverted to pre-industrial tools out of necessity. It is a miracle of the Empress that they have provided so much already, but imagine what could happen if they were taught the ways of modernity again?"
  MTS_countrywide_supply_lines:0 "Country-Wide Supply Lines"
  MTS_countrywide_supply_lines_desc:0 "As a nation that encompasses the majority of the rainforest and jungle on Equus, there are many areas of the South-East that remain almost completely untouched and unfruitful. For both civilian and military matters, the disjointed road and railway system has functioned, but can lead to expensive or delayed provisions that may be critically needed. Investing into peninsula-spanning networks will only aid us as we reduce transport times and ensure needy mouths are fed."
  MTS_healthcare_served_fresh:0 "Healthcare Served Fresh"
  MTS_healthcare_served_fresh_desc:0 "Out of all of [MTS.GetNameDef], there are only three proper hospitals that serve the entire population: [1214.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], [16.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], and Stableside. For a population of tens of millions, this is simply unacceptable, as most other cities have to rely on the meager skills and services of volunteers and herbal medicines. We cannot be a civilized society without local healthcare. While the investments may be high, it is the only way we can show grace to our citizens."
  MTS_jungles_of_concrete:0 "Jungles of Concrete"
  MTS_jungles_of_concrete_desc:0 "As our citizens propser, we must expand our networks to ensure that, with the return of personal vehicles, that they can freely go from place to place within cities and easily travel large distances. Some of the jungle will be lost, and there may be disquiet around it, but the benefits of inter-regional trade will only lead to further wealth and prosperity for all."
  MTS_empires_of_stone:0 "Empires of Stone"
  MTS_empires_of_stone_desc:0 "With additional chances for success in our cities, some who live in villages and towns have gathered all that they can and emigrated to look for work. Unfortunately, our metropolises can only house so many, and homelessness has grown, despite our previous efforts. Investing into housing projects will not only provide shelter for those on the streets, but create work that can transition into other sectors for everypony."
  MTS_rivers_of_gold:0 "Rivers of Gold"
  MTS_rivers_of_gold_desc:0 "Deep beneath the lands of [MTS.GetNameDef] lay untapped wealth. Although before the Great War some of the oil that sits in the jungles and Badlands had been extracted, there remains much, spread throughout the peninsula, that can be used for our own devices or sold to those willing to trade with us. The bits that this will generate can only improve our ponies lives!"
  MTS_southeastern_paradise:0 "A South-Eastern Paradise"
  MTS_southeastern_paradise_desc:0 "Through toils and troubles, through sweat and tears, the plans of Priestess Night regarding the application of Daybreaker's mercy and grace have finally achieved their intended outcome. Nopony within our borders will ever go needy again, as the generous support programs funded through our public infrastructure will sustain them for generations. This is not heaven on Equus, but it is as close as one can get."
  MTS_independent_actor:0 "Independent Actor"
  MTS_independent_actor_desc:0 "Before it was made clear to us by [SLE.GetNameDef], there was always the assumption that we would be aided by our brothers and sisters to the north. Now, we are a truly new nation, birthed from an exhausting war, and we only wish for our citizens to live in peace. But, as a fledgeling country, we have to keep ourselves aware of reality. We have no friends here. We must fend for ourselves."
  MTS_inward_healing:0 "Inward Healing"
  MTS_inward_healing_desc:0 "Despite the work we've done, there are still rifts that exist between ponies who lived under Cobalt Hoof, or thestrals, or the tribesponies that live deeper into the jungle. We must not let those differences divide us, especially not when our situation is so tenuous. Ensuring that everypony feels heard and their concerns addressed is the only way we can keep from collapsing."
  MTS_addressing_elephants:0 "Addressing the Elephants"
  MTS_addressing_elephants_desc:0 "At one time, we could trust that there would be at least some in [SLE.GetNameDef] that would support us and give us aid when we need it, but not only will that never surface, but we may be seen as a threat. The word of our rejection and subsequent loosing is not isolated to [SLE.GetNameDef], though, and we must be prepared for other nations to probe our defenses, to see if we are ripe for the picking."
  MTS_withdraw_from_world_stage:0 "Withdraw from the World Stage"
  MTS_withdraw_from_world_stage_desc:0 "If we are already alone, then it becomes less and less a concern of ours what other nations choose to do with their time and resources. While achieving a continent-spanning utopia of ponies living under the God-Empress and experiencing her love and peace, it is more important that we focus on those with whom we have been charged now. We shall not remain ignorant, but others will not find our help forthcoming."
  MTS_exempting_brokenhearted:0 "Exempting the Brokenhearted"
  MTS_exempting_brokenhearted_desc:0 "While we may wish to remain focused on our own, we must still accept those who flee to us in desperation. Although [MTS.GetNameDef] is not perfect, it is a sad reality that there are far worse nations in which to live, and our borders still receive thousands of refugees every month. We must welcome them with open arms, so that they may come to Daybreaker, just as so many others already have."
  MTS_aiding_our_own:0 "Aiding Our Own"
  MTS_aiding_our_own_desc:0 "What kind of love do we show if our hearts bleed more for the external, who may never reciprocate our care, and ignore those who live within our borders and still suffer? That cohort is shrinking, but it is not completely eradicated yet! We must innovate in our tactics to combat the persistent poverty issue, before we can resolve the woes of those who surround us."
  MTS_controlling_borders:0 "Controlling the Borders"
  MTS_controlling_borders_desc:0 "We are not unsympathetic to others' plights, but it would be foolish to believe that everypony who is allowed through our borders is innocent. To keep the heaven that we are trying to build under the Empress safe, we must have stronger defenses along points of entry, so that our guards may more easily react to any potential threats, and hold anycreature suspcious who warrants it."
  MTS_jobs_for_jobless:0 "Jobs for the Jobless"
  MTS_jobs_for_jobless_desc:0 "There are some within our nation who are either incapable or unwilling of working what most consider a normal career. However, to make sure that the drain on our now more-limited resources does not become a reality, we will require everypony that can to do something for the betterment of all. Some of it may be considered busywork, but at least they will be contributing something, even if it's as simple as digging ditch."
  MTS_bonds_of_isolated:0 "Bonds of the Isolated"
  MTS_bonds_of_isolated_desc:0 "There are few on this continent that could be seen as a kindred soul, but [SCS.GetNameDef] is also rejected and isolated against some of the larger powers on Equus. We may have some differences, and they may be on rightful Imperial land, but it would be foolish at this time to ignore the benefit of allies, even if it might only be in times of need."
  MTS_path_of_purity:0 "Path of Purity"
  MTS_path_of_purity_desc:0 "Our mission must remain the same, whether we are within the physical embrace of the Empress or not. The Adoratio must lead ponies toward her, and show everypony what true empathy and compassion, what the Empress had shown us when she saved us. No other nation understands this, and aligning ourselves with them would only dilute our mandate. We must defend this at all costs, or at least die trying."
  MTS_shared_missions:0 "Shared Missions"
  MTS_shared_missions_desc:0 "As we both have extreme environments, we and [SCS.GetNameDef] have trained our elite forces to survive in some of the harshest conditions on Equus, but they are not experienced enough. Now that we have access to the deserts of Appleloosa, we can offer joint training programs, so that all ponies, and even some changelings, can work together as a stronger force, for freedom for all."
  MTS_privacy_for_everypony:0 "Privacy for Everypony"
  MTS_privacy_for_everypony_desc:0 "In the Solar Empire, it was expected that a priestess knew most if not all of what her congregation experienced in their personal lives. Matrices were developed for keeping tabs on the faithful, and the Inquisitionis could always investigate a house at any time. Likewise, COBSOC believed every inch of the Peninsula was theirs, and spied on every citizen. This distrust cannot continue. Citizens deserve privacy, and we will fight for them to have it."
  MTS_southeast_homeguard:0 "Home Guard of the South-East"
  MTS_southeast_homeguard_desc:0 "While there is the standing military with the Militarium, plus our elite forces, we do not have a proper auxiliary force, to handle natural disasters or to shore up breaks in a front line in a theoretical war. While there are many militia across the nation, they are not organized. Campaigning to unify them into a nation guard of sort will create a more effective support, and keep them all focused on our primary goal of prosperity for all the faihtful."
  MTS_salvation_outside_the_empress:0 "Salvation Outside the Empress"
  MTS_salvation_outside_the_empress_desc:0 "Since the earliest days of Daybreaker's reign, it was taught and believed that only she and the Holy Flame could provide salvation to anypony who followed her. They would be purified and protected, in exchange for undying loyalty. But this cannot be the case, for we have survived, even thrived, with little intervention from the Empress. Perhaps there are more ways about this, or perhaps we are specially blessed. It requires guarding all the same."
  MTS_lesser_equals:0 "Lesser Equals"
  MTS_lesser_equals_desc:0 "Everycreature is equal under the Empress, but some creatures still must prove that they are worthy of some of this respect. Thestrals have forever been creatures of living and loving darkness, and we must be cautious that some may wish to one day overthrow the paradise we wish to build. It may not be liked by those who have gained our trust, but we must think of our security."
  MTS_rescinding_hatred:0 "Rescinding Hatred"
  MTS_rescinding_hatred_desc:0 "Thestrals are ponies just like earth ponies, pegasi, and unicorns, and the fact that they have been mistrusted for over a millennia since Nightmare Moon first rebelled, only speaks of how far the wounds have been dug into the collective conscious of pony society. There are some bad actors, and there may be a few that seek our downfall, yet we will work to show that thestrals deserve the same equality under the Empress as we all do, as brothers and sisters in Daybreaker."
  MTS_token_labor_force:0 "Token Labor Forces"
  MTS_token_labor_force_desc:0 "To leave the thestrals to starve would be a waste of resources and only open them up to resisting the Empress or fighting our rule. We have seen it play out before, we have seen how it was a threat when we first started integrating thestrals into society. Although they cannot achieve on a large scale the dependability that other ponies can, we must provde some kind of employment for them, so they can at least see that they have been cared for, if marginally."
  MTS_logical_endless_workday:0 "A Logical 24-Hour Workday"
  MTS_logical_endless_workday_desc:0 "A majority of ponies are diurnal, but thestrals are crepuscular or even nocturnal, which can have some key implications for those who are willing to trust them. While we have achieved much with our labor reforms and union agreements, we have yet to achieve production on scales like that in [BUG.GetNameDef] or [SLE.GetNameDef]. We can even the odds by promoting more thestrals work for fair wages, and simply have workers toil around the clock in shifts, without exhausting them all."
  MTS_lunar_solar_cycle:0 "The Lunar-Solar Cycle"
  MTS_lunar_solar_cycle_desc:0 "The thestrals have had their own calendar of holidays since before Nightmare Moon's rebellion. Under COBSOC, these, like all other religious expressions, were banned, with only a single, secular calendar being allowed. While we follow our own, there is nothing stopping us from learning some from our kin, and an extra day or two off will only make the worker's life more manageable."
  MTS_good_pencil_pushers:0 "Good for Pushing Pencils"
  MTS_good_pencil_pushers_desc:0 "Of those who cannot physically labor, the thestrals who show aptitude enough in attention to detail or in different accounting procedures can prove useful in other capacities. The Militarium is not just a military but also a bureaucracy, so having some more menial mental labor will ease the burden on officers who can otherwise plan our defenses."
  MTS_nocturnal_strike_teams:0 "Nocturnal Strike Teams"
  MTS_nocturnal_strike_teams_desc:0 "In the thestral villages and towns, some of the greatest warriors could singlehoofedly defend the settlement from different jungle threats. The two ancient cults, which have been cleansed earlier from [MTS.GetNameDef], had some of the greatest scouts and infiltrators known to ponykind. This experience and aptitude for keeping to the darkness can prove to be a deadly combination with our practical planning. At night, our enemies will have to watch where they sleep."
  MTS_solarist_thestrals:0 "Solarist Thestrals"
  MTS_solarist_thestrals_desc:0 "At some point in the future, the dreams and ideals of the thestral will eventually die away. Although not immediately, they may become an accepted member of society, with their heritage pasturized and only the barest of differences obvious. Training up their next generations will ensure that, although the parents may disagree with us, the thestral pony will one day be another loyal servant of the Empress's will, just like us."
  MTS_great_migration:0 "The Great Migration"
  MTS_great_migration_desc:0 "A majority of the thestral population lives in sparsely inhabited villages and towns, with only one major city to speak of. There are few opportunities for them, and although some will say they prefer it that way, it is no way to live. Finally requiring industrialization, and a movement from the jungles to the urban life, will ensure that they can integrate further within society, whether they like it or not."
  MTS_faith_perfected_socialism:0 "Faith-Perfected Socialism"
  MTS_faith_perfected_socialism_desc:0 "The plaguing issue of Markism is that it sought to achieve what only a goddess could provide. It sought a miracle, but could not do it through natural pony strength alone. Applying the missing puzzle piece of Daybreaker, Warm Night has at last solved the great conundrum, and through our toils, we have wrought as close to perfection as is possible on this sinful world. Our ponies prosper, and everypony praises the Empress. Long live [MTS.GetNameDef]. Long live Warm Night!"
  ###Canterlot Capture###
  MTS_critical_mistakes:0 "Critical Mistakes"
  MTS_critical_mistakes_desc:0 "It was not through luck alone that we have managed to emerge victorious over [SLE.GetNameDef]. [SLE.GetLeader] made a single error: our citizens wish to defend their ways far above the zealots' desires for ruining them. But our accomplishment is not something to celebrate for long, as we now have a new nation to lead, and fellow ponies to aid, no matter their differences from us."
  MTS_addressing_sore_horn:0 "Addressing the Sore Horn"
  MTS_addressing_sore_horn_desc:0 "Under the old regime, ponies in [SLE.GetNameDef] lived in consistent fear of losing their livelihood and spending the rest of their days in squalor. As much as [SLE.GetLeader] claimed to help the poor, there is much evidence it was only for securing ponies' loyalty, rather than of a true wish to help everypony. We will extend our already successful efforts to our new lands, and ponies will see us not as conquerors, but as friends."
  MTS_stamping_out_economic_radicalism:0 "Stamping Out Economic Radicalism"
  MTS_stamping_out_economic_radicalism_desc:0 "It has been known that those who are in the absolute dired of circumstances are most likely to commit crimes. While it was not always discovered when inquisitors found heretics, frequently the ones who were pettier in their crimes tended to struggle with financial problems. Further bolstering supports for them will ensure that we nip the chance of worse behavior in the bud, and keep the Empire stable."
  MTS_infrastructure_for_success:0 "Infrastructure for Success"
  MTS_infrastructure_for_success_desc:0 "Equus is a vast continent, and the South-East is but one portion of it. With our new territories from [SLE.GetNameDef], we must ensure that everypony has an equal chance of freedom of movement, and thereby, we must ensure that our roadways and highways are up to snuff. When everypony can get to anywhere quickly, prosperity can only follow."
  MTS_funding_needed_supports:0 "Funding Needed Supports"
  MTS_funding_needed_supports_desc:0 "There are far too many working-age ponies for too few jobs within the lands of [SLE.GetNameDef], and it is leading to most draining resources passively through inability to work for the Empress, or actively through committing crime. Setting aside large swaths of bits for expanding industrial sectors will provide tens of thousands of new jobs, which can be used to keep the vulnerable off the streets."
  MTS_differences_of_theology:0 "Differences of Theology"
  MTS_differences_of_theology_desc:0 "Contentions between the priestesses that have faithfully followed Warm Night's example and the mainline Solaris Adoratio have slowly boiled since our expansion. They need not fight, however, as there may be some disagreements between the meaning of key scriptures, but they still all wish to see the same thing: loyal Solarists prospering. It may take some time, but they will come around with enough encouragement."
  MTS_dissolve_inquisitionis:0 "Dissolve the Inquisitionis"
  MTS_dissolve_inquisitionis_desc:0 "In a civilized society there is no place for an oppressive and prying group of ponies like those of the Solaris Inquisitionis. In the decades they have fought to keep the Empire free of heresy, they have only further encouraged it through their stringent actions, whereas Warm Night has all but eliminated it through charity and kindness. There is no point keeping it further. The resources can be used elsewhere."
  MTS_appoint_new_lady_inquisitor:0 "Appoint a New Lady Inquisitor"
  MTS_appoint_new_lady_inquisitor_desc:0 "The Solaris Inquisitionis, although once a hammer to beat down anypony who was suspected of heresy or apostasy, is not a completely useless organization. There are tens of thousands of inquisitors, across the entire land of [SLE.GetNameDef], and it would be foolish to not pass up on the opportunity to utilize it. It will have a new mission, though, and that requires a change in leadership..."
  MTS_maintain_ordo_integrity:0 "Maintain Ordo Integrity"
  MTS_maintain_ordo_integrity_desc:0 "Although it acts as one, the Solaris Cultus was not a single administrative unit, and instead was broken into several regions. These Ordos allowed, in theory, the priestesses of each area to more accurately understand the needs of the faithful, although it became more a tool for the Inquisitionis over time. It is an excellent idea on paper, and with some slight revisions, there is no reason we cannot keep it into the future."
  MTS_joy_in_service:0 "Joy in Service"
  MTS_joy_in_service_desc:0 "At one time, the Adoratio primarily served the Empress directly, and the ponies of faith second. While society may have had an air of stability, it only further drove ponies into despair and poverty, and resentment against the openly opulent clergy. But there is more than just serving Daybreaker that our fellow priestesses must understand, for the simple act of aiding others is a reward unto itself. We would do well to reinforce this."
  MTS_holiest_city:0 "The Holiest City"
  MTS_holiest_city_desc:0 "[3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has always captured the hearts and minds of all those who faithful served the Empress and her mandates. As the center of [SLE.GetNameDef], it has occupied a special location, and is the most sacred of all places that a pony can visit. With our citizens more prosperous than ever, we must ensure that this city reflects the beauty of Daybreaker's mercy and love, so that all may be blessed when they arrive."
  MTS_mending_broken_links:0 "Mending Broken Links"
  MTS_mending_broken_links_desc:0 "As of late, the Solaris Militarium has been a fractured, squabbling shell of what it was once capable of. The defeat at our hooves has only further driven that division, and there are some that have holed themselves up in the primary academy on their miltary campus. However, we still serve the same goddess, and we must not spill our brothers' blood thoughtlessly. Sending in somepony who knows both sides, should hopefully resolve the situation."
  MTS_honoring_service:0 "Honoring Their Service"
  MTS_honoring_service_desc:0 "Some higher-ranking officers have served the Empress for twenty or thirty years, and have been shields in defending the Empire from collapsing at further invasion. That faithfulness and duty to the Empress will not go remiss. As they were simply following the misguided orders of those above, we must promise them that they will not be harmed nor prosecuted, as long as they continue to fulfill their oaths."

  MTS_new_production_quotas_desc:0 "With much more territory that we must defend, our previous requirements for new defensive weaponry are becoming too little for ensuring that everypony is properly equipped to fend off any future attacks. Thankfully with the new funds that we have access to, we can expand our industrial complexes rapidly, and also reduce our unemployment at the same time."
  MTS_united_general_staff:0 "United General Staff"
  MTS_united_general_staff_desc:0 "From the earliest days of the Empire, Lord Commander Blueblood has been a stabilizing - if questionable - force in the Militarium to maintain some structure of command. Many of the generals will follow him, whether out of trust or fear, and therefore, the old stallion must be convinced of our cause. Thus far he has remained steadfast in holding out, but surely there will be something to convince him to see our side."
  MTS_monarch_with_limits:0 "An Empress with Limits"
  MTS_monarch_with_limits_desc:0 "The chiefest problem that faced [SLE.GetNameDef] was simply that the monarchy had far too much power, with too little oversight. Although there was an aristocracy that was meant to be delegated to and to oversee some of the Empire's plans, it was frequently overridden or ignored. We do not wish to usurp the role of the Empress, and we wish her to remain on the Celetsial Throne, but from now on, there will be balance. There will be a conscience provided by the Adoratio."

  MTS_popping_balloon:0 "Popping the Balloon"
  MTS_popping_balloon_desc:0 "It is time that we finally execute the first section of Archmage Pinpoint's strategem, since the cat has been taken out of the bag. Our Ordo has been infected with far too many heretics to count, all slowly leading to its downfall. Those too short-sighted will be cleansed as well, but first, we must have the weak-willed understand that WE are the only ones that can be trusted..."
  MTS_stable_soldiers:0 "Stable Soldiers"
  MTS_stable_soldiers_desc:0 "Scorched Earth was a military stallion at heart, and remained popular within the segment of the Militarium that followed him into this abominable place. However, many were simply following orders, and with some encouragement and enlightenment, they will follow us without issue. The rest can simply be discarded, for they had no use for us, regardless."
  MTS_proto_lover:0 "The Proto-Lover"
  MTS_proto_lover_desc:0 "As much as both would deny it, it was clear to any who paid attention - which were few - that Scorched Earth and his charge and bodyguard, Luminous Blade, were approaching dangerous levels of apostasy through pursuing a love that was not fully directed toward the Empress. With Scorched dead, Luminous has gone underground, and has more than likely been part of the recent string of unrest across the Ordo. There are ways of flushing her out, however."
  MTS_clean_executions:0 "Clean Executions"
  MTS_clean_executions_desc:0 "Among the upper eschelons of the former Militem Solar, Scorched Earth had many sycophants who gleefully followed his orders and his absurd demands regarding "asceticism" as a means for sanctifying ponies. Most of these have remained in the Militarium after Archmage Pinpoint's rightful coup, and if they are not made examples of, could lead to a counter-coup as an act of heretical vengeance. We must be the stronger hoof."
  MTS_use_their_own_bait:0 "Use Their Own as Bait"
  MTS_use_their_own_bait_desc:0 "Heretics are predictable, to an extent. Although many have supposed reasons, which differ from each other, for leaving the light of the Empress, they all have a remarkable quality of blind belief that they cannot be ratted out by others of their ilk. Therefore, among the heretics and infidels that we have yet to deal with, we can use some as traps. Whether obvious or not, them remaining "free" be the doom of many others."
  MTS_harsh_punishments:0 "Harsh Punishments"
  MTS_harsh_punishments_desc:0 "There are no words that can properly describe the harm that ponies who resist the Empress's will cause to both the greater whole of ponykind and also to themselves. They simply do not understand, as it is clearly a defect in their minds. Only a harsh hoof is something that they can comprehend, which we will apply liberally and frequently, so that they may begin to learn the error of their ways, before they are cleansed forever."

  MTS_victory_to_those_who_want_it_desc:0 "Defeat is naught but a state of mind.

  MTS_forgone_conclusion_desc:0 "Although some within the Ordo thought that it was still near impossible, it is of no surprise that we conquered the vile heretics. We had the full might of the sun behind us, how could we fail? Now it is only a matter of time until the greatest work the Empire will witness is underway!"
  MTS_full_purification:0 "Full Purification"
  MTS_full_purification_desc:0 "While the Militarium has been cleared of many of the obvious apostates and heretics, that does not mean that there are none with secret, dissenting thoughts. With the South-East now completely under our control, there is time to properly sniff out the rats that infect the purity of the Ordo. Every hidden thought will be discovered and laid bare, and we shall rid ourselves of all who would see us fail!"
  MTS_agreements_with_equals:0 "Agreements with Equals"
  MTS_agreements_with_equals_desc:0 "Although Pinpoint is the lead Archmage of the Inquisitionis in [MTS.GetNameDef], she is not alone in her mission and dedication to eradicating heresy. Throughout the war, some of the important duties were delegated to a close inner circle, and it is this clique that now must be leaned upon again, even if she will not admit it without some convincing."
  MTS_strength_of_sun:0 "Strength of the Sun"
  MTS_strength_of_sun_desc:0 "Although we had to rely upon some of the untrustworthy masses to accomplish our righteous goals, it was only through the might of the Empress, and the power she provides to all of her faithful, that we were able to achieve victory in the peninsula. We must honor that gift, and nurture it until it is embedded in every soldier, so they may fight for glory, and die in her name!"
  MTS_hoofs_that_won_the_war:0 "Hoofs that Won the War"
  MTS_hoofs_that_won_the_war_desc:0 "Infantry and hoofsoldiers have been the mainstay of warfare since the dawn of time, and there is little that should be done to change that. While utilizing advanced technology can be an asset, one which many other sections of the Empire shun, we would be remiss if we ignored the value in a soldier's life. And how much they are willing to sacrifice it."
  MTS_machine_goddess:0 "Machines of the Goddess"
  MTS_machine_goddess_desc:0 "We are not backward brutes like some of the generals within the Empire, stifling technological innovation just for the sake of decrying it as antithetical to the stance of the Empress. She might have used the faithful to stand against the tides of apostasy, heresy, and atheism, but she still used many great inventions of the Great War. We would be fools to ignore this."
  MTS_guns_of_old:0 "Guns of Old"
  MTS_guns_of_old_desc:0 "Long before the days of mechanized warfare that the changelings and griffons pioneered, the cannon was the master of the battlefield, leveling all those that dared oppose the might of ponykind! It is a grand heritage, iterating our guns. Larger barrels, more advanced munitions, and most importantly, crews that will serve to the death instead of abandon their posts will lead to plains leveled in the name of the Empress!"
  MTS_mudslingers:0 "Mudslingers"
  MTS_mudslingers_desc:0 "Archmage Pinpoint is not dogmatic. Throwing away limited lives, while ultimately useful for thinning the worthless heretics, is wasteful without a guarantee that more will be able to be hurled at our enemies in the future. Creating teams of workers to quickly dig out lines which our troops my use for protection, guarded themselves by mobile, deadly, dirt movers, will lead to more successful conflicts when they arise."
  MTS_supplies_for_righteous:0 "Supplies for the Righteous"
  MTS_supplies_for_righteous_desc:0 "The machines which we use to support our troops are hungry creatures, constantly demanding fuel, maintenance kits, or other supplies which could strain our limited resources. When the machines helping the machines break down, all the worse. Yet we will persevere, and through sheer force of will ensure that the supplies arrive where needed, even if our troops must get out and push the vehicles carrying the supplies themselves!"
  MTS_bred_from_jungle:0 "Bred from the Jungle"
  MTS_bred_from_jungle_desc:0 "Many of the heretics and apostates of the South-East have lived and breathed in the putrid air and survived the dank and forboding flora for generations. Although they may be lost causes, that does not mean that they are completely without use, especially since some of them are able soldiers. Either through conscription or through training, our forces will have a core of elite troops, ready to rid our darkest lands from any threat to us, or the Empress!"
  MTS_inquisitors_of_battle:0 "Inquisitors of Battle"
  MTS_inquisitors_of_battle_desc:0 "Who better are meant to lead the wayward and lost souls of our conscripts than the Inquisitionis? Although our numbers are few, Archmage Pinpoint has ensured that the faithful will be able to join our ranks, and further lead the infidels in our military to victory, through pushing them to their limits. Any that break will be shot on sight, as a coward is no use to the Empress."
  MTS_consecrate_tech_priestesses:0 "Consecrate Tech Priestesses"
  MTS_consecrate_tech_priestesses_desc:0 "There is something more than merely the Empress's blessing in the use of technology to accomplish her holy mission against the heretics. The machines themselves are a wonder, living and breathing creations of our own hooves that serve as judge, jury, and executioner to so many unrepentant souls. They may be lessers of the Empress, but they are no less awe-inspiring, and we must ensure that we have sisters who know how to properly care for them, and lead us in reverance to them."
  MTS_clearing_second_war:0 "Clearing for the Second War"
  MTS_clearing_second_war_desc:0 "Although we have little interest at this time in going beyond the South-Eastern Peninsula, it is undeniable that war may come to use before we are prepared to go on the offensive. Through careful tweaking our meager air force's supplies, we can create platforms to rain holy fury upon those that invade us, laying waste to swaths of land and leaving it desolate, thereby becoming of little use to them."
  MTS_structured_and_logical:0 "Structured and Logical"
  MTS_structured_and_logical_desc:0 "A military is like chess or another game of strategy and logic. As the lead researcher and inquisitor of the South-East, Archmage Pinpoint is more than qualified for the position, and, rightly, the only one holy enough to ensure the purity of our mission. A new hierarchy, under the Inquisitionis, shall be created, and our troops will defend our lands from any and all who might wish to us fail!"
  MTS_enforce_border:0 "Enforce the Border"
  MTS_enforce_border_desc:0 "We now have an expansive front from which any one of our enemies could any one of our enemies could invade, or heretics or unrepentant souls could flee between border patrols. Although the resources to create a true curtain of iron across it all is currently out of scope, we can solidify our control in key areas through complex bunker networks, which would act as primary bases to defend and investigate within an immediate area."
  MTS_sight_through_sound:0 "Sight through Sound"
  MTS_sight_through_sound_desc:0 "Many of the technologies that the Empire takes for granted could be further improved upon with solely a smidgen of ingenuity or forethought. For instance, the radio has been with us for decades, yet nopony has ever considered that it not only can it be used to propagate correct thought, it can police it, too, with just a few simple additions to the boxes which contain them. We may not be able to see into every household, but we shall soon hear, and that shall be enough to damn them."
  MTS_dead_language_skills:0 "Dead Language Skills"
  MTS_dead_language_skills_desc:0 "In order to remain as undetectable as possible, we must employ all manner of devices for our informants and speculatores to remain unknown. Through the thousands of years ponykind has roamed Equus, the Ponish language has evolved and morphed over time, and few even know what its early self was like. Instructing our spies in this language, and giving them codes, will greatly reduce the likelihood of discovery, and allow unfettered conversation even among prying ears."
  MTS_in_plain_view:0 "In Plain View"
  MTS_in_plain_view_desc:0 "Magic is infinitely malleable, and illusion magic has been a staple of performers and charlatans alike, where they have used it to project lifelike illusions and misdirect attention for centuries. It will be simple to apply some of their techniques to our own speculatores, enhancing their ability to appear like ponies they are not, or be somewhere where they are not. They shall remain undetectable, even when seen."
  MTS_mistress_of_secrets:0 "Mistress of Secrets"
  MTS_mistress_of_secrets_desc:0 "What better pony to lead by example for how our speculatores and our informants should act with their missions than Archmage Pinpoint herself? As she leads our holy order to victory against the heresy that infects the world, even she must keep her own research secret and unattainable to all but the most trustworthy of ponies. It is for our own protection, and we would do well to model her, lest others learn of our intentions and seek to exploit them for sinful means."
  MTS_secrets_of_body:0 "Secrets of the Body"
  MTS_secrets_of_body_desc:0 "A pony must follow the Empress with all their heart, mind, and body, and heresy is undoubtedly one a wholesale rejection of the Empress's love. Their bodies work against her plans, and clearly, along with the mind itself, are defective. In her studies and research on heretics and their malfunctions, Archmage Pinpoint has achieved understanding of the pony few could dream of, and likewise, how to push it to its limit, and then beyond, without excessive waste. May we all serve the Empress stronger because of her!"
  MTS_cleansing_smoke:0 "Cleansing the Smoke"
  MTS_cleansing_smoke_desc:0 "There are untold throngs of heretics and infidels that we now control, and there are far from enough loyal bodies to police them all. Normally that would be a problem, but with the state that the South-East has been left, there is nothing but endless projects which can be worked on, and some of the first are the most dangerous. A program to reuse any materials in some of the toxic factories across the peninsula would be a good start at thinning the herd."
  MTS_analyze_temptations:0 "Analyze Their Temptations"
  MTS_analyze_temptations_desc:0 "Whether friend or foe, faithful or heretic, there are vices that will lead anypony down the path of utmost sin. Although we do not and never will advocate for such debased thinking, there are numerous avenues that can be pursued if we understood more about what drives many ponies, and how we may best use that knowledge to mantain complacency."
  MTS_endless_construction:0 "Endless Construction"
  MTS_endless_construction_desc:0 "The South-East has been left in a constant state of deterioration, not helped by the climate, the lack of funding from COBSOC, and the unification war. Throughout the entire peninsula, cities and towns have been left to decay, which will make our lands useless if we cannot maintain a connection throughout. Thankfully, there is an infinite supply of bodies which can be used for them, which will keep everypony in line, as well."
  MTS_watchers_of_sun:0 "Watchers of the Sun"
  MTS_watchers_of_sun_desc:0 "In every city there is at least one, if not more, churches of the Adoratio, with more being designated each month, for our sisters to preach the Empress's word and to maintain order within the peninsula. We have been lax before, but with so many heretics abounding, the priestesses must be required to be vigilant and report any activity that Archmage Pinpoint deems suspicious, no matter how outlandish they may believe it is."
  MTS_free_to_labor:0 "Free to Labor"
  MTS_free_to_labor_desc:0 "With so many workers within our lands, it becomes rather impractical to appropriately designated who should go where, and who should do what. That does not mean, however, that ponies are able to do whatever they wish in their free time. While the faithful may have holidays, the unsaved masses have only one duty before their deaths: toil for the Empress, until their dying breaths, no matter where it is."
  MTS_unending_debts:0 "Unending Debts"
  MTS_unending_debts_desc:0 "Every unsaved rebel has a debt that they owe to the Empress for us not burning them on the spot for their lack of reverence to Daybreaker. While a few may be forgiven, as they remain useful for our cause for the moment, the majority now are all servants of the Empress, whether they wish to be or not, and we will direct them as such. Perhaps, if they repent, then one day they will be free. Perhaps."
  MTS_slaves_to_empress:0 "Slaves to the Empress"
  MTS_slaves_to_empress_desc:0 "The very concept of freedom for the infidels is an abhorrent thought among any fo the faithful who follow the Empress. Even her servants in worship, have no will or desire outside of her own, which is provided by the Inquisitionis. To suggest that the commoners have any autonomy is laughable, and they shall soon be brought to heel as we use every resource we can to keep them exactly where they should be: working. Indefinitely."
  MTS_hidden_depths:0 "Hidden Depths"
  MTS_hidden_depths_desc:0 "To remain confident that in the case of war, we will not lose all that we have striven to build, a series of grand projects to create underground networks of assembly lines, supply routes, and other requirements for continued weapons manufacture is begun. When it is completed, our enemies, internal and external, shall be hard-pressed to defang us from biting back, as our workers continue to produce arms, deep beneath the earth."
  MTS_make_useless_useful:0 "Make the Useless Useful"
  MTS_make_useless_useful_desc:0 "It is a true and sad statement that even among the most worthless of heretics, there are those that are even worth the effort to force into labor. These adamantly lazy souls will still provide assistance in one way, though. Their heretical minds are perfect for research, since they are clearly defective, and will lead us ever closer to solving the ultimate problem of the Empire."
  MTS_plunders_of_south:0 "Plunders of the South"
  MTS_plunders_of_south_desc:0 "The South-East is a rich land, filled with natural resources which we can use for ourselves in fighting against heresy and apostasy. Even if they are sealed away deep in the earth or in the jungle, we shall extract every last drop from this land and will use it to the fullest by eradicating heresy once and for all with it!"
  MTS_wholistic_approach:0 "A Wholistic Approach"
  MTS_wholistic_approach_desc:0 "While there are many ponies and thestrals within our lands, along with a few changelings and other non-pony races, we must look outside of ourselves in order to accomplish our greatest feat. Archmage Pinpoint will soon begin Project Hereticus, and in order to have the widest swath of subjects, we must take from within and without. How else can we eradicate heresy before it can take thought, if we do not have all thoughts analyzed?"
  MTS_deceive_deceivers:0 "Deceive the Deceivers"
  MTS_deceive_deceivers_desc:0 "Thestrals are nothing more than darkness incarnate in a pony form; their very nature is opposite any loyal follower of the Empress, and from their mouths nothing but lies and deceptions spew forth. That is not to say that we will eradicate them on sight, however. As we have yet to focus on them at all in our stabilization, we can lull them into security by appearing to be tolerant of their existence. We shall, until we strike and capture them all for good!"
  MTS_what_makes_them_tick:0 "What Makes Them Tick"
  MTS_what_makes_them_tick_desc:0 "At some point in the past, thestrals had to have been full-blooded ponies, but they were obviously corrupted and twisted by Nightmare Moon's magic and turned into the abominations that they are today. They think wholly differently than us, but that doesn't mean we cannot learn from them. Perhaps in all of this, Archmage Pinpoint can learn what went wrong, and reverse it, even if it kills them."
  MTS_reverse_creation:0 "Reverse Creation"
  MTS_reverse_creation_desc:0 "Whatever happened to thestrals, they are too interwoven with bat DNA to properly undo, but the insight that Archmage Pinpoint has gleaned has provided useful nonetheless. Not only do we have a surefire way of finally ridding ourselves of the thestral menace, at the very genetic level, but using where we can special enchantments, we can create weapons that literally fight against a target's body's DNA, ridding us of problems forever."
  MTS_dilute_battiness:0 "Dilute the Battiness"
  MTS_dilute_battiness_desc:0 "Magic was what must have first fused pony and bat DNA together, and magic is the only solution that will solve the thestral problem. It is clearly a genotype and phenotype, and by using specially crafted spells to suppress those traits, living and future generations of thestrals can be returned to some semblance of purity. Even if it doesn't work, the knowledge we gained through Pinpoint's work will help us for decades."
  MTS_secrets_of_mind:0 "Secrets of the Mind"
  MTS_secrets_of_mind_desc:0 "What goes through the brain of a heretic still remains largely a mystery, despite the number of ponies that have been utilized in the name of progress. However, fruit has still been born, as Archmage Pinpoint can use the results to predict future deviation, and likewise, has enough knowledge to influence the minds of others for the benefit of our Ordo."
  MTS_temporary_measures:0 "Temporary Measures"
  MTS_temporary_measures_desc:0 "It is an undeniable fact that while we project strength, the Inquisitionis in the South-East is in a tenuous situation. The Militarium is pacified but neutered, the population is unruly, and the Inquisitionis is small. We have loyal followers in all regions, but their reach, especially from a central location, is too limited. Although we are united as one, we must face reality. We must split the Ordo if we are to survive."
  MTS_buffer_zone:0 "The Buffer Zone"
  MTS_buffer_zone_desc:0 "[OCS.GetNameDef] has been established along the strips of land that border the various threats for us. This must become a militarized nightmare for any that would dare to think to oppose us, and in order for that to happen, a few hdeas will have to remain turned to some of Mage Emerald Days' various quirks, so long as she can keep the peace, and enemies out of our peninsula."
  MTS_state_obvious:0 "State the Obvious"
  MTS_state_obvious_desc:0 "There is little point continuing the ruse that we employed for so long. While [SLE.GetNameDef] declared us rogue as soon as Scorched Earth began his march, there was still some expectation that we would come back begging for forgiveness, with new land in tow. Why should we, when we are the only ones accomplishing the grand mission?"
  MTS_the_sweathouse:0 "The Sweathouse"
  MTS_the_sweathouse_desc:0 "[OAC.GetNameDef] contains one of the richest areas of the South-East, with two great metropolises that are both dedicated to heavy industry. Although the archmage would have preferred to maintain control directly, there is enough problems with maintaining order in two industrial cities, let alone four. Nevertheless, Mage Light Jolt is more than capable of keeping order, especially if it involves any amount of coercion."
  MTS_lesser_spats:0 "Lesser Spats"
  MTS_lesser_spats_desc:0 "Although we remain loyal to the Empress, that does not mean that the rest of the Empire believes that we have stayed orthodox or faithful to her. Archmage Pinpoint was already mistrusted, and now that it is known she has taken over from Scorched Earth, we have seen occasional probing assaults from the northern lands, both of the Empire, and the traitors that left it. These provide valuable experience for [OCS.GetNameDef]'s troops, however."
  MTS_minimizing_esoteric:0 "Minimizing the Esoteric"
  MTS_minimizing_esoteric_desc:0 "It was known from the start that Mage Emerald Days would wish to pursue her own interests within [OCS.GetNameDef], and it was a risk that Archmage Pinpoint was willing to take. Word has already reached that Emerald is seeking to enhance her own cohorts with the strange and fruitless rites and rituals of the zebra. Aside from a few warnings, it shall be allowed, especially if it actually amounts to anything."
  MTS_righteous_overwatch:0 "Overwatch by the Righteous"
  MTS_righteous_overwatch_desc:0 "Even in our directly controlled lands, which are much smaller than before, the threat of heresy remains ever present. However, now that Archmage Pinpoint no longer needs to worry about the affairs of the outer regions, far distant from Baltimare, she can ensure that the Inquisitionis remains steadfast and focused on everypony. A little extra surveillance never hurt anypony, especially the faithful."
  #MTS_inquisitor_librarians:0 "Inquisitor Librarians"
  #MTS_inquisitor_librarians_desc:0 "Who else is worthy enough to learn new knowledge than the few of our ranks that have become inquisitors? Archmage Pinpoint requires additional ponies whom she can rely upon to remain faithful to the Empress, no matter what is found that could shake others into heresy. Although this may anger some, the benefits for eradicating the heretic once and for all must not be ignored, no matter the grumblings!"
  MTS_exploit_masses:0 "Exploit the Masses"
  MTS_exploit_masses_desc:0 "The general population of the South-East are barely worthy of being allowed the blessing of a night's rest, but there are potentially ways around even those base biological requirements. Mage Light Jolt has approached Pinpoint to discuss some of her ideas regarding an "enhancement" program that is little more than a concoction of stimulants to keep one awake. It is a worthwhile idea, given the boost to productivity it will surely provide."
  MTS_project_to_death:0 "Projecet to Death"
  MTS_project_to_death_desc:0 "There is little need for the pony of [OAC.GetNameDef] to worry about war or other distractions that can pull many from laboring constantly for the Empress. Already, the Ordo's industry has far surpassed anywhere else in the peninsula, and that is only thanks to the complete employment of laborers, without a single wasted soul. Time off after projects is unheard of, and will remain so as more are assigned every day."
  MTS_adapting_to_night:0 "Adapting to the Night"
  MTS_adapting_to_night_desc:0 "Unlike the vile thestrals, we are not naturally inclined to darkness and seeing within it. However, there are all manner of spells and magic that can be woven to provide our soldiers with some semblance of night-vision, although the report that Mage Emerald Days has provided speaks of something far deeper, as some of her forces have become almost one with the night itself. If not for her loyalty, it would be most concerning, even if it is beneficial."
  MTS_possessing_hearts:0 "Possesing Their Hearts"
  MTS_possessing_hearts_desc:0 "Everypony who serves within the Militarium must be prepared to perish for the Empress, as it is the only worthy sacrifice that they can provide. The South-East has had a rather low adoption rate of this belief, but reports indicate that soldiers in [OCS.GetNameDef] have signed up in far greater droves. Whatever Mage Days is doing, it is accomplishing the great task with gusto."
  MTS_infrastructure_of_bones:0 "Infrastructure of Bones"
  MTS_infrastructure_of_bones_desc:0 "The South-East has remained relatively isolated from its pockets of settlements since even before the Empire collapsed. Despite the years of "improvement" by COBSOC, this has been left unchanged. Thankfully, Mage Jolt is leading the way with rectifying this issue, as laborers have been expended upon the greatest railway and highway project in the peninsula, which will only benefit us all once it is completed. No matter the body count."
  MTS_resettle_resistant:0 "Resettle the Resistant"
  MTS_resettle_resistant_desc:0 "Like throughout the peninsula, [OAC.GetNameDef] has a multitude of heretics which have yet to be properly dealt with. However, as work never ceases on building the Ordo into a shining beacon of industry, there are other uses for the heretics than research or death. Keeping them locked away in the jungles, until they are needed for projects, has a wonderful ring to it. If they flee, they will perish, by our guns, or the jungle's predators."
  MTS_bits_for_experiments:0 "Bits for the Experiments"
  MTS_bits_for_experiments_desc:0 "Although it is hard to entirely fathom, the experiments into the shamans of Zebrica, the strange magics of the Dread Peninsula, and others, have not gone completely wasted by Mage Emerald Days. There is a power in her troops that is undeniable, and it would be best if we invest what we can into it, so that we may defend our ways as easily as possible, and also further control the heretics more readily."
  MTS_investments_for_future:0 "Investments for the Future"
  MTS_investments_for_future_desc:0 "Industry is the lifeblood of the entire peninsula, and if we fall behind other regions of Equus, we will eventually be overwhelmed and destroyed by those who wish to see us stopped in our eradication of all heresy. Further stimulating the efforts of Mage Light Jolt will leave us better for it, as we will have a reinforced backbone of factories and steel that will prevent any from overcoming us."
  MTS_return_to_normal:0 "Return to Normal"
  MTS_return_to_normal_desc:0 "The shortages of personnel and the lack of proper centralization have been finally removed, and it is time that this temporary situation with the sister Ordos be resolved. Although both mages have done well, they will be better served integrating and bringing their talents back to [ROOT.GetNameDef] than remaining a separate entity. It will be only a matter of time until we are united as one again, and our mission of purity can continue unabated!"
  MTS_silence_all_ears:0 "Silence all Ears"
  MTS_silence_all_ears_desc:0 "The veil has finally been completed around the South-East. Little enter in or out of it without us knowing, and filtering it accordingly.

  MTS_headquarters_of_sea_desc:0 "Now that we have a stepping stone from Equus to Zebrica, we should ensure that there will no chance that we can be dislodged from our position. The island chains leading to Zebrica are rife with small atolls and reefs which we can use to our advantage, either as natural defences, or as small outposts at which our navy can moor and deter anycreature from setting foot onto our territory."
  MTS_learning_from_waters:0 "Learning from the Waters"
  MTS_learning_from_waters_desc:0 "An operation such as what we have just accomplished has not been undertaken by ponykind in decades, and there was much cruft and out of date tactics which hindered us from accomplishing our goals as quickly as possible.

In Cobalt Hoof's arrogance, he simply claimed it was a new city, and went about creating what he believed was the perfect metropolis.

  militem.pinpoint.900.d:0 "Fire is a tried and true method for cleaning many ills from the world. Since the beginning of time, ponies have used its heat for survival, its harm for defense, and its cleansing ability to purify metals, and this application has been furthered in the modern era to more figurative concepts. Specifically, the removal of heresy from the Solar Empire and from the Empress's presence, by the concise use of such a holy element.\n\nBefore the Empress ever revealed herself, the faithful of the Solaris Cultus, living oppressed for so long, knew that there was something with the flame that was sacred. Those details have never been found, and given that conflagrations can be costly in resources or magic to create and maintain, some within the Ordo have wondered if it would be simpler to shoot any heretics found and leave them to rot.\n\nThey're probably right.\n\nHowever, that also asks questions such as, "Why is the Holy Flame a flame?", "What is the maximum temperature a heretic can endure without perishing?", or "Can we really be sure that a fire is actually a fire, and not an inferno instead?"\n\nQuite difficult problems, among others, and we have spent ample resources on covering the basics. While it has primarily confirmed our point of view that fire is truly a wonderful cleansing tool for heresy, we have refined a few of our techniques for using it in the heat of battle. Apparently, there are ways for mages to channel more of their magic without additional strain, mainly through utilizing an additional, small groove within the horn's structure.\n\nMage Redbolt determined this after testing for a few hours on subjects. Some would call that an excessive loss of life. We would prefer to refer to it as saving on cemetery space."

The design of a firearm, although perhaps improved with new chambers, faster hammers, and more effective spring mechanisms for the chamber feed, has not been drastically altered within the last few decades. Projects that aim to further improve upon what has already been nearly perfected appear fruitless.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that they shouldn't be implemented.\n\nFor the duration of the experiment process, Mage Strongarm has been granted the exclusive use of some of the Militarium's firing ranges, after strong petitioning to Archmage Pinpoint. A number of soldiers were hoofpicked by her to be used in these tests. After some initial hiccups and holdups with production from a private manufacturer for the new weapons, the first live rounds were commenced.\n\nAccording to Mage Strongarm, the results were promising within the first wave, after all heretic test subjects were killed in her first examination on whether cobalt-laced bullets could more effectively convince a heretic of their error. None lived long enough to recant, as not only did they bleed out, they already showed signs of early cancers developing within their bloodstreams.\n\nFurther experiments are attached in the accompanying folder, but a high-level overview is this: "dragon's breath" rounds, depleted uranium bullets, active plutonium bullets, and hollow-point rounds. The latter is filled with sulfuric acid. Additionally, half of the soldiers used have reported some hair loss and bleeding from gums from short exposure to the uranium rounds, but have been treated and are now healthy.\n\nMage Strongarm has passed along her belief that the results speak for themselves.\n\nAdditionally find attached the waiver to sign regarding the sealing off of the Solaris Militarium training grounds in Hayseed Swamps. No relation to the research conducted."

For instance, why do noses squeak when they are pressed? What determined the existence of a cutie mark? When is it appropriate for locking horns in public? Do horn extensions actually accomplish their goals?\n\nHowever, those topics remain to be answered, as to limit project scope, Guardian was confined to the physiology and endurance of earth ponies, as well as studying brain patterns and behavioral markers. Since earth ponies maintain much of the industry and agriculture of Equus, it is imperative that they not fall to heresy, which has been observed time and again.\n\nAlong with an earth pony's inherent connection to nature, they are known for their durability, which is why they make up the bulk of conscripts within the Militarium.\n\nThrough extensive and thorough research, involving rigorous tests such as firing pistols into their flanks, withers, and shoulders at point-blank and observing results, there have been some fascinating conclusions. Earth ponies, through their natural magic, have far more complex and reinforced musculature. This takes nutrients away from some cognitive development, it is theorized, which may indicate why they form villages so readily. Frequently, those settlements can go rogue.\n\nWhile this bears further research, the results from the musculature studies have been fruitful. They have interlocking fibers non-standard from other pony races, and protein chains that are longer and closer together. Along with some magic, this allows them to maintain incredible feats for longer, and take wounds that would down others.\n\nSome of the striations have been applied to our tanks, which, while making them heavier, has the added benefit of rebounding bullets and small warheads better than old methods. Acceptable, given the amount of severance pay that the Militarium has had to provide to the test subjects."

  militem.pinpoint.903.d:0 "Since the era of the Three Tribes, pegasi have been the predominant military race on Equus, which has caused some contention within the Empire as it transitioned to unicorn dominance. Pegasi have always been a proud and independent breed, and frequently have been found working with earth ponies against the God-Empress. This begs the question: why are they more individualistic, if they came from the same lineage as the other races?\n\nWhy must they preen their wings in public? What behooves them to act more like birds on occasion than ponies?\n\nGiven that pegasi dominate the air, even after the airplane's introduction, there are a number of inquisitors who believe that the freedom they retain while flying leads to heretical thought. Certainly, without a constant provision of proper guidance from the Adoratio, a pony is more likely to fall prey to incorrect or blasphemous beliefs.\n\nTo this end, since there has been an influx of heretics of pegasi stock since we have regained control of the peninsula, it was a simple enough matter to experiment upon. \n\nMage Cyclone volunteered to lead the project, citing specific interests in the pegasi form and applications to aeronautics. Her recent findings have been rather discouraging, as the kinetic application tests involving trebuchets and impacting heretics into the ground has proven fruitless. Additional experiments regarding wing-clipping, waterboarding, and preening denial have also turned into dead ends, as the heretics, despite losing their one factor that could explain their willful heresy, have remained steadfast in their defiance.\n\nHowever, it has not been for naught, as Mage Cyclone has included diagrams on improving fuselages to match pegasi forms more accurately. Additionally, she has requested artillery cannons for a final kinetic test. Waiver for inevitable repairs have been enclosed."

Despite the strongest potential connection to the Empress, there are a number of unicorns who have or will fall away into heresy, which raises the question: why?\n\nSolving a conundrum that potentially involves many of the chosen of Daybreaker within the Cultus complicates things. Additionally, unicorn heretics are more difficult to apprehend, due to an increased risk of magical mishap. When studied, the magic within a unicorn also inhibits readings, and if not properly protected against, can lead to explosive complications.\n\nInitial theories around certain heretics having specific genetics around horns, specifically those that were shorter or with slightly deviant direction or curvature, could have been at risk of falling to heresy. However, that was soon rectified when one of the inquisitors on the research team left after the first dissection. She was test subject number three.\n\nLater proposals changed from studying heresy to instead looking at ways to improve the spell matrices that power many of our technologies. In a rudimentary way, they mimic the interior veins and ley lines within a unicorn's horn. Through studying it, potential efficiencies can be found.\n\nAnd found they were.\n\nBy inducing a few additional runes within a matrix, it can mimic how magic is steadied by redundant arteries within a unicorn's horn, allowing for further power in machines. A practical application has been in our warships' targeting computers, which require a tremendous draw of energy to effectively predict target locations.\n\nAdditionally, the matrices involved may have developed quirks. It is recommended that captains refuse to listen to pleas for death, suggestions for firing upon friendly ships, or anything regarding knowledge of Princess Celestia. Alcohol is encouraged if stress becomes a problem."

  MTS_heretic_test_subjects_category:0 "Project Hereticus"
  MTS_heretic_test_subjects_category_desc:0 "§RHeresy§! has been rampant in the Solar Empire and its rightful territories for decades and the Inquisitionis has yet to destroy it, no matter how much the Empress or the Lady Inquisitor have strived. Clearly, there is something deficient within the population of Equus itself that drives them to defile Daybreaker's holy land. As a pony of knowledge, §YArchmage Pinpoint§! has dedicated herself to ridding this blight from the land through other, more invasive means than simple burnings. She will eliminate heresy at its source: the very minds of the ponies themselves!\n\nIn our quest to eradicate heresy, we will require many test subjects. We must acquire as many as we can find, so that we may study them and what behooves them to defy the Empress while they are utilized to further our research and weaponry. Taking from our own lands is safer but will be less efficient, while taking from our neighbors is riskier, but should allow us a wider selection of subjects to test on.\n\nCurrent Test Subjects: £manpower_texticon [?global.MTS_heretic_prisoners]\n\nRaid Status: [GetRaidStatus]"

  MTS_adapt_adrenal_responses:0 "Test Adrenal Modifications"
  MTS_trial_stimulant_meal_plans:0 "Trial Stimulant Meal Plans"
  MTS_project_sunrise:0 "Project Sunrise"
  MTS_project_sunrise_desc:0 "It has never been explicitly stated why fire is the appropriate way to cleanse heresy. Using all that fuel and magical energy could be better served elsewhere in the Inquisitionis. Unless, of course, there is some merit to the idea. This will require some in depth testing."
  MTS_project_kinesis:0 "Project Kinesis"
  MTS_project_kinesis_desc:0 "Mage Strongarm has proposed that various kinetic and ballistic tests be performed on heretics to see if we could figuratively punch the heresy out of ponies. Although it is unlikely to succeed in its stated purpose, there is still merit in how to more efficiently end a heretic's life in this research."
  MTS_project_guardian:0 "Project Guardian"
  MTS_project_guardian_desc:0 "Earth ponies are the most common of the three pony races and also the most durable and conservative. Many have sworn fealty to the Empress, but many more are likely to fall to heresy and rebellion within their lifetime, even if they were not born before the Empress ascended. This requires additional probing."
  MTS_project_mage:0 "Project Mage"
  MTS_project_mage_desc:0 "Unicorns are the most blessed of all of Daybreaker's subjects, but there are still an alarming number of suspected heretics within their ranks. Many of the means by which magic flows through a unicorn's horn are unknown. Could there possibly be a link between certain horn phenotypes and heresy?"
  MTS_project_aero:0 "Project Aero"
  MTS_project_aero_desc:0 "Since the invention of the airplane, machines and pegasi have been at strict odds with each other, although the pegasi still had the upper hoof in agility and flight efficiency. With many of our subjects being pegasi, it is best if we dig into their secrets. Free thoughts while flying could lead to heresy."
  MTS_project_hereticus_start:0 "Begin Project Hereticus"
  MTS_project_hereticus_start_desc:0 "After diving into the deepest and darkest secrets of pony physiology and psychology, Archmage Pinpoint has determined that most of her research can be applied to the primary problem: heresy. There will be tremendous expenditure of heretics, but when we finally abolish heresy, the Empress will surely reward us all."
  MTS_project_hereticus_continued:0 "Further Fuel for Hereticus"
  MTS_project_hereticus_continued_desc:0 "Thus far the results of Project Hereticus have been sparse, but that does not mean that we can stop now. There are still many more avenues that we can pursue in our quest. One of them will surely pay off."
  MTS_project_hereticus_finale:0 "Uncover the Mysteries of Heresy"
  MTS_project_hereticus_finale_desc:0 "The labs have run red with blood. We have ended the lives of heretics too numerous to count and exhausted almost all possibilities on how to eradicate heresy permanently. The time to contemplate the death inherent in this project will come at a future point. For now, we must finish the last few threads before declaring victory. Or defeat."

  MTS_investing_in_ourselves_category_desc:0 "The South-Eastern peninsula has an abundance of resources and population to work with. Decades ago under Equestria, the region provided much of the aluminum that powered the fledgeling air industry, but the jungles held rubber and oil untapped. Dedicating ourselves to improving the situation of everypony through new tasks will pay off massively down the line, so long as we can invest the political clout to do so."
  MTS_monument_to_the_fallen:0 "Monument to the Fallen"
  MTS_monument_to_the_fallen_desc:0 "We must never forget the brave soldiers who died to secure the peninsula for all of us. Monuments to their journey will guide ponies to Daybreaker and their souls in the afterlife."

  MTS_labors_triumphal_work_desc:0 "The workers of Stableside are harder to control than some of the other cities. By giving them a grand project on which to work, we can slowly warm them to the ideals of Solarism while improving the status of their region as a whole."
  MTS_dignify_the_holy_canter:0 "Dignify [?3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]"
  MTS_dignify_the_holy_canter_desc:0 "With [?3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] under our control, we can repair the damage that was wrought when we had to forcefully take it in our war of survival. This holy site must be guarded and revered, which will have the greatest plans that our architects can design."
  MTS_the_great_leap:0 "The Great Leap Forward"
  MTS_the_great_leap_desc:0 "Since we have toppled COBSOC, we have made long strides in equalizing our industrial base with the other continental powers, but it is still not enough. There will be sacrifices, but we must rapidly industrialize the peninsula to remain on equal footing with others."
  MTS_farming_modernisation:0 "Farming Modernization"
  MTS_farming_modernisation_desc:0 "Many of the airable land that we have in the peninsula is still traditionally worked. This was something that COBSOC either couldn't or wouldn't change, and if we want to keep a healthy populace, we must finally bring modern techniques to everypony."

  MTS_modernized_railroad:0 "Modernized Railroads"
  MTS_modernized_railroad_desc:0 "Much of the South-East remains disconnected from each other. To prevent fracturing again as well as supplying vital routes to isolated villages, we must start a national railroad program to connecting the country together."
  MTS_healthy_living:0 "Healthy Living"
  MTS_healthy_living_desc:0 "The hospital system throughout the country is an embarrassment, and it's high time that it be resolved so that ponies can actually receive the care they need."
