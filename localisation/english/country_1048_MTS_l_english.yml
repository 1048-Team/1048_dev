  ###Leader Descriptions###
  POLITICS_SCORCHED_EARTH_1048_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: August 2nd, 1009 ALB\n\nScorched Earth grew up in a world where there was no memory of harmony and love between ponies. At the tailwind of the \"Placated Generation,\" all of his earliest memories are nothing but war and suffering, as first changelings, then communists ripped across the battered Equestria and nearly caused its collapse.\n\nIn the first months of the Great War, his family fled from some of the pegasi cloud settlements near the changeling border to the relative safety of the Canterlot region. When Daybreaker ascended, Scorched Earth was little more than a young colt obsessed with the war stories of returning veterans of the "War with the Bugs." In the ensuing years, he enlisted into the rebranded Solaris Militarium and saw action on the front lines against the South-East, whenever incursions from the various communist cells crossed the thin border between the nations.\n\nWorking his way through the ranks, he achieved the position of major after only a few short battles, all of which were ended by decisive, planned action from troops under his command. For a time, he worked with fellow officer Solar Strike to quell some nascent heretics in the central region of the Solar Empire before returning to Ordo Maris to work with its archmage, Ion Trail, and keep the peace. Over time, however, he grew more irritated with the growing decadancy of the Empire, and made no qualms about voicing his displeasure.\n\nWith the advent of the South-East's crumbling and his own assessment that the Solar Empire has become too fat and lazy to effectively accomplish anything, he has taken a page from Solar Strike. Having marched his army of the 7th Glorious Flame and many volunteers who agree with his view on the Solaris Adoratio out of the Empire, he has established a new order in a basecamp in former communist territory.\n\nTrue to his name, Scorched Earth has aggressively subdued the local population, and instituted martial law while destroying much of what has been deemed \"excessive luxury\". With heretics being rounded up in the street daily, life is questionably better under nominal Imperial rule than Cobalt Hoof. However, the entire South-East is his goal, and if it cannot be won, then it can burned to the ground instead."

  ###Unit Leader Traits###
  immovable_furor:0 "Immovable Furor"
  immovable_furor_desc:0 "Faithful to Daybreaker since his youth, Scorched Earth is meticulous yet relentless. With the zealotry of ten Solaris Adoratio priestesses, charges are led from the front into the waiting arms of heretics wishing to embrace their doom. The Solar Empire will be restored. One death at a time."
  
  ###Ideas###
  MTS_unsanctioned_ordo:0 "Unsanctioned Ordo"
  MTS_unsanctioned_ordo_desc:0 "Since we have broken off and ignored directed orders from the God-Empress herself to return to the Solar Empire, our support with our most important neighbors is nonexistent. Only a few Adoratio priestesses have sworn to serve with us, which leaves [MTS.GetLeader]'s reign an unstable one."
  MTS_corrupted_conscripts:0 "Corrupted Conscripts"
  MTS_corrupted_conscripts_desc:0 "Although we have come with an entire legion of soldiers under [MTS.GetLeader]'s command, we still rely on conscripting the masses to maintain enough presence to exert influence in our territory. The communists are unwilling servants, and our auxiliaries are rife with insubordination."
  MTS_ill_adapted_heat_tolerance:0 "Poor Heat Adaptation"
  MTS_ill_adapted_heat_tolerance_desc:0 "The Solar Empire lands are warm, but the Empress's sun is nearly intolerable with the humidity and heat that is trapped in the jungles of the South-East. With the constant threat of malaria and other heat-borne illnesses, our troops are not an effective fighting force."
  MTS_miniscule_industry:0 "Miniscule Industry"
  MTS_miniscule_industry_desc:0 "Outside of New Horseleans, there are no other major industrial centers within [MTS.GetNameDef]. Even working around the clock, our workers struggle to keep up with the industry of other regions, even within the South-East."
