  ###Leader Descriptions###
  POLITICS_SCORCHED_EARTH_1048_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: August 2nd, 1009 ALB\n\n§YBiography§!: Scorched Earth grew up in a world where there was no memory of harmony and love between ponies. At the tailwind of the \"Placated Generation,\" all of his earliest memories are nothing but war and suffering, as first changelings, then communists ripped across the battered Equestria and nearly caused its collapse.\n\nIn the first months of the Great War, his family fled from some of the pegasi cloud settlements near the changeling border to the relative safety of the Canterlot region. When Daybreaker ascended, Scorched Earth was little more than a young colt obsessed with the war stories of returning veterans of the "War with the Bugs." In the ensuing years, he enlisted into the rebranded Solaris Militarium and saw action on the front lines against the South-East, whenever incursions from the various communist cells crossed the thin border between the nations.\n\nWorking his way through the ranks, he achieved the position of major after only a few short battles, all of which were ended by decisive, planned action from troops under his command. For a time, he worked with fellow officer Solar Strike to quell some nascent heretics in the central region of the Solar Empire before returning to Ordo Maris to work with its archmage, Ion Trail, and keep the peace. Over time, however, he grew more irritated with the growing decadancy of the Empire, and made no qualms about voicing his displeasure.\n\nWith the advent of the South-East's crumbling and his own assessment that the Solar Empire has become too fat and lazy to effectively accomplish anything, he has taken a page from Solar Strike. Having marched his army of the 4th Glorious Flame and many volunteers who agree with his view on the Solaris Adoratio out of the Empire, he has established a new order in a basecamp in former communist territory.\n\nTrue to his name, Scorched Earth has aggressively subdued the local population, and instituted martial law while destroying much of what has been deemed "excessive luxury". With heretics routinely executed and all sources of entertainment or relaxation ending up banned, life is questionably better under nominal Imperial rule than Cobalt Hoof. However, subjugating the entire South-East for Daybreaker is Scorched Earth's goal, and if it cannot be won, then it can burned to the ground instead.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: OpalRadiance"
  POLITICS_LUMINOUS_BLADE_DESC:0 ""
  POLITICS_WARM_NIGHT_DESC:0 "§yBorn§!: July 21st, 1014 ALB\n\nAs a pony who grew up in the worst decade of the Empire's existence, Warm Night has experienced both the lows and highs of life under Daybreaker. Raised in a border town of little influence with the Empire and the eventual South-Eastern Governorate, she was exposed to the propaganda of the Adoratio from an early age, whose purported blessings conflicted with her family's existence.\n\nBeing the eldest daughter in her family, she was left with watching her two younger siblings while her parents toiled for hours supporting the Militarium's supply routes as the Empire fought for control of the South-Eastern peninsula. When one of the branches of the Adoratio opened a church school within the town, she was sent to learn the necessities to help her parents. Instead, a passion was ignited for using the resources of the Adoratio to truly help others, a desire that sometimes conflicted with the requirements of correction within the Order.\n\nDespite consistent disagreements, she received a commission to remain in the region of Mareway, with the intent that she would learn from her superior, Serene Shore, a mellowed fire for aid that would be tempered with the teachings of the Adoratio. After reaching Mareway, she organized different charity events, which while popular with the citizenry, started to breed additional unorthodox or heretical thought within them.\n\nRarely is an Adoratio priestess allowed to deviate far without correction from the Inquisitionis, but with Mareway's relatively unimportant location, her thoughts and ideas continued to grow, which she eventually convinced a number of her fellow priestesses to follow. To her, Daybreaker, being the supreme alicorn that she is, is obligated to help the other ponies with a firm, but gentle hoof that has yet to be displayed. Heresy would surely disappear if ponies followed her out of true love rather than fear.\n\nAs she learned of COBSOC's disastrous policies in the South-East, her heart turned toward its ponies and their eventual liberation. When Serene Shore agreed to support Scorched Earth's expedition as a theological guide, Warm Night soon became his strongest critic of his policies. However, until she is able to apply her own at the head of Militem Solar, what she says is only hot air in the breeze, and it will remain a theory if Solarism can really support everypony, faithful or not."
  POLITICS_PINPOINT_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: February 20th, 1017 ALB\n\nArchmage Pinpoint is a rather obscure inquisitor within the ranks of the Solaris Inquisitionis. Little is known about her beyond her date of birth and the town from which she supposedly was born, and any attempts to delve further have been unsuccessful. Rumors abound based on her sometimes erratic, frequently obsessive behavior that she is one of the fabled and feared gravitars, ponies that can meld gravity itself to their magic's power, that rarely appear within the Empire.\n\nInformation is inconclusive on if she was born in Maretime Bay, and if she was, when she left or when she studied to become an inquisitor. Coincidental evidence of a gravitar born within the town comes from news reports of a family found dead in their house after it virtually imploded in a freak accident. When the Inquisitionis quickly responded, it was deemed a microburst of wind and that all were lost, although reports indicate there was a single child that was never found.\n\nAlthough she infrequently speaks of her achievements, Pinpoint has always been upfront with her passion for study and her unfailing love for Daybreaker. Countless hours of hers have been spent perfecting religious science, straddling the line between heretical progress and research to further glorify the God-Empress. An all-consuming passion, like many inquisitors, is to eradicate heresy, but she wishes to go to the source. A source that she has no idea where it resides.\n\nAs the head researcher of the Militem expedition, she has extensive resources at her command, and her inner circle of likeminded, inquisitive and faithful inquisitors, have kept the nation knowledgeable but pure of corruption. Occasional requests for prisoners for experimentation are but a small price to pay to keep up with neighboring nations.\n\nObsessive, mildly paranoid, and fervently loyal to Daybreaker, Pinpoint has mercilessly decreed that she will be the destroyer of heresy, forever. Whether it can be cured with little damage to ponies remains to be seen. But that is only the cost of unwavering, undying love for the immortal God-Empress."

  MTS_expand_plantations_desc:0 "The Hayseed Swamps we own hold an enormous amount of unused rubber, and we only manage a few plantations to extract from it. By expanding these facilities, we ensure our rubber economy flourishes and supports the Empress's tireless crusade in the South-East."
  MTS_required_luxuries:0 "Required Luxuries"
  MTS_required_luxuries_desc:0 "In an ideal world, nopony would require anything outside of the love of the Empress and serving her, however, the ungrateful masses that we have inherited have a certain "acceptable level" of living standards that, at this point, they still demand of us. If it will keep them from completely revolting, then perhaps we can provide a few trinkets."
  MTS_mechanic_machines:0 "Mechanics of the Machine"
  MTS_mechanic_machines_desc:0 "As cogs turn and gears grind, we master the mechanics of the industrial machine. With precision and expertise, we orchestrate the symphony that empowers the Empress's dominion to function flawlessly."
  MTS_redefining_expectations:0 "Redefining Expectations"
  MTS_redefining_expectations_desc:0 "At one time, ponies within the South-East believed that they could have all manner of luxuries. An extra set of clothes, some fresh nuts, or even two bars of soap at a time. These are all spurious, and by retooling our industry to more efficiently work on less, we can slowly fix their living standard issues."
  MTS_wandering_tutors:0 "Wandering Sisters"
  MTS_wandering_tutors_desc:0 "Although we have only a small number of Solaris Adoratio priestesses, we must utilize them to the best of our ability. Their leader, Priestess Serene Shore, has agreed that some of her own will be dispatched to travel around the villages and towns, providing the first pieces of true knowledge in the Empress's salvation, and priming them for learning in future waves of education."
  MTS_answering_needy:0 "Answering the Needy"
  MTS_answering_needy_desc:0 "Despite everything that we have provided for these needy and obstinate populace, they still clamor for more wants. As we are outnumbered hundreds to one here, some concessions must be made if we are to stave off complete anarchy, however, these new factories that will provide for them will come with stipulations, which they will agree to, whether they realize it or not."
  MTS_specialize_in_war:0 "Specialize in War"
  MTS_specialize_in_war_desc:0 "Our economy shall specialize in total war, providing the instruments that propel our forces to victory. Every nail and bolt, every weapon and machine, shall serve as a testament to the Empress's indomitable might."
  MTS_generalize_in_war:0 "Generalize in War"
  MTS_generalize_in_war_desc:0 "Our economy shall generalize in war, providing the instruments that will grant us the necessary versatility needed for victory. We shall adapt to various needs, ensuring that every facet of our dominion harmonizes with the Empress's grand design."
  MTS_fund_church_schools:0 "Fund Church Schools"
  MTS_fund_church_schools_desc:0 "Through church schools, we educate the young in Solarist teachings. By investing in knowledge and faith, we ensure future generations perpetuate her reign, securing her legacy even in these heretical lands."
  MTS_work_out_poverty:0 "Work Them out of Poverty"
  MTS_work_out_poverty_desc:0 "In the end, the only reason so many are poor within our nation is because of sheer laziness. COBSOC allowed them breaks, gave them time for which they could become slothful. We shall not be lenient. If ponies wish to earn the Empress's provision, they must toil for it, and dedicate their lives to her alone."
  MTS_worthwhile_riches:0 "Worthwhile Riches"
  MTS_worthwhile_riches_desc:0 "There are obscene amounts of natural resources within even our own small slice of the South-East, enough that most of it can be diverted to the military while still providing pittance for our citizens in order to keep them placated. Appointing a few overseers will ensure that lots are doled out fairly, and since they are all from our own ranks, should be immune to corruption."
  MTS_like_any_other:0 "Like Any Other"
  MTS_like_any_other_desc:0 "In the grand tapestry of economies, ours shines like any other. Yet, it is the Empress's hoof that guides our efforts, weaving her influence into every transaction and endeavor. With her blessings, we can fully prosper."
  MTS_no_more_optional_tithes:0 "No More Optional Tithes"
  MTS_no_more_optional_tithes_desc:0 "If we are to ever succeed in our conquest of the South-East, and perhaps even beyond the peninsula, we must vastly increase our income that we receive from our citizens. Although the Adoratio and Cultus are mostly outside of [MTS.GetLeader]'s influence, agreements can be made where some additional tithes are then given to the military. It will just require everypony to give, without exception."
  MTS_sweat_for_empress:0 "Sweat for the Empress"
  MTS_sweat_for_empress_desc:0 "We shall sweat for the Empress, our labors a testament to our unwavering dedication. Through hard work and industry, we fuel her vision, enabling her dominion to flourish and conquer."
  MTS_thankful_for_sustenance:0 "Thankful for Sustenance"
  MTS_thankful_for_sustenance_desc:0 "It is still mind-boggling that despite all our efforts, ponies still decry us for starving them, for driving them out of house and home. They should be thankful that they are allowed to exist at all, given their heretical history. Perhaps it is time they receive another set of instructions in humility."
  MTS_punch_above:0 "Punch Above Our Size"
  MTS_punch_above_desc:0 "We shall go even further to punch above our size, our industry defying limitations. Through ingenuity and faith, we will amplify our efforts, demonstrating that in the Empress's realm, no challenge is insurmountable."
  MTS_theology_for_masses:0 "Theology for the Masses"
  MTS_theology_for_masses_desc:0 "Theology for the masses empowers our faith, and therefore our intelligence. By disseminating the Empress's teachings, we fortify belief and solidarity, ensuring her divine influence surely resonates throughout our own dominion."
  MTS_tepid_health:0 "Tepid Health"
  MTS_tepid_health_desc:0 "We nurture tepid health, ensuring our people's well-being. A healthy dominion thrives, and by securing the physical and spiritual welfare of our citizens, we strengthen the Empress's dominion by guaranteeing a healthy and content population."
  MTS_forge_of_empires:0 "A Forge of Empires"
  MTS_forge_of_empires_desc:0 "Our dominion becomes a forge of empires, where industry melds with destiny. Through our labor and dedication, we become a country of smiths, shaping a realm that embodies the Empress's indomitable will."
  
  ###Opening###
  MTS_siege_new_horseleans:0 "The Siege of New Horseleans"
  MTS_siege_new_horseleans_desc:0 "We have been repelled by the forces of [BAL.GetNameDef], short many miles from Baltimare. We cannot return to [EQS.GetNameDef] with nothing to show for our insubordination, but we cannot stay wanderers for long. The port city of New Horseleans should prove the perfect spot to establish our new capital."
  MTS_cracking_new_horseleans:0 "Cracking the City"
  MTS_cracking_new_horseleans_desc:0 "Despite [BAL.GetNameDef] abandoning all the heretics in the city, New Horseleans has proven resistant to our attack. However, there are unguarded sections that we can push through, and no matter our losses, we will take this city in the name of the Empress!"
  MTS_cauterize_rebels:0 "Cauterize Those that Resist"
  MTS_cauterize_rebels_desc:0 "Unsurprisingly, the ponies of New Horseleans have not taken well to our occupation. However, we have the deck in our favor, since we hold the weaponry. It's time to use some of the ammunition to make a point, and reduce the number of mouths that will need to be supported later."
  MTS_warning_example:0 "Warn Through Examples"
  MTS_warning_example_desc:0 "There were numerous officers and soldiers who remained in New Horseleans to coordinate the defense, but most of the defenders were untrained ponies who were pressed to fight for their homes. One of Serene Shore's priestesses, Warm Night, advocates that they be spared, but the professionals punished, as a warning for any future rebels that we will not tolerate sedition."
  MTS_permanent_temporary_base:0 "Permanent Temporary Basecamp"
  MTS_permanent_temporary_base_desc:0 "Since New Horseleans is still devastated from our capture and subsequent punishment, there are few suitable locations for our forces to establish themselves. Keeping our troops near the edge of the city will allow quick responses to either unrest or impending attacks. It'll only be temporary, anyway."
  MTS_host_first_service:0 "Host the First Services"
  MTS_host_first_service_desc:0 "Not priestesses of the Adoratio have traveled with us, since the theology of [MTS.GetNameDef] is considered "heterodox," and therefore, not actively encouraged by the fat heads in Sanctum Solar. However, the contingent under Serene Shore have proven amenable to our ideals, and are already starting to instruct the basics of an ascetic lifestyle to the citizens."
  MTS_establish_inquisitor_teams:0 "Establish Inquisitor Teams"
  MTS_establish_inquisitor_teams_desc:0 "Only a few inquisitors dared to defy Lady Inquisitor Quasar Pulse and the Empress to travel with us, but they have already proven instrumental in maintaining order within New Horseleans. Now that resistance is spreading outside the city, it is time for Archmage Pinpoint to organize hunter-seeker groups to eliminate these before they become a threat."
  MTS_crack_down_on_thestrals:0 "Crack Down on Thestrals"
  MTS_crack_down_on_thestrals_desc:0 "As a haven of all things unclean, COBSOC had allowed the greatest insult to the Empress, the thestrals, spread out and settle in different regions. Due to their backward, tribal thinking, they have proven difficult to dislodge, but now that we have an Inquisitionis presence, we can dedicate many resources to wiping them from the face of the peninsula."
  MTS_first_faithful:0 "The First Faithful"
  MTS_first_faithful_desc:0 "Thousands have flocked to the words of Serene Shore and her priestesses and to show their desire to remain in the Empress's good graces, have volunteered to serve with us in an auxiliary capacity. These are untrained and still tainted with heretical ideals, but they could prove useful fodder when we expand to the peninsula."
  MTS_reconstruction_teams:0 "Reconstruction Teams"
  MTS_reconstruction_teams_desc:0 "There are numerous prisoners that have yet to be purified of their crimes. While we wait to uphold justice, we can use them for a benefit: There is much work that must be done to repair New Horseleans, and too few free bodies to do it."
  MTS_flush_out_jungles:0 "Flush Out the Jungles"
  MTS_flush_out_jungles_desc:0 "Some of the fledgeling resistance groups have taken shelter within the thick canopies of Hayseed Swamp and its surrounding jungles, harassing our garrisons that have been established in the largest settlements and otherwise inflicting casualties that we cannot replace. Thankfully, we don't need to actually search for them when burning them out will be just as effective."
  MTS_eliminate_commissars:0 "Eliminate Old Commissars"
  MTS_eliminate_commissars_desc:0 "Although most of the forces of COBSOC fled when the government collapsed, some stayed in the city to organize defenses against any potential attacks or uprising. These commissars are few in number, but hold much influence in fighting-aged ponies, and could prove to be a problem if allowed to live for much longer, which requires that we deal with them. Now."
  MTS_necessary_sacrifices:0 "Necessary Sacrifices"
  MTS_necessary_sacrifices_desc:0 "At the moment, ponies are reluctant to give up what few luxuries they have to focus all they can on the Empress and the prize that is promised in her. They cling to their trinkets and baubles like shiny pearls that will fade in only a short time, hindering our ability to mobilize for war. We must cut them off immediately, so they can learn to survive with what is strictly needed."
  MTS_solar_pressers:0 "Solar Pressers"
  MTS_solar_pressers_desc:0 "There is still much that can be done to shore up our position within the South-East, as we require many more bodies to supplement our forces, but also further development of infrastructure to mobilize for the war effort. Sending gangs of our soldiers into the cities to recruit new ponies will not be popular, but it is something that we must do if we want to survive. They might not, though."
  MTS_labor_for_empress:0 "Labor for the Empress"
  MTS_labor_for_empress_desc:0 "Although they can be used for vain accessories, the region in which we find ourself in is filled to the brim with natural resources that can be put toward our impending war with the other breakaways. However, with limited capacity for modern refining, for now, we will require of our citizens they sacrifice their time to improve our production lines, whether they want to or not."
  MTS_first_step:0 "The First Step"
  MTS_first_step_desc:0 "Now that many are primed for the ideas of [MTS.GetNameDef], it should be only a simple speech that will lead many to realizing the joy of simple lifestyles and training for conflict from Scorched Earth. The reduced strain on our industry will be a boon for reconstruction, as well as the reclaimation that could be done with their trinkets."
  MTS_first_bridge:0 "The First Bridge"
  MTS_first_bridge_desc:0 "To entice more ponies to learn about Daybreaker and her demands, Warm Night has proposed that we establish some community shelters for those most afflicted. Although it won't directly simplify their lifestyle, those that find aid there could be asked to assist with some of the building projects that are planned for the future, with the promise of shelter once done."
  MTS_theological_debates:0 "Theological Debates"
  MTS_theological_debates_desc:0 "The differences between Scorched Earth and Warm Night have reached a boiling. Word has just reached that the priestess is going to confront the General in his quarters. We can only hope that the guards arrive in time."
  
  ###Scorched Earth Pre-War###
  MTS_keeping_simple:0 "Keeping It Simple"
  MTS_keeping_simple_desc:0 "With Warm Night finally backing down on some of her absurd claims, it is time to turn our attention to the most pressing concern of the South-East: toppling the petty warlords and rival governments that have sprung up in the wake of COBSOC's collapse. At least there will be some easy solutions to this rather difficult problem."
  MTS_victory_with_less:0 "Victory with Less"
  MTS_victory_with_less_desc:0 "One of the first things that Scorched Earth requires be instilled to the new drafting base is that just because they will be fighting for the Empress does not mean they will be provided more, better equipment. A cunning warrior will win with what he has, and rely on his faith to get the job done, even if it has to be done with his bare hooves."
  MTS_restructure_poverty:0 "Restructure the Idea of Poverty"
  MTS_restructure_poverty_desc:0 "For decades, the ponies of the South-East were considered some of the most destitute and suffering ponies on all of Equus. However, that is not the case, for while they cry that they have been left to rot and die from lack of necessities, we must inform them that they have been prepared for this blessed moment! By having little, they will learn to be content with even less than before, and praise the Empress in so doing!"
  MTS_wealth_minimalism:0 "Wealth in Minimalism"
  MTS_wealth_minimalism_desc:0 "Architecture, factories, food, and other things do not need to be fancy, gaudy, or expensive to be effective. In fact, the simplest items are usually the most efficient, and in that, there is a wealth of blessings for anypony who looks for them. It's time we give our citizens this vital lesson so they may be prepared for the future."
  MTS_warriors_diet:0 "A Warrior's Diet"
  MTS_warriors_diet_desc:0 "One of the first things that we must do in preparation for conquering this cursed peninsula is get our recruits on a proper diet that they may be focused entirely on the Empress. COBSOC allowed them to grow decadent and fat, eating such nicities as maize or seaweed, when all they need is hay and wheat to survive. And thus, they shall be taught how to have this food, and like it."
  MTS_only_war_possessions:0 "Possesions only for War"
  MTS_only_war_possessions_desc:0 "In the short term, we can simply force our factories and our construction sites to remain prepared for funding the entirety of our liberation of the South-East. Nothing will be made for a pony's enjoyment, for everything will be meant to kill, maim, or eradicate when we march into the jungles of the peninsula."
  MTS_denying_life_rights:0 "Denying the Right to Live"
  MTS_denying_life_rights_desc:0 "The average pony believes that they are entitled to things they call "necessities," but that is something that [MTS.GetLeader] knows is ripe for perversion. Because of this, fasting will soon be implemented across all levels of society so that our new citizens can learn to deny themselves and instead focus on the Empress, like everypony should."
  MTS_forgo_needs:0 "Forgo Simple Needs"
  MTS_forgo_needs_desc:0 "Where there were once factories meant for providing basics like clothing and factory protective equipment, they are now being tooled into forges for the little requirements of an army. Boots, holsters, and other needs for a soldier will be met, but even then, they will be the minimum that is required to function, lest our own soldiers get haughty and think themselves above the Empress."
  MTS_everything_for_warrior:0 "Tool Everything for a Warrior's Hooves"
  MTS_everything_for_warrior_desc:0 "Many of the tool factories for farms or the Celestial Sea fisheries can be temporarily diverted to construct weapons for our warriors. The ensuing derth of civilian materials is no concern of ours, as they will learn to trust the Empress more to keep them alive in the wake of owning less."
  MTS_warriors_calling:0 "A Warrior's Calling"
  MTS_warriors_calling_desc:0 "Just like everypony is called to be a servant of the Empress outside of war, everypony within [MTS.GetNameDef] is called to be a warrior of the highest caliber, ready to sacrifice themselves on the battlefield in her name. Although that is the ideal, it is clear that the ponies of the South-East have grown soft from their luxuries, and we should focus on select demographics to induct into the military."
  MTS_sacrifice_everything:0 "Sacrifice is Everything"
  MTS_sacrifice_everything_desc:0 "In the perfect society, everypony will abstain from anything that could distract from the Empress. Whether that be food, clothing, housing, or even baser needs, all should be given up in service to the Empress. However, a majority of the populace isn't ready for that yet, but a select few have fully embraced our teachings, and are ready to charge into the midst of battles as our greatest shock troops."
  MTS_reconsider_extremes:0 "Reconsider the Extremes"
  MTS_reconsider_extremes_desc:0 "While it would be proper for every citizen to learn what it means to truly live with reliance on the Empress's mercy, there simply isn't enough time to properly train and prepare them, especially for some of the holiest and extreme ceremonies. For now, as suggested by Mage Luminous Blade, we shall drip-feed them theology, and they shall one day be ready."
  MTS_sanity_not_included:0 "Sanity not Included"
  MTS_sanity_not_included_desc:0 "Although many outside of [MTS.GetNameDef] would decry us as insane for our practices, they merely have been blinded by the temptations of this world. Even our very bodies can be an avenue for both sin and hedonism, so we must therefore purge any thoughts from us from time to time. There are ceremonies that are perfect for it, no matter how bloody..."
  MTS_poverty_is_a_concept:0 "Poverity is a Concept"
  MTS_poverty_is_a_concept_desc:0 "While our citizens continue to complain to us about how they have been slowly falling further into poverty, they have yet to realize, despite our instructions, that being poor is merely a state of mind. For if somepony is rich in spirit and love for the Empress, then they are rich indeed, no matter what sinful material possessions they have. For now, though, we shall humor them."
  MTS_retool_hedonism:0 "Retool Hedonistic Forges"
  MTS_retool_hedonism_desc:0 "As New Horseleans is the capital of the region of which we conquered, it is the major industrial center for this area of the South-Eastern Peninsula and therefore has many factories dedicated to keeping the citizenry placated and mentally blinded from the Empress. We shall not, though, completely demolish them all, for some could prove useful to our cause against [BAL.GetNameDef]."
  MTS_simply_war:0 "It's Simply War"
  MTS_simply_war_desc:0 "Despite our small numbers and our relatively "basic" military, we are blessed by the God-Empress herself, and our holy warriors will march across the peninsula to clear and cleanse it from all unrighteousness. Any that don't will be purged themselves."
  MTS_simply_society:0 "It's Simply Society"
  MTS_simply_society_desc:0 "While there are many steps that are still required, General Earth has successfully brought ponies on the path toward ascending to a new level with the Empress, by sacrificing all that they own to better themselves and hear the very word of the Empress. There is still much wealth and luxury in the nation, but it is a start."
  MTS_simply_economy:0 "It's Simply the Economy"
  MTS_simply_economy_desc:0 "Through our simplifying and restructing of the industrial base in New Horseleans and the surrounding region, we have turned the sluggish and sinful economy of COBSOC into a weapon that will plunge into the very heart of [BAL.GetLeader], and we shall see [BAL.GetLeader.GetHerHim] bleed!"
  MTS_introduce_holy_napalm:0 "Introduction to Holy Napalm"
  MTS_introduce_holy_napalm_desc:0 "A particular favorite tactic of General Earth, utilizing Holy Napalm to cleanse entire battlefields is a tried and true concept, that unfortunately we were unable to capitalize on when we first invaded the South-East. Now that we have a stronger production base, we can guarantee a constant supply of the holy weapon, and we shall see the peninsula burnt to ash around us!"
  MTS_spread_ascetic_inquisitor:0 "Spread the Ascetic Inquisitor Concept"
  MTS_spread_ascetic_inquisitor_desc:0 "Since we have a number of inquisitors that left with us, we should lean further upon their support. While Mage Luminous Blade already followed General Earth's teachings, and even helped establish them, there are other inquisitors who need further instruction. From there, we can spread the word throughout the nation, and streamline the Inquisitionis's function within and without in their hunt for heresy."
  MTS_wise_rejection:0 "Wise Rejection"
  MTS_wise_rejection_desc:0 "It appears that our instructions have finally started to bear fruit, as more ponies are growing disinterested in attending their heathen public schools - which were mostly destroyed anyway - and learning directly from the Adoratio. Already, literacy and understanding in basic theology is improving, and we can hope for properly well-educated citizens within a few years."
  MTS_require_charity:0 "Require Adoratio Charity" #Maybe change this to mandatory Adoratio time ministering to the soldiers
  MTS_require_charity_desc:0 "In order to properly evangelize the nation, the Solaris Adoratio requires a certain amount of money, as much as we are loath to admit it, which has been still been hard to come by since we arrived here. Ponies, in general, are not willing to part with their filthy lucre to give the Adoartio their proper dues. But who said that the request had to be optional?"
  MTS_lean_as_possible:0 "As Lean as Can be"
  MTS_lean_as_possible_desc:0 "By applying some of the concepts that we used in improving the industrial base of New Horseleans, we can further cut down cruft and inefficiencies in our supply lines. A few incentives here and there by properly... encouraging loyalty will go a long way to those who wish to keep their safety net within [MTS.GetNameDef]."
  MTS_unleash_empresss_wrath:0 "Unleash the Empress's Wrath"
  MTS_unleash_empresss_wrath_desc:0 "We have built [MTS.GetNameDef] into a single weapon with a sole purpose: eradicating the heresy and hedonism that resides on this peninsula. It is time that we remind them all why the Empress should never be crossed."
  
  ###Scorched Earth Post-War non-opulence###
  MTS_southeastern_triumph:0 "South-Eastern Triumph!"
  MTS_southeastern_triumph_desc:0 "With the final surrender of the remaining South-Eastern holdouts, we have claimed this peninsula for the Empress and restored a large section of the Empire that was lost for decades! May the souls of our fallen brethen be honored this day by the purging of all heresy from the South-East!"
  MTS_warriors_commitment:0 "Warriors Without Commitments"
  MTS_warriors_commitment_desc:0 "While our soldiers fought valiantly, it is undeniable that the ponies that we conscripted to sacrifice for the Empress have yet to closely embrace the teachings of General Earth. Many still hold to family, friends, or whatever few possessions they still have, and we must instill in them a higher calling."
  MTS_organized_expectations:0 "Organized Expectations"
  MTS_organized_expectations_desc:0 "We did haphazardly construct much of our military's regimen after we stablized New Horseleans, since the time we had to capitalize on [BAL.GetNameDef]'s weakness was limited. This has led to much confusion in our ranks on what constitutes adequately ascetic. It is time we set a baseline for them to achieve, before we go further."
  MTS_harsher_expectations:0 "Harsher Expectations"
  MTS_harsher_expectations_desc:0 "Since we did not have proper time to instruct all of the tenets of Militem Solar when we first conscripted many of our recruits, they have already backslidden into lax, hedonistic practices, such as food breaks! We must double-down on every aspect of being a soldier for the Empress, no matter unpopular."
  MTS_march_on_nothing:0 "Marching on Nothing"
  MTS_march_on_nothing_desc:0 "As we are all servants of the Empress, we must all learn how to be happy with nothing, if she so deems it. It is doubly important for a soldier of [MTS.GetNameDef] to be content no matter their situation, and therefore, we will start to drill them with the strictest of expectations for readiness at a moment's notice."
  MTS_lessons_of_jungle:0 "Lessons of the Jungle"
  MTS_lessons_of_jungle_desc:0 "Before we reconquered the South-East, tactics revolving around jungle warfare had been over two decades old, which left us woefully unprepared for anything that the communists or thestrals would throw at us. Thankfully, through grit and blood, we have adapted to some of the realities of this peninsula, and our doctrinces have benefited."
  MTS_luxurious_pain:0 "Pain is a Luxury"
  MTS_luxurious_pain_desc:0 "Most of our recruits from this subcontinent have pathetic tolerance for hardship. They don't realize that even the very pain they feel as they bleed, as they are sacrificed to the Empress, is a blessing, for that is the only way they truly know they are alive. Some further trials will instill the respect of agony that they need."
  MTS_discipline_succeeds:0 "Discipline will Succeed"
  MTS_discipline_succeeds_desc:0 "Although our troops could still stand to further sacrifice anything for the Empress, they have already been strictly drilled and instructed, so that they may one day fully embrace the loss that the Empress requires of us. Even under a hail of bullets, they will never break or fall back."
  MTS_theatre_of_learning:0 "Theater of Learning"
  MTS_theatre_of_learning_desc:0 "We have an ideal backyard for specializing our troops in various theaters of war. From the deep jungles to the soaring mountain ranges, our soldiers will know how to fight in every condition and carry the Empress's will to the ends of Equus!"
  MTS_zealotry_will_win:0 "Zealotry will Triumph"
  MTS_zealotry_will_win_desc:0 "Through effort and stringent punishment, our recruits are finally beginning to accept that they are nothing without the Empress. Every breath they take, every move they make, is only permitted by her will. If we march again against the enemies of Daybreaker, they will crush everycreature beneath her unwavering hoof!"
  MTS_empress_unachieved:0 "What the Empress Couldn't Achieve"
  MTS_empress_unachieved_desc:0 "It is undeniable that the South-East lay as a stain upon the Empress's record as one of the greatest indignity that was ever suffered by the Empire. For all her promises, she never sought to retake this land, which leaves General Earth with a great claim: accomplishing something that the Empress was incapable of doing herself. Truly, he is one of the greatest military leaders of our time!"
  MTS_remove_want:0 "Removing All Want"
  MTS_remove_want_desc:0 "Our civilian industry, while small, is still hungry for resources that are rightfully meant only for the Empress's finest. While some cry out for more aid to meet their demands, we shall answer with less, until everypony accepts that they only need the Empress's love."
  MTS_simplified_forges:0 "Simplified Forges"
  MTS_simplified_forges_desc:0 "Asceticism need not only be applied to the lives of our citizens in what they use themselves. Many nations have a pointless series of guidelines that they call a building code, which are nothing more than ways to prevent the most practical designs from being used to save on time wasted that could be spent producing for the Empress. Eliminating this will further augment our weapon yields with more forges."
  MTS_metals_galore:0 "Metals Galore"
  MTS_metals_galore_desc:0 "There is an uncountable amount of metal used in fruitless things like kitchen utensils or other luxuries as bedframes or similar items that many of our citizens have within the nation. However, those resources could be better used for the production of weapons, so that we do not have to scrape for every piece of iron that must be refined into steel. It's not like any of the beforementioned items are needed, anyway."
  MTS_ceaseless_lines:0 "Ceaseless Lines"
  MTS_ceaseless_lines_desc:0 "While the idea of sacrificing sleep to get something done is not new, it will be enforced to ensure that our production lines remain constantly at work. Ponies should consider it a blessing and a luxury if they are allowed to return home after a full, twenty-four hour day of labor, since the Empress herself never rests from protecting us. It is the least they can do to afford her the same service."
  MTS_want_not_waste_not:0 "Want not Waste not"
  MTS_want_not_waste_not_desc:0 "While we have sapped most of the small items from our citizens and used them for more practical purposes, there are still larger vehicles, machinery, or the like that are needless when ponies could simply rely on the Empress instead. However, these provide opportunity for us to further improve our independence from natural resources, as we slowly recycle anything and everything that we can."
  MTS_utilize_last_as_chattel:0 "Utilize the Last as Chattel"
  MTS_utilize_last_as_chattel_desc:0 "Many of the abominable thestrals were killed in our conquest of the South-East, yet not all of them were eliminated in fire. Our prisons are filled with the vile creatures, and while standard procedure would be to burn them all to cleanse the world of their taint, there is nothing preventing us from utilizing for more pragmatic purposes. Utilizing them could begin their repentance early."
  MTS_pure_government:0 "A Pure Government"
  MTS_pure_government_desc:0 "Until now, there were still a number of bureaucrats who worked in COBSOC running the nation. Not all of them were rabidly loyal to his ideals, and were happy to turn to the Empress, or at least feign love for her. However, their minds are still corrupt, and we must make every effort to fill our ranks with likeminded ponies from General Earth's general staff, lest the risk of a COBSOC coup ever become a reality."
  MTS_thankless_job:0 "A Thankless Job"
  MTS_thankless_job_desc:0 "Like all inquisitors, Mage Luminous Blade has tirelessly worked to keep the Empire and the Empress safe from any heretical threats; but on top of that, she has pledged herself to be Scorched Earth's lifelong guard, so that his mission will succeed. While all of the Empire's inquisitors deserve thanks, she above all, needs some acknowledgement of her sacrifice, especially in the wake of her war injuries."
  MTS_vexations:0 "Vexations"
  MTS_vexations_desc:0 "General Earth has been having... thoughts, as of late. He has been more reclusive and uppity, and there is little explanation why. Since his private meeting with Mage Blade, he has gone out of his way to avoid spending much time with her, or denying her his person to guard. Hopefully the general leaves his funk soon and can return to his normal performance."
  MTS_goddesss_light:0 "The Goddess's Light"
  MTS_goddesss_light_desc:0 "According to the general, his mind has yet to be put at ease with whatever is troubling it. Nopony has been told who, what, or why he had such a shift in personality, although a few wonder if he has been hexed by Discord or a vengeful thestral. It appears he will be seeking aid, as he has recently departed for the Cultus's primary church in New Baltimare, where he can hopefully get aid."
  MTS_quiet_contemplation:0 "Quiet Contemplation"
  MTS_quiet_contemplation_desc:0 "Since his last visit to the Adoratio's church, the General Earth has been far less jumpy, although whatever cure the priestesses have provided appear to have left him absentminded or foggy. Already, it is getting better, though, and he has promised after the next visit to the church, he will be right as rain. In a way, he seems almsot happier."
  MTS_show_meal:0 "Meal and a Show"
  MTS_show_meal_desc:0 "As there are a number prisoners and heretics who have yet to be properly judged and punished, General Earth - who has since been refreshed from the priestesses' assistance in his mysterious ailment - has decreed that the remainder will be brought forth to be punished. He has requested less security, however, stating that Mage Blade will keep him safe. He did appear rather flustered when he mentioned her."
  MTS_not_so_ascetic:0 "Not So Ascetic After All"
  MTS_not_so_ascetic_desc:0 "It cannot be confirmed, but rumors are circulating that there is something more to the relationship that General Earth and Mage Blade now share. Nopony dares ask either of them, however, so it will remain unclear unless one of them admits to their crime of abandonment of the Empress's calling. Whatever happened, they work better now than ever before."
  MTS_legitimize_militem:0 "Legitimizing [MTS.GetNameDef]"
  MTS_legitimize_militem_desc:0 "Many of our beliefs are in contention within the Empire itself, as the primary church in Sanctum Solar has not sanctioned most of what Scorched Earth holds to be true. However, we are not heretics, as we still hold to the same tenets as the rest of our brothers and sisters. Now that we have liberated the South-East for the Empress, Sunset Shimmer must surely welcome us back with open arms."
  MTS_to_be_saved:0 "To be Saved"
  MTS_to_be_saved_desc:0 "Everypony should be at least shown the way to salvation from their sins, even if most will never achieve because of their love of filthy lucre and other forms of hedonistic thought. Through some careful preaching from the Adoratio, we should be able to craft a slightly better image of us to the citizenry, and then lay the groundwork for future ascetic lifestyles."
  MTS_to_be_holier:0 "To be Holier"
  MTS_to_be_holier_desc:0 "It is a requirement of everypony to be as holy as the Empress herself, although all of us fail. However, it is clear that the general citizenry of the South-East are incapable of remaining loyal or loving to the Empress, which means that we will have to herd them until they are incinerated for their sins. The zealous among us will chafe to enact this policy, especially if we bring the light to further nations."
  MTS_loss_is_gain:0 "Loss is Gain"
  MTS_loss_is_gain_desc:0 "Ponies hold far too strong attachments to the things that they own. They have yet to realize that all goods are gifts from the Empress, and that because she provides them, she can just as easily take them away. Therefore, the ascetic lifestyle is ideal, as it sacrifices all possible to give back to her, and it maintains low needs, so that if things are lost, they cause little pain. If only more saw it that way."
  MTS_simple_means_easy:0 "Simple means Easy"
  MTS_simple_means_easy_desc:0 "As there is a truthfully self-inflicted housing crisis within the nation, we require a quick and easy method for us to rebuild and house those that were displaced. We do this not out of a kindness of our heart, for they should all be happy living where they are, but we do this out of necessity, lest more unrest begins to foment. One day, these will be torn down, just as easily as they are erected."
  MTS_singular_focus:0 "Singular Focus"
  MTS_singular_focus_desc:0 "As the brightest torch of the Empress, all of [MTS.GetNameDef] should be ready to fight and die for her and the Empire. Leave the worries of the afterlife, the economy, the farms, to other ponies, for we will be the sword that strikes directly into the heart of the Empress's enemies and our inquisitors the fire that melts away all heresy!"
  MTS_suffering_life_and_next:0 "Suffering in Both Lives"
  MTS_suffering_life_and_next_desc:0 "Although it is unlikely to truly reward them with eternal salvation, by promising our citizens that they will more likely be heard in prayer or given preference in death by denying their loves of money, things, spouse, or child, they should become willing to charge into the lines of enemy fire. Already, these messages have struck some chords, as our recruitment numbers are up. A new generation of servants await!"
  MTS_sanctification_mission:0 "Missions of Sanctification"
  MTS_sanctification_mission_desc:0 "By appealing to some of the aspects of the primary church in Sanctum Solar, we can encourage our followers and our priestesses to serve primarily in spreading the word of Daybreaker's salvation, and giving guidelines on sanctification. These may be different from Sanctum Solar, but they are still within orthodoxy, and should give us a legitimacy in the rest of the Empire."
  MTS_punishment_mission:0 "Missions of Punishment"
  MTS_punishment_mission_desc:0 "As the representative of Daybreaker, it is our mission to ensure that the heresy is kept minimal and heretics are punished wherever they are discovered. Appealing to the office of Lady Inquisitor in Sanctum Solar, we should encourage all of our loyal troops and Cultus members to further reverence, and legitimize our standing within the eyes of the Empire."
  MTS_minimalist_transcendence:0 "Minimalist Transcendence"
  MTS_minimalist_transcendence_desc:0 "Through extreme self-denial and constant meditation, some of our younger priestesses have offered to commune and learn from Daybreaker more so that we may stay on the right path. Even General Earth views them as a bit excessive, but we can't deny they've given us some insights into how we can utilize ponykind's innate magic further."
  MTS_minimalist_fury:0 "Minimalist Fury"
  MTS_minimalist_fury_desc:0 "As our inquisitors have striven harder, they have denied more of their own needs to ensure the body of the Empire continues to be preserved, nourished, and protected. Even now, their hunger and anger drives them to fight in new and creative ways against the heretics, which has led to an overall boon for our companies in battle."
  MTS_claiming_new_home:0 "Claiming Our New Home"
  MTS_claiming_new_home_desc:0 "With the fall of [BAL.GetNameDef] and the surrender of the other regions, we have asserted our dominance upon the entire peninsula! The prize that awaits us the port city of Baltimare, now such a large megalopolis that a distinct region has been designated for the entirety of COBSOC's government. We now have the capacity to flush out the last resistance here and set ourselves as the official rulers of the land."
  MTS_determining_finest:0 "Determining the Fittest"
  MTS_determining_finest_desc:0 "Among the prisoners, heretics, and abominations, there are many ponies who, while enemies of Daybreaker, could be used for something more than just an example what happens to those who turn their backs from her. We shall set criteria that must be met by the captives. If they are blessed enough by her, they will easily qualify and be rescued from the Holy Flame, only to serve their lives toiling for her."
  MTS_begin_purification:0 "Begin Reign of Purification"
  MTS_begin_purification_desc:0 "Hundreds of thousands of ponies have fled into the jungles and rurual villages, seeking safety from us, since they believe that we will harm them or their way of life. Ironically, it is this very action that have now doomed them. If they stayed in the cities, they would be spared, but now that they harbor with heretics, they will be given the same fate as we cleanse this land with the Holy Flame!"
  MTS_dying_breaths:0 "Use Their Dying Breaths"
  MTS_dying_breaths_desc:0 "Ponies are like resources: they do not last forever. While we still are able to bolster our workerforce through the useful prisoners which we hold, we should aim to rapidly grow our cities and towns to provide a base for crafting the Empress's weapons of war. Many of the captives will likely die in this effort, but when did that ever matter?"
  MTS_discard_waste:0 "Discard the Waste"
  MTS_discard_waste_desc:0 "Of the prisoners that were not deemed worthy of serving the Empress in labor, the rest will be used as either cannon fodder or as examples to those that are still free. Whether they be heretic, abomination, or enemy, they will all provide an identical message: the Empress will be obeyed, no matter the price."
  MTS_flatten_cities:0 "Flatten the Corrupt Cities"
  MTS_flatten_cities_desc:0 "As an ultimate insult to the Empress, the damned thestrals have had cities this entire time, deep in the jungle and near the base of the Scale Mountains! These must have been one of the ways that they have remained so populous and so much a thorn in the Empress's side as creatures of darkness. There is only recourse for their existence, and that is to end it. With fire."
  MTS_burn_jungles:0 "Burn the Jungle to Ash"
  MTS_burn_jungles_desc:0 "A large percentage of the thestral population and a number of communist cells reside in the deep thicket of the peninsula's jungle, which they believe will stymie us in our dedication to eradicate them. While it is a noble goal, they are sorely mistaken on the lengths we'll go to purify this peninsula. If we have to burn down every square inch to see heresy cleansed, so be it!"
  MTS_wide_applications:0 "Wide Applications"
  MTS_wide_applications_desc:0 "The principles that we exercised in sifting through the fit and unfit from ponies that we captured have proven largely successful. Not only have we had many examples to display to dissuade heresy, but we have also created an auxiliary workforce that can be utilized twenty-four-seven. Cementing this principles into law will greatly enhance any of our future conquests, and speed the integration of new lands in the process."
  MTS_holy_justice:0 "Holy Justice on a Grand Scale"
  MTS_holy_justice_desc:0 "As a tried and true method, the use of fire and napalm to cleanse lands of taint and heresy has been proven yet again as we've cleared the South-East of much of its corruption. Considering that General Earth is a proponent of just such policies, it should prove trivial to implement and standardize how future lands are cleaned for our use. It will involve flames. Lots of flames."
  MTS_solar_south_east:0 "A Solar South-East"
  MTS_solar_south_east_desc:0 "With the last of the cells of communists destroyed and the thestrals purified or captured, the South-East is finally within the domain of the Empress again. There will still be unrest, but now those loyal to us will begin the process of healing the nation, and preparing it for the inevitable return into the Empress's embrace directly. Until that day, may we celebrate our efforts together!"
  MTS_pure_peninsula:0 "A Pure Peninsula"
  MTS_pure_peninsula_desc:0 "For decades, the South-East has been a haven for scum, villains, and thestrals, but now that we have brought it back into the fold, we have established this subcontinent as a beacon of light and loyalty for the rest of Equus to see. Our citizens now serve without question, and every day, more flock to the Empress's name that they may be saved. We shall all stand in her might, and we shall walk into her embrace, as one!"
  MTS_return_journey:0 "The Return Journey"
  MTS_return_journey_desc:0 "With the South-East stabilized and an example for all within the Empire, it is time we petition that the Empress hear us, and welcome us back with open arms. General Earth is confident that he will be accepted, and it will only take a short letter for us to finally know of our fate."

Clearly, there is something deficient within the population of Equus itself that drives them to defile Daybreaker's holy land. As a pony of knowledge, §YArchmage Pinpoint§! has dedicated herself to ridding this blight from the land through other, more invasive means than simple burnings. She will eliminate heresy at its source: the very minds of the ponies themselves!\n\nIn our quest to eradicate heresy, we will require many test subjects.

  MTS_project_kinesis:0 "Project Kinesis"
  MTS_project_kinesis_desc:0 "Archmage Light Jolt has proposed that various kinetic and ballistic tests be performed on heretics to see if we could figuratively punch the heresy out of ponies. Although it is unlikely to succeed in its stated purpose, there is still merit in how to more efficiently end a heretic's life in this research."
  MTS_project_guardian:0 "Project Guardian"
  MTS_project_guardian_desc:0 "Earth ponies are the most common of the three pony races and also the most durable and conservative.

This requires additional probing."

  MTS_project_hereticus_start_desc:0 "After diving into the deepest and darkest secrets of pony physiology and psychology, Archmage Pinpoint has determined that most of her research can be applied to the primary problem: heresy.
