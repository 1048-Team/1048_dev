  ###Leader Descriptions###
  POLITICS_SCORCHED_EARTH_1048_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: August 2nd, 1009 ALB\n\nScorched Earth grew up in a world where there was no memory of harmony and love between ponies. At the tailwind of the \"Placated Generation,\" all of his earliest memories are nothing but war and suffering, as first changelings, then communists ripped across the battered Equestria and nearly caused its collapse.\n\nIn the first months of the Great War, his family fled from some of the pegasi cloud settlements near the changeling border to the relative safety of the Canterlot region. When Daybreaker ascended, Scorched Earth was little more than a young colt obsessed with the war stories of returning veterans of the "War with the Bugs." In the ensuing years, he enlisted into the rebranded Solaris Militarium and saw action on the front lines against the South-East, whenever incursions from the various communist cells crossed the thin border between the nations.\n\nWorking his way through the ranks, he achieved the position of major after only a few short battles, all of which were ended by decisive, planned action from troops under his command. For a time, he worked with fellow officer Solar Strike to quell some nascent heretics in the central region of the Solar Empire before returning to Ordo Maris to work with its archmage, Ion Trail, and keep the peace. Over time, however, he grew more irritated with the growing decadancy of the Empire, and made no qualms about voicing his displeasure.\n\nWith the advent of the South-East's crumbling and his own assessment that the Solar Empire has become too fat and lazy to effectively accomplish anything, he has taken a page from Solar Strike. Having marched his army of the 4th Glorious Flame and many volunteers who agree with his view on the Solaris Adoratio out of the Empire, he has established a new order in a basecamp in former communist territory.\n\nTrue to his name, Scorched Earth has aggressively subdued the local population, and instituted martial law while destroying much of what has been deemed \"excessive luxury\". With heretics being rounded up in the street daily, life is questionably better under nominal Imperial rule than Cobalt Hoof. However, the entire South-East is his goal, and if it cannot be won, then it can burned to the ground instead.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: OpalRadiance"

  ###Unit Leader Traits###
  immovable_furor:0 "Immovable Furor"
  immovable_furor_desc:0 "Faithful to Daybreaker since his youth, Scorched Earth is meticulous yet relentless. With the zealotry of ten Solaris Adoratio priestesses, charges are led from the front into the waiting arms of heretics wishing to embrace their doom. The Solar Empire will be restored. One death at a time."
  
  ###Ideas###
  MTS_unsanctioned_ordo:0 "Unsanctioned Ordo"
  MTS_unsanctioned_ordo_desc:0 "Since we have broken off and ignored directed orders from the God-Empress herself to return to the Solar Empire, our support with our most important neighbors is nonexistent. Only a few Adoratio priestesses have sworn to serve with us, which leaves [MTS.GetLeader]'s reign an unstable one."
  MTS_corrupted_conscripts:0 "Corrupted Conscripts"
  MTS_corrupted_conscripts_desc:0 "Although we have come with an entire legion of soldiers under [MTS.GetLeader]'s command, we still rely on conscripting the masses to maintain enough presence to exert influence in our territory. The communists are unwilling servants, leaving our auxiliaries rife with insubordination."
  MTS_ill_adapted_heat_tolerance:0 "Poor Heat Adaptation"
  MTS_ill_adapted_heat_tolerance_desc:0 "The Solar Empire lands are warm, but the Empress's sun is nearly intolerable with the humidity and heat that is trapped in the jungles of the South-East. With the constant threat of malaria and other heat-borne illnesses, our troops are not an effective fighting force."
  MTS_miniscule_industry:0 "Miniscule Industry"
  MTS_miniscule_industry_desc:0 "Outside of New Horseleans, there are no other major industrial centers within [MTS.GetNameDef]. Even working around the clock, our workers struggle to keep up with the industry of other regions, even within the South-East."
  MTS_roving_repair_gangs:0 "Roving Repair Gangs"
  MTS_roving_repair_gangs_desc:0 "Indentured bodies are always the most willing to serve."
  
  ###National Focuses###
  ###Opening###
  MTS_siege_new_horseleans:0 "The Siege of New Horseleans"
  MTS_siege_new_horseleans_desc:0 "We have been repelled by the forces of [BAL.GetNameDef], short many miles from Baltimare. We cannot return to [EQS.GetNameDef] with nothing to show for our insubordination, but we cannot stay wanderers for long. The port city of New Horseleans should prove the perfect spot to establish our new capital."
  MTS_cracking_new_horseleans:0 "Cracking the City"
  MTS_cracking_new_horseleans_desc:0 "Despite [BAL.GetNameDef] abandoning all the heretics in the city, New Horseleans has proven resistant to our attack. However, there are unguarded sections that we can push through, and no matter our losses, we will take this city in the name of the Empress!"
  MTS_cauterize_rebels:0 "Cauterize Those that Resist"
  MTS_cauterize_rebels_desc:0 "Unsurprisingly, the ponies of New Horseleans have not taken well to our occupation. However, we have the deck in our favor, since we hold the weaponry. It's time to use some of the ammunition to make a point, and reduce the number of mouths that will need to be supported later."
  MTS_warning_example:0 "Warn Through Examples"
  MTS_warning_example_desc:0 "There were numerous officers and soldiers who remained in New Horseleans to coordinate the defense, but most of the defenders were untrained ponies who were pressed to fight for their homes. One of Serene Shore's priestesses, Warm Night, advocates that they be spared, but the professionals punished, as a warning for any future rebels that we will not tolerate sedition."
  MTS_permanent_temporary_base:0 "Permanent Temporary Basecamp"
  MTS_permanent_temporary_base_desc:0 "Since New Horseleans is still devastated from our capture and subsequent punishment, there are few suitable locations for our forces to establish themselves. Keeping our troops near the edge of the city will allow quick responses to either unrest or impending attacks. It'll only be temporary, anyway."
  MTS_host_first_service:0 "Host the First Services"
  MTS_host_first_service_desc:0 "Not priestesses of the Adoratio have traveled with us, since the theology of [MTS.GetNameDef] is considered "heterodox," and therefore, not actively encouraged by the fat heads in Sanctum Solar. However, the contingent under Serene Shore have proven amenable to our ideals, and are already starting to instruct the basics of an ascetic lifestyle to the citizens."
  MTS_establish_inquisitor_teams:0 "Establish Inquisitor Teams"
  MTS_establish_inquisitor_teams_desc:0 "Only a few inquisitors dared to defy Lady Inquisitor Quasar Pulse and the Empress to travel with us, but they have already proven instrumental in maintaining order within New Horseleans. Now that resistance is spreading outside the city, it is time for Archmage Pinpoint to organize hunter-seeker groups to eliminate these before they become a threat."
  MTS_crack_down_on_thestrals:0 "Crack Down on Thestrals"
  MTS_crack_down_on_thestrals_desc:0 "As a haven of all things unclean, COBSOC had allowed the greatest insult to the Empress, the thestrals, spread out and settle in different regions. Due to their backward, tribal thinking, they have proven difficult to dislodge, but now that we have an Inquisitionis presence, we can dedicate many resources to wiping them from the face of the peninsula."
  MTS_first_faithful:0 "The First Faithful"
  MTS_first_faithful_desc:0 "Thousands have flocked to the words of Serene Shore and her priestesses and to show their desire to remain in the Empress's good graces, have volunteered to serve with us in an auxiliary capacity. These are untrained and still tainted with heretical ideals, but they could prove useful fodder when we expand to the peninsula."
  MTS_reconstruction_teams:0 "Reconstruction Teams"
  MTS_reconstruction_teams_desc:0 "There are numerous prisoners that have yet to be purified of their crimes. While we wait to uphold justice, we can use them for a benefit: There is much work that must be done to repair New Horseleans, and too few free bodies to do it."
  MTS_flush_out_jungles:0 "Flush Out the Jungles"
  MTS_flush_out_jungles_desc:0 "Some of the fledgeling resistance groups have taken shelter within the thick canopies of Hayseed Swamp and its surrounding jungles, harassing our garrisons that have been established in the largest settlements and otherwise inflicting casualties that we cannot replace. Thankfully, we don't need to actually search for them when burning them out will be just as effective."
  MTS_eliminate_commissars:0 "Eliminate Old Commissars"
  MTS_eliminate_commissars_desc:0 "Although most of the forces of COBSOC fled when the government collapsed, some stayed in the city to organize defenses against any potential attacks or uprising. These commissars are few in number, but hold much influence in fighting-aged ponies, and could prove to be a problem if allowed to live for much longer, which requires that we deal with them. Now."
  MTS_necessary_sacrifices:0 "Necessary Sacrifices"
  MTS_necessary_sacrifices_desc:0 "At the moment, ponies are reluctant to give up what few luxuries they have to focus all they can on the Empress and the prize that is promised in her. They cling to their trinkets and baubles like shiny pearls that will fade in only a short time, hindering our ability to mobilize for war. We must cut them off immediately, so they can learn to survive with what is strictly needed."
  MTS_solar_pressers:0 "Solar Pressers"
  MTS_solar_pressers_desc:0 "There is still much that can be done to shore up our position within the South-East, as we require many more bodies to supplement our forces, but also further development of infrastructure to mobilize for the war effort. Sending gangs of our soldiers into the cities to recruit new ponies will not be popular, but it is something that we must do if we want to survive. They might not, though."
  MTS_labor_for_empress:0 "Labor for the Empress"
  MTS_labor_for_empress_desc:0 "Although they can be used for vain accessories, the region in which we find ourself in is filled to the brim with natural resources that can be put toward our impending war with the other breakaways. However, with limited capacity for modern refining, for now, we will require of our citizens they sacrifice their time to improve our production lines, whether they want to or not."
  MTS_first_step:0 "The First Step"
  MTS_first_step_desc:0 "Now that many are primed for the ideas of [MTS.GetNameDef], it should be only a simple speech that will lead many to realizing the joy of simple lifestyles and training for conflict from Scorched Earth. The reduced strain on our industry will be a boon for reconstruction, as well as the reclaimation that could be done with their trinkets."
  MTS_first_bridge:0 "The First Bridge"
  MTS_first_bridge_desc:0 "To entice more ponies to learn about Daybreaker and her demands, Warm Night has proposed that we establish some community shelters for those most afflicted. Although it won't directly simplify their lifestyle, those that find aid there could be asked to assist with some of the building projects that are planned for the future, with the promise of shelter once done."
  MTS_theological_debates:0 "Theological Debates"
  MTS_theological_debates_desc:0 "The differences between Scorched Earth and Warm Night have reached a boiling. Word has just reached that the priestess is going to confront the General in his quarters. We can only hope that the guards arrive in time."
