  POLITICS_1048_SCORCHED_EARTH_DESC: "§YBorn§!: August 2nd, 1009 ALB\n\nScorched Earth grew up in a world where there was no memory of harmony and love between ponies. At the tailwind of the \"Placated Generation,\" all of his earliest memories are nothing but war and suffering, as first changelings, then communists ripped across the battered Equestria and nearly caused its collapse.\n\nIn the first months of the Great War, his family fled from some of the pegasi cloud settlements near the changeling border to the relative safety of the Canterlot region. When Daybreaker ascended, Scorched Earth was little more than a young colt obsessed with the war stories of returning veterans of the "War with the Bugs." In the ensuing years, he enlisted into the rebranded Solaris Militarium and saw action on the front lines against the South-East, whenever incursions from the various communist cells crossed the thin boarder between the nations.\n\nWorking his way through the ranks, he achieved the position of major after only a few short battles, all of which were ended by decisive, planned action from troops under his command. For a time, he worked with fellow officer Solar Strike to quell some nascent heretics in the central region of the Solar Empire before returning to Ordo Maris to work with its archmage, Ion Trail, and keep the peace.\n\nWith the advent of the South-East's crumbling and his own assessment that the Solar Empire has become too bloated to effectively accomplish anything, he has taken a page from Solar Strike. Having marched his army of the 7th Glorious Flame out of the Empire, he has established a new order in a basecamp in former communist territory.\n\nTrue to his name, Scorched Earth has aggressively subdued the local population, and instituted martial law. With heretics being rounded up in the street daily, life is questionably better under nominal Imperial rule than Cobalt Hoof. However, the entire South-East is his goal, and if it cannot be won, then it can burned to the ground instead."

With the zealotry of ten Solaris Adoratio priestesses, charges are led from the front into the waiting arms of heretics wishing to embrace their doom. The Solar Empire will be restored. One death at a time."
