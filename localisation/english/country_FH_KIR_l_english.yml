  KIR_thousand_year_peace_desc:0 "The Great Silence and its aftermath was endured, and [KIR.GetNameDef] came out the other side more united than ever and a bulwark of stability in a chaotic continent and world. For the last twenty years, we have prospered and become one of the leading economic powers of Zebrica. Smaller nations have flocked to us, and peace has been our bedrock upon which we've built everything we see. Zebrica can burn around us, but [KIR.GetNameDef] will stand for a thousand years the only oasis in a sea of insanity."
