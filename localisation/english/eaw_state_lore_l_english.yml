state_lore_text_container_state_name_429:0 "The §YCity§! of §YChivalry§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_429:0 "If one wants to experience the idealistic vision of old Griffonia, with its knights and tourneys and great heroes, there is no more emblematic place of that age than Turhamn, the great City of Chivalry.\n\nNestled away in Sky Bay, Turhamn has served as the capital of the isolated §CKingdom of Vedina§! for centuries, hosting kings and legends both great and evil. The home of the §CKnights of Vedina§!, some of the most chivalrous and adept warriors in all of Griffonia, the city of Turhamn is a beacon of tradition and brilliance. Statues of the great heroes and kings of Vedina adorn every park and palace, and worshippers of the Vedinan patron saint, the §GWise Lady§!, can be seen flocking to Vedina in the thousands to pay homage to her wisdom and generosity.\n\nHowever, Turhamn, like the rest of Vedina, is emblematic of a §Rlarger problem§! - industrial centers now rise over the palaces and knightly barracks of Vedina's nobility and protectors, and the once-proud citizens of Turhamn have grown §Ycomplacent§! and §Ymaterialistic§!. Shops, taverns, and centers of debauchery have sprung up in the lowest places of Turhamn, and its once-grand nobility has forced to scheme and plot in the shadows. The people, who once worshipped their rulers as §YGod-Kings themselves§!, blessed by Boreas and the Wise Lady, now have begun to riot for the rights and freedoms expected of Vedina's harmonic system.\n\nLooks can be deceiving, and Turhamn's noble air and idealistic vision, to many, is §Ronly a facade§!."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_522:0 "Even whilst the last §YRepublican§! remnants were still being wiped out in the Herzland, and as §YKemerskai's warlords§! struggled to consolidate their exiled regime in Cloudbury, the ideals of the First Griffonian Revolution had already been long dead; its rotten principles of militarism, statism, and bourgeois liberalism had provided no providence against the resurgent Imperial counterattack.\n\nSickleclaw's §RInternationalists§! would have none of Kemerskai's degenerate revisionism, nor could they bring themselves to adopt the disunited isolationism of their §CCommunalist§! counterparts. Upon the foundations of a tribal settlement, they would set about the realisation of their egalitarian vision, made manifest in the brick and mortar of their home - the city of §GNew Skynavia§!, a bastion of progress and idealism reclaimed from the primitive wastes of the far north, named after the region which they had taken.\n\nThe houses are plain but sturdy, short yet spacious, and the asceticism of their furnishings are rendered inconsequential, within a society premised upon the tenets of usufruct. New Skynavia may not have palaces or skyscrapers, but neither are there slums or ghettoes.\n\nUp north, there is little beauty to be found - not in the frigid wastes of the vast tundra, nor within the drab neighbourhoods of New Skynavia. Here, nothing is beautiful - §Ynothing but the faces§!.\n\nWe have nothing but that, nothing, but §Yeach other§!.\n"

state_lore_text_container_state_name_short_485:0 "Cloudbury"
state_lore_text_container_state_name_485:0 "The §YRefuge§! of the §YExiles§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_485:0 "According to legend, the first ruling lord of Cloudbury, §CErik the Wise§!, founded the grand city due to the godly clouds swarming around the town, which he believed to be a §Ysign from Boreas§!. Perhaps it was, for Cloudbury prospered for centuries as the namesake and capital of the Duchy of Cloudbury. Prosperity came to its cloudy hills and plains, but when the §YGriffonian Empire§! arrived, the Duchy slowly fell into decline. Cloudbury became decrepit and §Rreliant on Imperial aid§!, and when the Empire fell, economic and social depression took its toll on the city.\n\nHowever, when §GAlexander Kemerskai§!, exiled President-Marshal of the Griffonian Republic arrived, he revitalized Cloudbury as a center of his new Republic in the North. Cloudbury was urbanized and reformed, and Republican exiles poured into the city, leading to it becoming one of the first Republican cities to reach over 50% Griffish literacy. Although smog now blots out much of the pleasant cloudy skies of Cloudbury and those speaking Cloudburian are seldom seen, it has become a bustling center of industry, and its close proximity to many rivers has allowed it to ferry trade west to the greater Republican ports.\n\nIn recent years, Cloudbury has become influenced by the §RLeft Wing§! of the National Republican Party, as intellectuals and workers alike flock to Rikard Astler's democratic socialist camp, which promises a truly free and equal Republic free from Kemerskai's meddling influence. Despite the Republic's political differences, however, the §YTricolour§! still flies over the presidential palace of Cloudbury as it has for 30 years - and under the Republican dream, it may never fall."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_short_433:0 "Rottendedam"
state_lore_text_container_state_name_433:0 "The §YGateway§! of §YGriffonia§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_433:0 "Nestled in the Griffking estuary, §GRottendedam§! has always been Feathisia's natural harbour city, locked in a fierce rivalry with Skyfall over being Griffonia's most important port. The further one sails up the Griffking towards the city-centre, the less modern the piers and cranes become, telling a story of the expanding maritime trade pushing the harbour ever-further out towards the sea. For centuries, the wealth of distant parts of the world has flown into this port, the fruits of the labour of Feathisian explorers, traders and at times, conquerors.\n\nHowever, not every Rottendedammer has profited equally from the city's success, and especially with the fading fortunes of the §YGriffonian Empire§!, the city's poor have become radicalised. Meanwhile, a significant foreign quarter of ponies live in relative luxury, causing jealousy exploited by the country's nationalist politicians. Home of the Fetisisch Nationalistisch Verbond, a party which would rather see the gate of Feathisia being shut, the city is two-faced indeed.\n\nMore notable sites of the city include the Vlootacademie, where many imperial admirals were trained, the Colonial Quarters, where administrators and military personnel are trained for duty in the Zebrides and the gigantic Vismarkt, the fish market-hall near the harbour, where thrifty Feathisians brave the penetrating smell to haggle with the merchants.\n\n"

state_lore_text_container_state_name_short_538:0 "Mirabelle"
state_lore_text_container_state_name_538:0 "The §YCity§! of §YCanals§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_538:0 "§YMirabelle§!, a region named for her plums, is an area in northern Feathisia on both banks of the Griffking and bordering both the historical duchies of Cloudbury and Strawberry. Most beings associate the name more with the city, but those outside the city, especially in Grieslein claim that the city of Mirabelle is named after the region and not the other way around.\n\nMirabelle city is the §Gindustrial titan§! of Feathisia, a city whose population exploded due to the industrial revolution. The historical centre is based on rings of canals, lined by the houses of rich merchants, build in the Feathisian style with stair-step gables. The canals house fairs and markets in winter, when the water freezes over. In older times, the top floor was used for storing merchandise, but nowadays those are stored near the factories. In the city centre one finds a marvellous late-imperial style train station and the §YGrand-Ducal museum§!, housing artefacts from the Zebrides and works by Feathisian painters.\n\nThe neatly kept squares, monuments and canals, which are home to the higher and middle class, are encased by the square and planned §Rindustrial neighbourhoods§! that emerged with the advent of the steam-age. A sea of small brick houses for workers build against each other houses most of the Mirabelleans and in these neighbourhoods of the working class the §RPartij van de Arbeid§! finds her supporters. It is not uncommon for workers here to get a union card as a gift from their parents when they become an adult and many prominent PvdA politicians have their roots in Mirabelle, including the radical §RRozenkamp brothers.§!\n\nOutside of the city, Feathisian farmers farm the famous Mirabel plums and the other food for the city, not much concerned with the goings-on of the city. Further downstream on the Griffking is the provincial city of §HGrieslein§!, which never grew to such proportions as Mirabelle, but has been the historical capital of the region. For those who cannot stand the air in Mirabelle, Grieslein offers a welcome reprieve. Proper and unremarkable in every way, it is a typical small Feathisian city, where most of the griffons support either the §GFetisisch Hertogelijke Partij§! or the §CLiberaal Democratische Partij. §!"

state_lore_text_container_state_name_short_520:0 "De Vleugels"
state_lore_text_container_state_name_520:0 "The §YHofstad§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_520:0 "§YDe Vleugels§! is the ancient seat of the §HWeijermars family§!, once no more than a castle defending one of the crossing over the Griffking river. Over time, through prudent expansion, the Weijermars family became the ruling family of Feathisia, making De Vleugels §Gthe capital§!. The town would grow into the largest city of Feathisia, rising with her lords and profiting from being the seat of government and from increased trade over the Griffking in the imperial days. To the west of the city are the ducal woods, property of the Weijermars family and used for hunting and recreation by the nobility.\n\nThe ancient castle is now gone, replaced by a more modern manor as the residence for the Grand Duke. Around it, straddled on the west bank of the Griffking, through small and winding streets, the city stretches out. In the centre, close to the manor, are the many offices and buildings required to run a modern state. Ministries, administration, the tax service, the High Court.\n\nMost importantly, however, is the §YVolkshof§!, the Feathisian parliament. The series of buildings are built around a small court and house the representatives of the Feathisian people. Originally, the Volkshof was there to house the General Estates, representatives from merchants, nobles and the prelates. As Feathisia reformed into a democracy, however, the old buildings were renovated to become the symbol of the new power of the people. However, even this hof, or court, is not the reason why De Vleugels is called §Ythe Hofstad.§! At the time when the city grew in power and size, the Southern-Griffonian styles were in fashion, as the Empire had recently subdued that part of Griffonia. Thus, many houses or groups of houses were built around smaller or larger courts or inner gardens, while still retaining the Feathisian brick houses, making the city a unique blend of southern ideas with northern materials."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_short_486:0 "Readewetter"
state_lore_text_container_state_name_486:0 "Land of §YStrawberries§! and §YWine§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_486:0 "§CStrawberry Duchy§! is a land known across the Empire for it's exotic strawberry wines, but within it's own borders, there is no wine more prestigious than §YReadewetter Royal Red§!. Travelers come from far and wide to sample the finest vintages, and indeed it is a sign of wealth among the commoners for the family to have their own unopened bottle on display in the common room. But while travelers may be drawn to §CReadewetter§! for drink, they often find much more waiting for them within its walls. \n\nFor while much of the Empire was left scarred by the fires of the §RGriffonian Revolution§!, Readewetter emerged largely unscathed. The fighting was done in distant provinces, and the veterans of the old conflict returned home to cheers of adoration. As the curious visitor enters the city through the §YKnight's Arch§!, statues of valiant Strawberry griffons adorned in gleaming armor look down on them, the alternating flags of the §YEmpire§! and the §CDuchy§! fluttering in the wind above. \n\nFrom there the inquisitive traveler is free to explore one of the cultural peaks of the §YEmpire§!. What the city lacks in modern industry, it more than makes up for it with merry charm. Musicians line the streets, singing out the latest gossip or news while hobbyist vintners exchange their latest vintages in open-air cafes. In the §YStrawberry Quarter§!, vibrantly dressed merchants argue with equally colorful salesgriffs as to the exact value of each barrel of wine, their tasting spoons gleaming in the sun like dueling daggers. Extravagant homes compete for attention in the §YNoble's Quarter§!, where each noble family proudly displays their colors and crest on intricate tapestries. And most magnificent of all, the §YDuchess's Estate§! watches from the banks of the §YBrantbeak River§!, it's hedge maze open to all comers who might seek the delectable strawberry bushes hidden inside. \n\nYes, §CStrawberry§! is a land of wine, but in §CReadewetter§! the traveler learns that it is so much more."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_492:0 "§YBronzekreuz§! once was a small mountain village at the slopes of the Bronzehügel, where the §YEmpire§! mined copper and iron. In 792 ALB, the great Emperor §YGrover II§! gave the village and all of the surrounding lands to a band of escaped slaves from Diamond Mountain, as long as they swore him fealty. This was the birth of the §CCounty of Bronzehill§!, named after the mountain of its capital. The diligent diamond dogs started to drill into the mountain, to create a cave city like in their homeland.\n\nOver time, Bronzekreuz has grown massively. The dogs of Bronzekreuz speak mostly Griffish, and have taken on a variety of Herzlander customs and traditions. Yet, the beauty of the city still lies in its §Gunique blend§! of §YDogish§! and §YHerzlander§! style and architecture. Most notably, parts of the city are underground like a cave city usual in Diamond Mountain, while other parts sprawl across the slopes of the Bronzehügel.\n\nNotable sites in the city include the §0Bronzekreuz Castle§!, seat of the count and a marvel of architectural blend with parts both above and below the ground, then the opera house, the so-called §0Wiesentreff§!, and finally the §0Freiheitsbrücke§! across the §YBellen§!, the river that parts the city. However, especially in recent times, the city also has seen massive investments into its industry, mostly by §Rbusinessgriffons§! from other parts of Herzland. While this has improved the city's economy and attracted many more dogs, it also led to the §Rrise of social tensions§!..."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_424:0 "The §YCity§! on the §YRavenlake§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_424:0 "Legend tells that in 357 ALB, the local count by the name of Raven Blackbeak was shown a §Ysign by Boreas§!: A lightning strike struck the same tree thrice right in front of him. The local priest told Raven that this was a demand of the god to show piety and devotion, and so Count Blackbeak constructed a §Yshrine§! in honour of the highest of the gods. Over time, the shrine became a temple and the city of §YRavensburg§! grew around it. Reality is likely much more mundane, as more secular historical records show that Ravensburg developed out of a §Yfishing village§! and §Ytrading hub§!, profiting from the location where the §YRaven river§! flows into the Ravenlake.\n\nRegardless of its origin, §YRavensburg§! is a prospering city. Inhabited by dogs and griffons to roughly equal parts, the city features various sights. The most notable is of course the §0Tempel of Boreas§!, seat of the prelate of Bronzehill. Others include the §0Kaiserplatz§! with a grand statue of Grover II and the §0Fischermeile§!, a market filled by the local fishers to sell their products.\n\nIn the last years, a large construction project has taken place near the city, the §YGrover V Industrial Park§!. The new project, largely invested in by businessgriffs from various parts of Herzland, promises to bring many new opportunities to the city. To power the park, a dam was constructed across the Raven to harvesting the hydroelectric energy."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_short_423:0 "Katerinburg"
state_lore_text_container_state_name_423:0 "The §YWorst§! Place in §YGriffonia§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_423:0 "Many places have known better days, yet it is arguable if §YKaterinburg§! has ever known worse days. Once the city was the site of the old §YKaternii Kingdom§!, whose power was famed throughout Herzland and beyond. Under the §YGrimclaw§! dynasty of kings, the Katernii's power reached even into the Riverlands for some time, and great wealth flowed to the capitol from its rhinestone industries and its position to tax all trade flowing down the Griffking. In addition, its distinct warrior traditions and its law codes made it a notable power in the region, one that could well have been a threat to the rising §YGriffonian Empire§!.\n\nAlas, the Katernii fell not on the battlefield, but due to treason. A local noble family swore allegiance to the new, rising power of the Herzland in secrecy. With their help, the Katernii army was subverted and outmanouvered, ensuring that the old kingdom died not with a bang, but a whimper. For their service, this family was given the lands of Katerin, taking the name §Yvon Katerinburg§! after the city. As a part of the §YGriffonian Empire§!, however, the entire region became looked upon as a backwater. Its warrior culture slowly withered, its industries were outclassed by Griffenheim's and in the end, all that was left was an impoverished region and a city struggling to get by.\n\nIt was only when the §YRevolution of 978§! struck, however, that Katerin's fate truly was sealed. A combination of high taxes, harsh landlords and mismanagement by the von Katerinburgs led to a brutal peasant uprising that saw large parts of the city devastated and most of the von Katerinburg family lynched. In the wake, with the ascension of §YDiellza von Katerinburg§! to the throne, things turned yet again for the worse. After a few years and in a fit of paranoia, Diellza ordered the entire city relocated from its historical site deeper into the swamps. This move has all but bankrupted the already struggling nation, and Katerinburg has ever since been slowly put back together again in lands that seem like it want to swallow it whole. Many of the charms of the old city has been long gone, and Katerinburg struggles merely to survive in its current situation and location."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_short_411:0 "The Scheißwald"
state_lore_text_container_state_name_411:0 "The §YForest of Mud and Darkness§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_411:0 "Few places in all of Griffonia has been as stubborn in its resistance to being tamed as the dark, foreboding forest known as The §YScheißwald§!. Though situated right in the backyard of the Griffonian Empire, it has never quite let go of the region despite centuries of efforts from the Griffons. Instead it has lingered, offering sanctuary for outlaws, madgriffs and countless monsters, many of who are still not fully documented by Griffonian zoologists.\n\nIts name speaks volumes of its place in the Griffonian consciousness. Whereas the §YEverfree Forest§! in Equus has earned fear and a modicum of respect from the ponies living close to it, the Scheißwald is cursed as a place of death and danger, with mud so thick and fetid that it has been described as wading through excrement up to your hips. The stench blowing from it during spring and autumn from this mud can travel for dozens of miles on the winds. In fact, an apocrypical tale claims that §YGriffenheim§! was founded where Grover I could "no longer neither smell the fetid mud nor hear the vicious roars emanating from those accursed woods."\n\nDespite its vicious reputation, the §YScheißwald§! is viewed by some as not a cursed hellscape, but a wonder without equal. It holds many species of monsters not seen anywhere else in the world, and though the inaccessibility and hostility of the deeper parts of the woods has made exploring an excruciating process, botanists have found examples of nearly every medicinal herb documented in Griffonian history as well.\n\nThis has done little to help the local griffons, who despite centuries of struggle continue to try to tame the region with varying degrees of success. In the §YPrincipality of Katerin§! and the §YBarony of Angriver§!, the local griffons have not only established themselves around it, but indeed within it as well in certain cases, and though the Scheißwald stubbornly refuses to yield to anygriff, the griffons who have settled in the region are not wont to give up so easily either."

The Greenback Academy of Medicine has done wonders for every griffon in Yale and Griffonia as a whole, with new ways of saving the lives of thousands of griffons pioneered every day. Magical potential has also been studied in Greenback more than any other Griffonian city, with biology departments studying day and night on what truly makes a griffon magical.\n\nClosest to the Greenback University stands the §CGreenback Hospital§!, where the university's unique doctrine of Pharmacology encourages students to seek the effects of their own drugs and medicine on the local population, to truly ensure innocent griffons are not being harmed. Thousands of staffers keep the healthcare system in Yale one of the greatest in all Griffonia, and through trial and error, medical science has prospered.\n\nHowever, §Rnot all is well§! in Greenback. A centre of industry and pollution, the city is experiencing the full impact of industrialism. Behind the old half-timbered houses on the Kaiserplatz rise plumes of smoke from her factories and the Angriver which flows through the city has been too polluted to drink from. However, many marvels have also been created from this new age, most beloved of which is the gigantic Station One, the starting point of the Imperial Railway. A massive building, who's waiting halls carry frescos depicting all corners of the Griffonian Empire at its height.\n\nTo the west of the capital lies Greengate, home of the great university of engineering, a smaller city where the divides of class are a loss less easily felt.

As his realm spread far across the continent Arantigos founded city after city to serve as the fortresses and centers of his new empire. Romau, while not the first of these, was perhaps the greatest. Founded on the intersection of great rivers it quickly prospered after the fall of the Kingdom of Sparléos under the rule of an alternating series of Dictators and rule by its enshrined §GSenate§!. The §GGrand Temple of Eyr§! was constructed during this golden age, becoming the home of the holy §YArchon of Eyr§!.\n\nWhile there was a point under the rule of Kaeso Tatian that Romau seemed on the cusp of having an empire of its own, it was not to be. Soon Romau fell subject to the great §YEmperor Grover I§! who took the city for his own Empire, using it as a base while he carved out what would become the §YHerzland§! of 1007. Following this in 728, the great §YRomau University§! was founded and was a major center of education in the Empire for many years.\n\nThe city suffered ups and downs, even being decimated and having any land outside the city itself taken by Grover II after a rebellion in 785, but in the end, the Imperial claw served Romau well.

state_lore_text_container_state_name_381:0 "The §YBiggest§! Little §YCity§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_381:0 "Who in Griffonia - and even beyond - hasn't heard of Skyfall? While it may not be a political center as powerful as say Griffenheim, Canterlot or Rijekograd, it is the most prosperous and industrious city on the continent. Many exquisite goods come out of the city, be them diamonds, cars or fashionable Griffonian clothes, and while Equestria still maintains the lead on modern manufacturing globally, Skyfall is home of the most technically advanced factories and craftgriffs in all of Griffonia. The currently most famous one is the Kessler automobile plant which produces some of the most widely used cars in Griffonia.\n\nSkyfall is known as a city but it is actually a metropolitan community of nineteen smaller towns, each ruled by a mayor and their own local councils. This is merely a near-folkloric archaism as these "towns" have no recognizable borders and some streets can belong to several towns. Even distinguishing them between on the basis of wealth, activities or style is impossible as Skyfall is so chaotically organized that one may leave a street of insalubrious houses only to find mansions just around the corner. Lack of uniformity and charming chaos are indeed the defining features of the city, making it a divisive place to visit. To some, it is an endless wonder to stroll in while an ignominious mess to the more orderly-minded.\n\nSkyfall is home to many landmarks, both old and new. At its historical center sits the Grote Markt, the historical market of the city which was home to the most prestigious guild halls of the city decorated with golden gables, balustrades and statues. Not far of the Grote Markt stands the Skyfall Stock Exchange built in the style of a religious temple and which is the busiest stock exchange in the continent. North of the city, you can find the great Groverian Park, Skyfall's largest park area where the three great temples dedicated to Eyr, Arcturius and Boreas have been built. The great harbour is also known for some of its old market places and warehouses as well as hosting the former Imperial Navy which has been seized and nationalized during Guichard's secession. A hill on the southern part of the city is home to a gigantic palace of justice designed by Joseph Poulaert, a Fezeran-born architect who had sought to create a monument showcasing the might of the law and the Griffonian judiciary. Originally planned under Grover IV's reign, it was finished by Ghislain Guichard's government as a tribute to the Trade Federation dedication to the rule of law though not without the help of some corner-cutting.\n\nSkyfall's population is one of the most diverse on the continent if not the world. Virtually every sentient species is represented in some way despite Griffons forming a plurality of the population. Skyfallians are known to be educated, festive and gregarious if perhaps a bit unsophisticated and plagued with a bizarre accent. They are also known to both rageously enjoy criticizing their city and fiercely call out any foreigners who would dare try to do it themselves. The typical Skyfallian is fatter than the average and usually enjoys more than a little beer or strong liquors as well fried food. It is also known that Skyfallian are very prone to organize themselves in groups and the city is teeming with corporations, old guilds, more recent labour movements, cooperatives and organized crime. Like Fezera and Rottendedam, the city is indeed home to some of the "penose", these coastal mobs who smuggle and run various businesses."

But who has heard of Griffton? The city has always been in the shadow of its old rivals, despite its great size and prosperity.\n\nWhat can be said of the city? It is a typical western Griffonian metropolis. It has grand architecture, bustling ports, busy markets, infamous criminal gangs... there isn't much which makes the city stand out from its neighbours. This curse of mediocrity has always haunted it.\n\nFounded by §YFeathisian merchants§! many centuries before the rise of the §OGriffonian Empire§!, its inhabitants quickly took advantage of the settlement's excellent natural harbour to conduct overseas trade with Equestria, which is exactly what Skyfall's traders did as well. The competition between the two was fierce. There were short periods when Griffton secured lucrative trade deals and dominated the market, but Skyfall always found a way to recover. Eventually, the city could simply not keep up. By the time §YEmperor Grover I§! arrived on the shores of the west, Griffton was going bankrupt.\n\nGriffton was made into a §YImperial Free City§!, and the new privileges saved it from certain economic doom. Yet it was clear that competition with Skyfall was doomed to fail, so the city's merchants began to establish closer ties with their sister city instead. This helped bring prosperity to Griffton, but Skyfall's influence increased at an alarming rate. More and more companies and manufactories were bought out by Skyfallian merchants as the years went by. Even §YRadio Griffton§!, the first broadcasting company on all of Griffonia, was soon in foreign ownership. In the eve of the §RRepublican Revolution§!, it was clear to everyone that Griffton had become Skyfall's puppet.\n\nIn the chaos that followed, it was therefore inevitable that Griffton would join the newly formed §YSkyfall Trade Federation§!. Its privileges were revoked, and under the rule of the §LIron Chancellor§!, its autonomy was largely erased. The current mayor of the city does whatever the Skyfallian officials tell her to do, as long as they pay her enough bribes. It is therefore no surprise that modern Griffton is nothing more than an extension of Skyfall itself."

The western borough of the city has a notorious slum, a small sea of wooden shacks infested with rats, while the city proper has gorgeous architecture, masterfully mixing Aquileian and Herzlander styles.

Indeed, the capital of §CAquileia§! is one of the shining beacons of the arts and science in Griffonia and while many cities rest upon the past, Aquila remains forward looking. The beginning of the eleventh century saw the city undergo one of the greatest urbanistic experiments in the history of the continent. As this text is being written, workers are tearing down the old squalid neighborhoods and preparing to build a city design with modernity and reason in mind.\n\nShould one decide to take a walk in the city, they will find many great landmarks and a preview of the city to come: grand avenues decorated to please the eye of the strollers, an innovative subway, modern and delightful rows of apartment buildings, private palaces and hotels and luxurious shops. They will be able to find the great Trinity Hill - finally free of squalor - on top of which lies the three great white temples dedicated to Eyr, Boreas and Arcturius. It is there that the kings of Aquileia have traditionally been crowned as shown by the royal banners and tapestries of the ruling king. The Promenade des Ducs is also a major attraction on the banks of the great Belle river. This fancy avenue is home to many museums, libraries, theaters and private salons where the literate, wealthy or artistic elites meet and mingle. On the western edge of the cities lies the Vieux Fort, an old citadel whose black walls barely survived the sacking of the city by §RGrover II§!, and is now home to the university of the city. In the eastern part of the cities, they will find the Domaine Royal with its great parks and palaces home to the Discret dynasty and the royal government. For those with a taste for the stranger things, many parts of the city hosts a peculiar undercity called the Catacombs which acted for centuries as the city's boneyard. It is said that in the ancient times, it was a holy site dedicated to the banished god Maar.\n\nThe story of Aquila is a unique one for it is one of the few great Griffonian cities that did not owe anything to the old Kingdom of Sparléos. Instead, it was the bastion of freedom for many confederated tribes that would form the realm of Aquileia a century before our era. After becoming the capital of the kingdom, the city became a thriving trading and crafting center, one of the economic hearts of the kingdom. This long era of prosperity saw its decline in the eighth century when Aquileia was subjugated by the §YGriffonian Empire§! and finally ended in 785 when the kingdom and much of its capital was burned down by Grover II's armies. To add insult to injury, the princess Giselda Discret was forced to marry the angry emperor in the ruined temple of Arcturius on Trinity Hill. This saddest of weddings is still commemorated today and princess Giselda hailed as a martyr of the city. After this, the city slowly recovered but it is only after independence in 972 that the city finally saw a return to greatness. Much investment was made into the city by the Republicans between 980 and 985 and finally during the Discret restoration which saw the beginning of the great transformation of the city."

Many merchants were boasting wealth that could easily compete with nobility, and they made sure to show it. Their houses and villas were often opulent and decorated by famous artists.\n\nHowever, for all the splendour many were not lucky to live this lifestyle.

Many houses were rebuilt as well though they never reached the level of opulence from before the Revolution.

The first griffons were given shape by Eyr, giving them their body; wings to reach towards the heavens and beaks to praise the divine. Arcturius gave the griffons their strength; the strength to overcome all evils they might encounter, the strength to build mighty structures and tools and to overcome personal hardships. Boreas gave them intelligence, an understanding of themselves and of truth and rationality. An understanding of law and government, so that the structure of below might reflect the structure of the heavens. Lastly, Maar gave the griffons souls. With a soul they could make their own decisions and feel and decide on what was right and wrong.\n\nHaving been granted these boons, the first griffons flew out from the Solarspike to found Griffonstone, before spreading all over the continent. Much of the early history of Griffonia is shrouded in myth, but records of places of worship around the Solarspike go back to the very earliest days of known history.\n\nTo this day, there exists a small place of worship at the foot of the mountain, where pilgrims can bring offerings. From there, to show your humility towards the gods, you can walk up the stairway leading up the mountain, foregoing the use of wings. Those wishing to climb to the summit will be met with disappointment, however, as the trail ends halfway to the top of the holy mountain. There, a small shrine marks the edge of the mundane world. It contains small stone figures of the Trinity, with a broken statuette laying down in shame outside the shrine. At the zenith of where a mortal is allowed to wander, in the quiet solace of the thin mountain air, the pilgrim can rest and contemplate on the journey. To go any higher would be to tread into the realm of the divine and blasphemy. All must eventually turn back and accept that for all their hard work, divinity is outside their reach."

To the §YGriffonian Empire§! in the West, Hellquill is the valiant bulwark of the griffons, home to those knights who have sworn themselves to protect their brethren against the pony threats. To those in the §GRiverlands§!, be them Diamond Dogs or Ponies, Hellquill is a city of butchers and raiders sitting on stolen grounds and built with stolen wealth.\n\nIts story began with the great eastwards expansion of Grover II. The great emperor conquered what came to be known as the Griffonian Frontier and tasked the §YOrder of Brothers of the Griffon House of Prelate Aloysious in Cloudbury§! with guarding it. When the emperor died against a simple Nimbusian soldier and his successor cared little for his father's crusade, the knights of Hellquill settled down and began to build a series of military cities, towns and villages surrounding impressive castles and fortresses, Hellquill being the mightiest of them all.\n\nThe greatest landmark of the city is the Order's castle which stands on a hill overlooking the city and dominates the banks of the Griffking River. East of the castle stands the river port to which trade flows and where the Order surveils any trader attempting the journey between the Empire and the Riverlands. West of the castle is the pony ghetto. The walled neighbourhood is known for its poverty and squalor, caused by decades of discrimination and lack of investment from the Order. The city of Hellquill in itself stands north of the riverside districts. Its streets are one of the finest display of early groverian architecture and has seemed to maintain an atmosphere of tradition despite the march of industry. The only concession to modernity is the asphalt on the major streets, allowing for easy movement of troops and military vehicles and allowing easy access to the three great temples dedicated to Boreas, Eyr and Arcturius as well as Hellquill's Imperial Railway station which remains to this day an unfinished mess, unconnected to the Empire. The city is governed in a strange fashion with the knights delegating municipal powers to the guilds of crafters and merchants and the local prelates."

In 511 ALB, Prince Garle of Sydia sent his general, Drogus, to secure the northern frontier against §RZaphzan raiders§! by fortifying the riverbank. However, in 539 an ambitious warrior named Gobdan overthrew Drogus and declared himself §YPrince of Kivessin§!. Thus, the third principality of Prywhen was born.\n\nThanks to its location in the middle of the §YEvi Valley§!, in the confluence of rivers, Kivessin quickly grew into a city. It was sacked several times by Zaphzan griffons, but after §YEmperor Grover I's§! conquests in 705 peace and order were maintained on the frontier. When §YPrince Kloseu of Brodfeld§! declared himself king in 973, he made Kivessin his capital due to its location, prestige and history.\n\nThe most notable sight in the city is the §YKing's Palace§!, which formerly was the home of the Kivessinian princes. It is built on the foundation of the fortress which Drogus founded centuries ago, and is the largest brick building in Griffonia. Other places of interest are the §YGrand Temple of Eviliana§!, the primary center of worship for the eastern river-goddess, the old §YMarket Square§! with its medieval architecture, and the Chapterhouses of the local knightly orders.\n\nBefore the §RPrywhen Civil War§!, the outskirts of the city had been demolished and rebuilt anew, with modern apartment buildings and factories rising high above the low buildings of the historic center. This clash between old and new is still one of the most striking features of the city, even though the communists now threaten it.\n\nThere is widespread concern that many historical landmarks will be torn down if the PLA manages to secure the city due to their association with monarchy, religion and the mercantile class. During the civil war, the city has been extensively fortified, with barricades on the streets, and its once thriving market square is now empty. With the recent PLA offensives most of the inhabitants have fled, turning Kivessin into a ghost town. The fate of the city depends entirely on the outcome of the ongoing civil war."

Tonnes of grain, rice, timber, honey and other products from all of Evi Valley are brought here and exported to distant lands.

The Prince of Brodfeld then inherited the vacant throne.\n\nWhile the population of Prywhen is largely homogenous, Sydia is an exception. Here one may find Gryphussians, Wingbardians, Cyanolisians, Sicameonese and even members of other races such as Asterionese minotaurs, Macawian harpies and Colthaginian zebras.

Nevertheless, the impact of the cossacks on the city itself is clear, drawing many young griffons from the city off to fight against the ponies on the grand frontier, and many of the artisans of the city to focus their craft on supplying the steppe warriors. Kaiv is also the city in which the §YRada§! is held, an assembly in which the next Hetman is chosen.\n\nWhen looking past the rich history of the city, however, you will find nothing but a city out of time.

It is a place of surprising modernity and immense poverty. It is a place where the nobility live in halls of great opulence, while thousands of their thrall servants live in abject poverty. \n\nRecords of a settlement at Hornavík's location range as far back as 180 ALB, but the city would only truly start to grow when the so-called golden age of Austurland began. Shortly after the countries establishment, Viking raids brought a great deal of wealth back to the city and solidified its status as the economic heart of Austurland. With the end of the golden age development slowed down somewhat, but despite this, the city kept expanding.\n\nThe city itself is divided into three districts, which roughly correspond with the steps of the Austurlandic social ladder. The outskirts house the commondeer, who still choke under the yoke of feudalism and perform much of the menial labor within the city. Traveling further one would reach the harbor district, which serves as the economic heart of Hornavík. Traditional Austurlandic architecture gives way to styles inspired by Griffenheim and Rijekograd, and merchant ships docking to unload their wares are a common occurrence. This is the home of the freedeer, who lack any obligations to feudal lords except the Jarl, and make up Austurland's small but growing middle class. \n\nThe harbor itself is said to be the site where deer first landed on Griffonia, and an occasional Viking longship still returns full of plunder and thralls, though these are mostly the last vestiges of a dying profession. The days of the Vikings are over, and only the nobility's desire for more thralls keeps the profession alive. \n\nThe harbor district also contains the few signs of industrialization within Austurland. Manufactories have slowly but surely started to replace artisanal craftsmanship, though the noble owners of the land in the city are notoriously reluctant to allow any new development. A notable landmark within the district is Sturla's temple, the largest temple in the country, which serves as the main center of worship for the cities inhabitants and is the tallest structure in the country. The temple itself is opulently decorated and was personally funded by Herjólfur Sturla, a noble who briefly came to dominate Austurland's political sphere around 700 ALB, before his death would usher in a brief but intense conflict between rival noble families.\n\nThe third and final section of the city is the noble district, which is, as the name implies, mostly composed of noble estates, along with the great hall of the Jarl. Imposing walls that date back to the founding of the city separate the noble district from the rest of the city and Huskarls stand ready to eject any unwanted visitors.

However, in 905, §Ran invasion§! by Austurland razed and looted the city, leaving it as a broken husk with its ancient buildings left as nothing but rubble.\n\nModern day Seguro is an odd combination of old and modern ways born from its past; while the ancient walls still ceremonially mark the inner and outer city, in reality the city has far extended outwards from its original confinements. As the administrative and judicial capital, it houses the §YCouncil Hall§!, where the §CAdvisory Council§!, the highest governing body in Kása, gathers for meetings. This building also acts as the official residence of the §CFirst Commander§!. The old central plaza, where once the pirates had sold their loot and slaves, is now dominated by a large statue dedicated to Sinóra Pon and her band, who'd not only united Kása but defended Seguro to their death against the Austurland invasion. Nearby to this park rises many estates held by the rich, build in the 910s during the reconstruction of the capital with aid of a Macawian architect; these buildings combine elements of the old Wittenlandic buildings with the more luxurious style from Macawia. Amongst these luxurious boulevards also lay many §Gfinancial institutions§! and §Gtrade corporations§! specialized in shipping products between §YZebrica§! and §YGriffonia.§!\n\nPast them lay the §Ygreat harbour§!, where each day many ships dock to or depart from to brave the seas. Recent §Gmodernization efforts§! have led to the old harbour adopting steam cranes and railways to move the cargo. Nearby rise many apartment complexes, where many labourers dwell who work within the city in various menial tasks. New manufacturing complexes can also be found by the coast, mainly owned by Macawian corporations or few enterprising Kásans. However, with each passing day these factories are expanding, as the state continues to pour money into industrialisation schemes.\n\nHowever, there is a §Rgrim§! side to the otherwise shining city. In its further outskirts, over the old war-border, a sprawling maze of §Yshobby buildings§! and §Yslums§! spreads out into the inland. Those living there had arrived to the capital seeking for work and better life but have ended up trapped in the dangerous, filthy living space. For many years there has been lobbying and consistent efforts to alleviate the situation but so far these actions have not amounted to much, leading to some civil strife in the local politics."

It was in the mountains surrounding the hidden city that the religion known as §CThe Way of Fire§! is said to have had its genesis, where the monks and mystics came down from the mountains to share everything they learned from communing with the divine fire being, §GConcord§!, with the local population. In time, as The Way of Fire spread throughout the §YRealm of Kiria§!, the city only grew in importance and size. Due to its spiritual and political importance as the birthplace of the Way of Fire and the seat of the Vermilion Dynasty, Vermilion became the largest city in the realm, complete with a sprawling palace complex, a bureaucratic and diplomatic quarter, and magnificent gardens, though this was not to last.\n\nAs Kiria entered a period of tumultuous change brought about by the advent of industrialization and capitalism, the teachings of The Way of Fire could no longer calm the excesses of a populace drunk on the heady prospects of modernisation. In 902, a merchants' protest against a decree by §YMatriarch Superior Noctilucent Charm§! restricting the establishment of monoculture tea plantations in the Vermilion Basin was confronted by a mob of commoners, enraged that the merchants would question the wisdom and authority of their Matriarch. Nokirin is sure who changed first, but in the midst of the brawling, somekirin turned into a §Rnirik§!, and the chaos spread like wildfire. By the end of the day, four-fifths of Vermilion had been burnt to the ground, with the last flames finally extinguished only a week later. The inferno claimed hundreds of lives, injured tens of thousands, and most of Vermilion's population was left homeless. It was the scars left upon Noctilucent Charm's psyche by this tragedy that would directly lead to her series of radical decrees and proclamations that established §RThe Silence§!.\n\nVermilion was slowly rebuilt over the following century, and still serves as the seat of the Vermilion Dynasty, though The Silence has robbed it of all its authority. Yet here, more than anywhere else in the realm, The Way of Fire is still strong, and the Matriarch's authority still holds absolute sway over the kirin that live here. Following the determined efforts of an Equestrian diplomatic mission to make contact with §YMatriarch Superior Rain Shine§! in 1006 ALB, The Silence was lifted locally around the city. Now, Vermilion is growing at a rate it hasn't seen in a century, and one day, it may reclaim its status as the crown jewel of the kirin realm.\n"

Fragrance once handled the bulk of the realm's trade between the deer of the north and the parrots of §YMacawia§!, with some traders reaching as far as §YSouthern Griffonia§! during the city's most prosperous years. As such, it was always the first to receive new ideas and put them into action, helping to further culturally separate the city from the rest of the kirin heartlands, as species from all across the globe settled into the city to open businesses and ply their trade. It was also in the city of Fragrance that the §Ymodernization of Kiria§! began, with the advent of capitalism and the establishment of an ever-growing kirin bourgeoisie only further radicalizing the changes happening within the city. There was some pushback from local leaders who feared that modernization of the country would come between the common kirin and the divine authority of their §YMatriarch§!, but these voices were unable to stop the changes happening to the city. Within years, Fragrance had grown into the richest city in Kiria, and it seemed like it would only grow richer with time.\n\n§RThe Silence§! put a swift and brutal end to that. When the decrees from the capital outlawed money, property, and hierarchical organization, the economy of Fragrance collapsed overnight. The trade routes the city needed to thrive simply disappeared, and the workers that toiled in the factories returned to the countryside to farm. Though bourgeoisie and merchants from throughout the realm fled to Fragrance in a hope to salvage their businesses and way of life, the damage had already been done. Fragrance, a city built around trade and business, suddenly lost its purpose.\n\nIn time, Fragrance would turn to less morally responsible activities to sustain itself and its populace. §RPirates§!, §Rsmugglers§!, and §Ymercenaries§! sought to keep the city alive and its citizens fed by finding some way of bringing money into the city. The kirin navy, mothballed in the city's massive harbor, mutineed, with many sailors turning to piracy to provide for themselves and their families.

When she rested at the site for the night, she fell in love with its beauty and splendor, and felt that this land had, more than almost anywhere else in Kiria, been blessed by Concord herself. Before she departed to continue her ascent to the mountaintops, the Priestess decreed the spot where she rested a suitably auspicious site to build a city dedicated to the reverence of Concord, and began to directly organize the settlement of the region when she returned to Vermilion. A small cadre of Vermilion Priests led ten thousand followers over the mountains and hills between the capital and the decreed spot, choosing the name of §CRhapsody§! upon breaking ground for the first building, in celebration of the many hymns praising Concord the expedition sang on their journey. In time, Rhapsody would grow to become an impressive metropolis devoted to the study and worship of Concord's teachings, growing to rival both §YVermilion§! and §YFragrance§! in spite of — or perhaps, owing to — its relative isolation from either.\n\nIt was this isolation that has allowed Rhapsody to flourish despite the imposition of §RThe Silence§!. In 779 ALB, a rebellious sectlet of Vermilion Priests relocated to the city after expressing their dissatisfaction with the reigning Matriarch's policies and supposedly hedonistic lifestyle. Over the following decades, this branch of the theocracy worked to distance Rhapsody from what they saw as the crumbling divine authority of the Vermilion Dynasty in Vermilion, though they never went so far as to outright say so. The kirin of Rhapsody soon came to believe that they knew the Way of Fire better than the scholars and mystics in the capital, and as such, they had a truer interpretation of Concord's teachings than even the Matriarch. Though this caused §Ofriction§! between Vermilion and Rhapsody, nothing came of it until §RThe Silence§! was decreed in 902 ALB. While the rest of the nation slowly began to crumble, decay, and decentralize as a result of §YMatriarch Superior Noctilucent Charm's§! decrees, Rhapsody resisted them, believing that the Matriarch had wrongly interpreted Concord's divine solution to the nirik problem. While cities across the realm slowly depopulated as The Silence strengthened, many fled to Rhapsody, which continued to grow in size and influence. The city carefully wielded its religious fervor to halt the changes and modernization that had caused so much chaos in the rest of the realm without resorting to implementing the Matriarch's policies, and so survived the intervening century relatively unscathed.\n\nNowadays, §CRhapsody§! boasts the largest population in all of the realm, and the city is larger and more prosperous than any other kirin city in the world. The kirin of Rhapsody are fiercely independent and envision themselves as a cut above the rest of their kind, empowered and enlightened by their interpretations of Concord's teachings. But with the Silence ending throughout the realm, only time will tell if Rhapsody can hang onto its status as the leading center of enlightenment in the nation, or if it will fall behind the imperial capital once more.\n"

Where the Great Mellifluve's three branches meet, a massive stretch of floodplains and small islands have arisen, creating fertile and plentiful ground for an expanding and powerful city. Verdant is that city, once strong and grand on a level to rival even the city of §YRhapsody§! far to the east, and even wrestling with the city of §YFragrance§! as the realm's most important trading city. Verdant controls all the trade flowing out of the realm's heartlands and into the South Kirin Sea, and once enjoyed close trade ties with the city of §YBlossom§! in the nearby breakaway state of §YSen Kinh§!.\n\nWhere other cities such as Rhapsody, Fragrance, and even the imperial capital of §YVermilion§! grew up and out into dense cities, Verdant capitalizes on its unique geography by spreading out across the Great Mellifluve, with raised communities perched on the many islands and the flat riverbanks, causing the city to completely dominate the mouth of the river. Spread out as it is, roads within and around the city are small and scarce; rather, the kirin of Verdant travel from place to place using hundreds of canals and thousands of small boats. This serves them well during the spring flood season, where the banks of the Great Mellifluve swell and the river can rise as high as ten meters, submerging any surface roads for weeks at a time. To combat this, the buildings of Verdant are raised on wooden and bamboo stilts that keep them elevated above the Great Mellifluve in all but the worst floods. When the river is at its highest during the flooding season, the islands in its waters disappear, and the raised buildings appear to float on the water, thus giving rise to its second moniker: §CThe City that Floats§!.\n\nThe collapse of river trade during the institution of §RThe Silence§! took a great toll on the city's economy. Without a reliable stream of goods and trade flowing down the river toward the city, Verdant's economy sharply contracted, forcing the growing capitalist and industrialist classes to flee north to Fragrance, the city that still desperately tried to maintain trade relations with the rest of Zebrica, and so the best remaining hope for the businesskirin to hold onto what assets they had left. As for the rest of the kirin in Verdant, many migrated out of the city into the surrounding farmlands to take up subsistence farming, or slowly isolated themselves into one of the city's many island communities, taking up fishing to survive. With the city fragmenting into dozens, if not hundreds of communities isolated by water and canals, it was perhaps a surprise to find that the city did not suffer or decline too greatly in power and influence in the region. Seeing the resilience of their city, many priests and mystics of §CThe Way of Fire§! took this as a sign that The Silence could yet be compatible with the teachings of §GConcord§!, and pointed toward the communalism of the city's communities for proof. Over the decades, this way of thinking has created a new sect of The Way of Fire known as §CThe Rising Fire§!, which argues that improved and reorganized communal societies can keep the realm strong while also paying homage to Concord and abiding by the decrees of The Silence. For now, the priests and mystics of The Rising Fire only hold sway over Verdant and the cities connected to the western branches of the Great Mellifluve, but were The Silence to end, surely they would begin to take their ideas further inland and spread their teachings far and wide.\n"

Even in the tumultuous centuries before §CThe Way of Fire§! had unified Kiria, Chrysanthemum had avoided the worst of the bloodshed and violence commonplace throughout the realm, for few built-up towns and settlements inhabited the rural western countryside, and thus organised conflict between different kirin communities rarely erupted.\n\nIn those times, the settlement of Chrysanthemum served as an informal hub for riverine trade along the western tributaries of the §YGreat Mellifluve§!.

state_lore_text_container_state_description_1054:0 "At the center of this great Zaikirian city stands the §CCitadel of the Lotus§!, an ancient structure maintained for centuries as a fortress-monastery for the priests of the Southern Way. At its center lies the §OShrine of the Flaming Lotus§!, a small altar with a jade box said to contain a perpetually burning lotus blossom — proof of Concord's Divine Will. From this sacred place, the monastery expanded outwards, with other temples built around the central shrine, followed by walls to protect it all. To protect the monastery and the spark housed within, the wood-and-earth architecture of the fortress and its walls were supplemented by fortified stone baileys and citadels surrounded by open fields, meticulously cultivated to be pleasure gardens in peacetime that could be razed and prepared to become deadly killing fields during a siege. Moats were also carved to provide water to the inner sanctum, and to provide another line of defense. Soon, the complex outgrew its first ring of defence, and another layer had to be built. This would repeat a total of §Ythree times§!, with each ring of fortifications representing another age of the city's history. In accordance with the Divine Will of Concord, these sacred rings were built to resemble the petals of a §Plotus flower§!, showing that the burning blossom would always be the city's sacred heart.\n\nWhile the kirin in the north were eventually able to unify under the teachings of §CThe Way of Fire§!, the various city-states of §YZaikiria§! remained fractured and hostile towards each other for a far longer time, even as the religion of §GConcord§! began to permeate into the south. Of these city-states, the cities of §YLotus§! and §YBlossom§! were two of the strongest, and often utilized the smaller city-states between them to engage in regional §Rproxy wars§! to prevent the other from growing too sharply in power and influence. This age of warring states was soon put on hold around 800 ALB when the influence of the §OVermilion Dynasty§! managed to effectively assert itself over the kirin city-states and warlords in the region of §Ysouthern Kiria§!, bringing these kirin into the fold as semi-autonomous protectorates under the jurisdiction of the divine §GMatriarch Superior§! in Vermilion. Given enough time, Zaikiria would have been absorbed into the kirin realm proper, with Lotus being the last hold out of the region, but the abrupt arrival of §RThe Silence§! brought about by rapid modernization of the Vermilion Realm severed the Matriarch's influence in the region. Without the unifying force of the Vermilion Realm's influence to hold them together, the city-states of Zaikiria once again split apart into violent rivalries and fighting.\n\nLotus found itself in a peculiar situation following the establishment of The Silence in the northern realm. A large portion of kirin §Gintellectuals and capitalists§! fled to the city from the Matriarch's realm, trying to find a new home among kirin lands that was free of the oppressive policies of The Silence. This core group of educated kirin became just the tool that Lotus' warlord, §GCinder Tempest§!, would need to expand and solidify his power over Lotus and Zaikiria as a whole. Occupying the Citadel of the Lotus Crown as his headquarters and assimilating these educated kirin into his court, Cinder Tempest embarked on a long §Rcampaign of conquest§! that marched northwards, subjugating each of the Zaikirian city-states in turn, until he finally sacked and subdued Lotus' long-time rival of Blossom.\n\nCinder Tempest returned to Lotus with the spoils of his conquest of Blossom and declared himself King of Sen Kinh and §CBearer of the Lotus Crown§!. Lotus became the capital of his new kingdom, and to celebrate his achievements, Cinder subverted the beliefs of the Southern Way of Fire and declared himself a divine ruler akin to the Matriarch Superior in the north. With his divine authority firmly established, Cinder used the Southern Way as a tool to §Ymaintain social control§! over his new realm, preventing it from falling apart after his death.\n\nNowadays, Lotus remains the seat of the Kingdom of Sen Kinh, though its influence and authority over the rest of the region is beginning to wane as the city-states once again §Ragitate for independence§!. And with The Silence ending in northern Kiria and the Realm of Kiria §Ywaking from its slumber§!, the Bearer of the Lotus Crown will have to tread carefully to maintain Lotus' supremacy over the rest of Zaikiria... and its own independence from a resurgent Vermilion Realm.\n"

Caught between the unified §YRealm of Kiria§! and the squabbling city-states of §YZaikiria§!, Blossom has long had to play off of the strengths and weaknesses of its neighbors to survive. Before the divine gaze of the kirin §GMatriarch Superior§! turned her attention to the south, Blossom engaged in an endless series of proxy wars and regional conflicts with its biggest rival, the city-state of §YLotus§!, to the south of the Zaikiria region. But as §CThe Way of Fire§! unified the northern kirin realm and began to spread southwards, Blossom found itself as the first target of an expanding kirin hegemony over the south. As the religion of the north began to permeate the city and its society at every level, the local leaders of Blossom soon found themselves unable to withstand the growing influence of the north in their dominion, and soon were forced to swear fealty to the Matriarch Superior of Kiria, lest the city collapse into open revolt fueled by the religion of The Way of Fire. Blossom found itself established as the §OVermilion Realm's§! power base in the south as the capital of the §YCommandery of Zaikiria§!, from where it could continue to exert its influence and authority over the region. Temples to the fire goddess §GConcord§! replaced any and all shrines to previous gods and deities, and a powerful clergy soon found itself vying for control of the city with its old leaders. As the years went on, the kirin of Blossom soon started seeing themselves as kirin of the Vermilion Realm, and had §RThe Silence§! not severed all imperial influence in the region, the full annexation of the city into the realm may very well have happened.\n\nWhen The Silence destroyed the authority and influence of the Matriarch Superior in Kiria, Blossom found itself in a §Rcrisis of identity§!. Many kirin in the city believed that, as a bastion of the Matriarch's influence in the south, they should abide by the decrees of The Silence and follow the example of their northern brethren. The kirin who had long hoped for independence from the north, however, saw this as an opportunity to once more establish the dominance of Blossom in Zaikiria. The internal divisions within the city left it weak and ill-prepared to resist the advances of the other Zaikirian city-states, and it was not long before §RCinder Tempest§!, a warlord from the city-state of Lotus, stormed Blossom's walls and sacked the city. Instead of The Silence affording Blossom a chance to rise into renewed glory, it only brought about the ruination of the northernmost city-state, and it was forced to swear fealty to a master for a second time, this time from the south. Its populace humiliated and its valuables looted, it would be a long time before another opportunity to reclaim its former glory would come to the city-state.\n\nNowadays, however, the authority of the Sen Kinhese kings in Lotus is waning, and §Ywhispers of independence§! are once more beginning to travel along Blossom's streets. But a resurgent §YRealm of Kiria§! to the north also poses new risks to the once-proud city-state. For yet again, Blossom finds itself at a crossroads, its future §Yuncertain§!, and the kirin in the streets holding their breath as they watch the situation around them develop.\n"

state_lore_text_container_state_description_1083:0 "In the dark days before §YKirian unification§! under the §OWay of Fire§! and the §CMatriarchs Superior§!, Kiria was a land of anarchy, warfare, and devastation. Regional warlords and petty tyrants ruled over a myriad of incessantly warring fiefdoms through terror and violence. It was away from this landscape of fear and tears that a steady trickle of kirin peasantry made their way south to the §GZaikirian frontier§! — a sparsely-populated and untamed land yet-untouched by the nirik warlordism that ravaged Kiria.\n\nIt was on the northern bank of the §CMarekong River§! that the furthest kirin settlement in the south of Zaikiria — §OMadrepore§! — was founded during the beginning of the 6th century. Refugees from Kiria Proper had established settlements all throughout the Zaikirian interior and coastline, but Madrepore's favourable location at the mouth of the Marekong River, its expansive deepwater harbour, and a general consensus among the refugee diaspora that the settlement — situated, far away from the chaos of the homeland they had fled, in the southernmost reaches of Zaikiria — was as auspicious a place to put down roots as any, meant that it attracted a significant influx of kirin immigrants that would only increase as Madrepore grew in size.\n\nWhile the kirin settlements in the territories of what would later become known as §PKhamrin§! determinedly rejected any form of central government to maintain the sovereignty and independence of each settlement, the informal and hidden forces of trade, commerce, and population exchange meant that Madrepore, making full use of its geographical advantages, was able to §Ydominate the smaller inland polities§! in economic, cultural, and therefore, political, terms. While the member-settlements of the §PLeague of Khamrin§! each retain and maintain their own standing militia-armies in accordance with the §YTreaty of Terramare§!, thus ensuring a significant degree of local autonomy and self-rule, it is undeniable that Madrepore is the lynchpin and mainspring of the League.\n\nMadrepore's location also made it the primary site for cross-cultural exchange between the kirin settlers and the §Yzebra natives of the Far South§!. Even after Kirian unification, Madrepore, far away from Vermilion, escaped the all-encompassing influence of the Way of Fire that would become a permanent defining feature of society and politics in kirin civilisation. The legend of the §RThunder Tiger§! — the powerful, incomprehensible, and all-too-real mystical deity which protects the §YGolden Temple§! — would inspire the kirin of Khamrin to come to terms with the §Onirik state§! by their own means.\n\nThe Khamrini kirin interpreted stories of zebra villagers living in the vicinity of the Golden Temple who, upon encountering would-be looters or tomb raiders, would attack them in a fit of §Rpsychotic rage§! attributed to possession by the §RThunder Tiger§!, to conceive of the §Onirik state§! as something caused by spiritual or mystical forces beyond the control of ordinary kirin. Unlike the Kirian §CWay of Fire§!, which stigmatised the nirik state and mandated the ostracisation of those who had lapsed, the Khamrini §PSect of Southerly Lumination§! tolerated those kirin who had turned nirik, holding that they were not at fault for losing control of their selves, while maintaining that a kirin who turned nirik had a moral and civic duty to compensate those among their peers who had suffered injury as a result of their lapse.\n\nThe authority of the doctrine of the Sect of Southerly Lumination among the Khamrini kirin meant that it came to serve a similar political, if not as strictly absolutist, role as the Way of Fire in Kiria — as an arbitrator, and occasional arbiter, in disputes initially relating to lapses into the nirik state, but whose remit eventually expanded to encompass matters of civics, commerce, and culture. Although the §Yindustrialisation of Khamrin§! and the emergence of a new social class of capitalists, businessmares, and traders would eventually, peacefully and over time, put an end to the Sect's monopoly on political power, the priests and mystics of the Southerly Lumination still constitute a formidable and well-entrenched interest group in Madreporean and Khamrini politics today.\n\nMadrepore has miles of §Cdocklands, wharves, and shipyards§!, along both banks of the Marekong River as well as on the shores of the city's deepwater harbour. The headquarters of the Madrepore Merchant Marine are located in the heart of the metropolis, alongside the §LBastion of the Lantern§!, which houses the archives and bureaucracy of the Southerly Lumination. The §GDiet of the Khamrini League§! is also situated in Madrepore, making it the de-facto capital of the League, although the stately palace in which it is housed, constructed out of wood and stone in traditional 8th-century Zaikirian architectural style, is overshadowed by neighbouring modern neo-Pegasopolian edifices housing the head offices of Madreporean corporate §Yparastatals§! and conglomerates. Significant too is the §RCaliginous Penitentiary§! on the outskirts of the metropolis, a prison and work camp where those who had lapsed into the nirik state — and were unable to pay the charges levied by the Southerly Lumination for absolution from their transgression — strive to earn their redemption through hard labour.\n"

Founded as an outpost by §CMarco Talonostra§! at the mouth of the Arneo river, Talononte has grown greatly over the centuries. After the death of §CArantigos,§! Marco and his successors began to expand the city, transforming it into a small, yet prominent, center of trade. However, as the Talonostras' power waned in the 2nd century BLB, so too did the city's wealth. The §RDeath of King Marus§! in 34 BLB was the final straw, and the §Rcivil war§! that followed left the city devastated, marking the beginning of the city's §R"Dark Age,"§! which would continue until the 2nd century ALB, when the revival of trade routes between §YWingbardy§! and §YAquileia§! would allow the city to return to its former splendor. This newfound prosperity would continue to increase with the §GUnification of Talouse§! under §CGiovanni di Chiazbini§! in 602 ALB and its designation as the new nation's capital. Talouse's peaceful submission to §OGrover I§! and Talononte's relative isolation from the rest of the §OEmpire§! meant that it remained mostly unchanged during Imperial rule, and that very little Groverian influence found its way into the city. \n\nThe city today has still managed to retain much of its ancient charm, in spite of the advances of modernity. The historical center houses much of the pre-Groverian architecture, which is an interesting blend of §YWingbardian, Aquileian, Transfolinian§! and even §YSparletan§! styles. This blend is most clearly displayed in the temples dedicated to the §GTrinity§!, which include pointed Aquileian arches, and even Sparletan domes. Even deeper into the city lies the §CCentro Storico§!, which houses some of the last vestiges of Arantigan-era architecture in Griffonia, including the §YPiazza Talonostra,§! which is purported to be the site of Talonostra's first camp, and the ruins of the §YPrimo Tempio§!, an ancient temple dedicated to §CArantigos-Boreas§! that has lain abandoned for centuries. However, far from the majesty of history lies the modern Talononte. In the new city center lies the §GPalazzo Ducale§!, a small, yet beautiful, §YAquilo-Folinian§! palace that houses the royal family, and the §YParliament Building,§! one of the few fully modern-Wingbardian buildings in the whole city. Surrounding them are some of the country's first skyscrapers, office blocks, and modern buildings, which bear some resemblance to those found in the urban cores of §YFrancistria§! and §YWrobert§!. Beyond the downtown lie vast suburbs composed of countless apartment blocks and slums that house the city's workers. This is Talononte's dark underbelly, where the §RMafia thrives, socialists rule, and crime is rampant.§! Meanwhile, smokestacks and industrial blocks line the Arneo, pouring smoke into the sky, and polluting the river's waters as the city's burgeoning industrial sector continues to grow and expand. \n\nThe city's peaceful appearance makes it hard to believe that it was the stage of one of the largest §Rstrikes§! in Griffonian history, as thousands of workers made their way down the streets to demand improved conditions. Although the marchers are now back at work, their impact can still be felt, as an uneasy tension hangs over the city.

Yet its true era of significance would not come until centuries later.\n\nSome years after the founding of §GNew Mareland§!, ponies began to migrate into the city from the west. They brought their higher literacy and prosperity with them, and thus became members of the middle and upper classes. Close trade ties were established with Equestria and the city began to grow rapidly. This accelerated exponentially when the ponies brought the §RIndustrial Revolution§! to Wrobert, making it the first city in all of southern Griffonia to industrialize. The city's famed port was greatly expanded, factories were built and griffons flooded in from the countryside. Soon, Wrobert became a city that rivaled Karthin itself.\n\nWhile Karthin is the traditional and political capital of Wingbardy, some would argue that Wrobert is the economic heart of the nation. Most of Wingbardy's imports and exports pass through the city, and it is home to important shipyards, business districts and industrial companies.

After the declaration of independence in 972 ALB, the old architecture has been extensively renovated, much to the delight of Equestrian tourists.\n\nThe large proletarian population and close ties to Equestria proved to be fertile ground for §Rcommunist movements§!, so it is no surprise that Wrobert is the home of the §RPCW§!. The city's council has the highest portion of leftists out of any Wingbardian city, and there have even been socialist mayors in the past. Yet in recent years, the §LBlackwings§! have been gathering support in the city, spreading propaganda that is aimed at the wealthy ponies.

This has contributed to the economic downturn that Wrobert is suffering from at the moment of writing. This in turn has further radicalised the city's working populace, so clashes between communists and fascists have become a daily occurrence.

Indeed, the first encounters between the two races occured near §YFort Acorn§!, the predecessor to the city itself that was founded by Equestrian settlers who colonized the uninhabited wilderness of northwestern Equestria. Different sources explain the nature of these outcomes differently. According to Equestrian historiography, it was cautious but ultimately friendly, as ponies presented gifts to the strange shapeshifting creatures. Traditionally, Changeling records did not mention gifts, but during the reign of §GQueen Chrysalis§! history has been reinterpreted and the encounters are seen as hostile and even violent.\n\nWhatever the case, the fort soon became a trading post, and then a town. It was the only place in Equestria where ponies could acquire finely woven §GChangeling silk§!, so commerce boomed and thousands of migrants arrived. Changelings arrived in the city as well, initially living in a separate quarter but soon integrating into the populace, often shapeshifting into ponies to fit in better. Acornage was - and still is - the one place in the world where one can see changeling hive spires next to traditional Equestrian houses.\n\nWhen the changelings were unified under one nation in 982 ALB, the border of the newborn country was drawn right next to the city. Equestrians agreed to Chrysalis' demands, thinking it would be the foundation of a friendly relationship between the two nations. They would later regret this when relations soured and the complete lack of a buffer zone made the city strategically vulnerable. Despite the rising tensions, business in the city continued as usual, with the local changelings and ponies remaining on friendly terms. This changed in §R1002 ALB§!, when Canterlot itself came under attack. The treacherous stab at the heart of Equestria shocked everypony, especially the inhabitants of Acornage. Overnight, the mood in the city changed, and many saw changelings as unreliable and a potential fifth column. Racial harmony was replaced with racial tensions, and thousands of fearful changelings fled the city across the border.\n\nAfter the initial harsh reactions, the situation calmed down as Chrysalis licked her wounds in Vesalipolis. There was an attempt at making amends, but most citizens felt like there was no going back. Yet, deep in their hearts, the inhabitants of Acorange know that their home city is proof that changelings and ponies can not only get along, but be true friends with one another."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_1093:0 "In the seventh century Before Luna's Banishment, when Colthaginian traders looked north towards Griffonia, another city founded a fort at the bay which later grew into Kizil-Zeb. §YZur§! was Colthage's ancient and legendary rival, and Kizil-Zeb was a gambit to whisk eastern trade away from their more dominant neighbour. The fort, named §GMetzudah§!, and her natural harbour provided a safe haven for Macawian and Hindian ships, after which their wealth was directed towards the mother city. As the Zonic wars raged between Colthage and Karthin, Zur profited and eventually became the hegemonic power in Northern Zebrica, which caused the colonists from Kizil-Zeb to project power over the area now known as §GColtva§!.\n\nZur's prominence did not last, however, and exactly six hundred years after Metzudah was founded, §GKizil-Zeb declared independence from the mother city§!, only for Colthage to eventually come to exert influence over Coltva yet again. Influences from Hindia and Macawia, along with the old legacy of Zur, meant that Colthage never fully managed to culturally absorb Coltva, and especially during the rule of the Quagga Khans over Zonicia, the two cultures diverted. The advent of modernity and the §Ratrocities committed§! during the fight against the Storm King fuelled Coltvan unrest and cemented the Coltvan identity in opposition to Colthaginian culture.\n\nKizil-Zeb itself is exemplary of the history of Coltva. As many of the larger Coltvan towns, §Ya colonial fort stood in the centre§!, although modern government buildings and houses now dot the old Metzudah quarter. Eventually, Coltvan culture seeped into the city, until only buildings remained of Zur's legacy. Around the city centre, §Ywinding narrow streets§! are flanked by high, sometimes overhanging buildings with dizzying colours, inspired by Macawian, Hindian and Zur architecture over the centuries. Look closely, and you might find old houses doubling as warehouses which belonged to harpy or deer merchants. Small plazas with fountains and shady trees keep the city liveable in the hot summer, if you know where to find them. To a Colthaginian, Kizil-Zeb is a little too different from home than it should be, an overwhelming mix of styles, accents and impressions, but for Coltvans, it is their §Glittle capital.§!"

state_lore_text_container_state_description_1196:0 "From its earliest days as the seat of a moderately prosperous trade confederation, the island of what is now known as §GBelle-Île§! has been described as a beacon of charity and a haven for wayward travellers. Having few reasons to go to war with one another, the nations that formed upon her shores would instead prefer to turn their attention towards the outside, opening their ports to travellers and letting a myriad of goods flow between themselves and the hundreds of isles dotting the archipelago. So great was their splendour and so high their acclaim that, during the early days of intercontinental exploration, they became a popular stopping-off point for both established and emerging naval powers of the age. From Sicameonese traders to Equestrian explorers, their generosity and unwavering cultural tolerance had transformed them into a beacon of multiculturalism in the Meridian.\n\nThis tolerance, combined with their deeply interpersonal political system, would ultimately lead to their absorption into Saddle Arabia through a series of diplomatic maneuvers, with the rest of the isles following not long after. Under Arabian control, the island, now known as Alluwlua would stand to gain much from its new liege. In the capitol city of Mina' Alsalahif, for example, Saddle Arabian architecture would flourish, intertwining with the local style to create some of the most remarkable landmarks in the city. In the countryside, many established farming settlements would find themselves increasingly centered around families deemed worthy of Arabian investments, granted at the caretaker's discretion. As time passed and trade routes drifted out of favor, the island would continue to do its best to keep up with the times, always finding a way to continue turning a profit despite the changing times. \n\nThis stagnation would continue for some time until the year §Y785 ALB§!, when Alluwlua, along with all of the minor islands surrounding it, was given as a wedding gift to Queen Giselda of the Discret family. The transfer proved to be a great boon to the island's local economy and for many years, the newly renamed capitol of §GPort Giselda§! would see unprecedented growth and expansion as prospective members of Aquileian society would set up shop. It was not until 200 years later, during the crisis of the §RFirst Revolution§!, that the nation would finally find itself on the tail end of its latest golden age. With Aquileian imports being unavailable as long as the king remained in exile, the Colony was forced to dip into its savings in order to keep many businesses afloat. Even then, 5 years of Republican rule on the mainland took its toll on the young nation and even now, years after §GMaréchal Berthelot§! launched his fateful counter-revolution to restore the Discrets to the throne, some parts of the island are only just beginning to recover. If the island is to regain its former glory, changes are going to have to be made."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_743:0 "Long ago, the first §PWarzenans§!, exhausted from their grueling journey, came upon a lush riverine land. There, at the confluence of the §4Zadin and Menuch rivers§!, the voices of the gods spoke to them and they knew they had found salvation. They quickly settled there, naming their new home §rZamivgazal§! - literally meaning "confluence of the gods" - and thus Warzena was born. Situated between the great §3Zonician cities§! and §FMaregypt§!, Zamivgazal was perfectly positioned to take advantage of the rich trade routes connecting them. By the 9th century BLB, it had grown into a proper market town in tandem with the construction of the §6First Temple§!; a truly awe-inspiring monument to the gods and a wonder in its own right. However, these good times eventually came to an end as the great powers of §LColthage§! and §FMaregypt§! fell, casting the city into a long torpor. After centuries of dormancy, the city's slumber was broken by the invasion of the §gQuaggatai§!; who destroyed the First Temple and left the city in ruins. Under their rule, a new peace was established, which allowed the city to recover and even thrive as it had so long ago. Even so, the Warzenans resented their masters and were quick to join Zinuzel Zidalid's rebellion, which saw their independence restored. In celebration, a §8Second Temple§! was built, even more opulent and grandiose than the First.\n\nHowever, times were different now. The ancient trade routes that had given the city its wealth had either shifted away or withered up which, combined with the enormous costs of building the new temple, caused the city to begin a slow and painful §tdecline§!, made worse by a successive line of inept and ineffective kings. By the turn of the 11th century, however, there was a new king on the throne - §GZamaliahon XVI§! - who in a few short years managed to breath new life into the city. It seemed that Zamivgazal was poised for a grand rebirth that would allow it to more than surpass its former glories.\n\nBut that all changed when the §CStorm King§! attacked.\n\nHis armada quickly tore through the city, looting anything of value and §Orazing§! the rest. The Second Temple was reduced to ash and rubble, while the reformer king was §tslain§! in his palace, leaving the nation's hopes seemingly dead with him. Although the conqueror was defeated a few months later, the damage had already been done.\n\nToday, Zamivgazal is very much defined by the events of 1005, as large parts of the city remain in shambles. Many ancient neighborhoods, including the §7central square§! and the §HCourtiers' Quarter§!, have been damaged beyond repair while the sites of the §RTemples§! remain barren rubble heaps. Even so, the city has held on and all hope is not yet lost. The §4Zadin river§! - now fully encompassed by the nascent metropolis - was able to survive mostly unharmed, with its centuries-old manors and §Griverside gardens§! still intact. The city's northeastern areas were spared most of the destruction and now house its newest developments, as entrepreneurs slowly return to build §Ynew factories§! while tenements are raised to house the country's burgeoning proletariat class. Indeed, there is light in the darkness, and - gods willing - Zamivgazal may yet rise to its former heights once again."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_775:0 "Traditionally, the §rKingdom of Abyssinia§! had a mobile §Yitinerant capital§!, as the royal court moved across the Kingdom to govern it more effectively. As such, there was no official "capital city" for many centuries. This changed after the §YClawomonic Restoration§!, as Queen Mewodora II decided to establish a permanent capital city in 901 ALB to modernize and centralize her realm. She started the construction of a grand royal palace in a city called Panthera.\n\nIt is unclear when Panthera was founded, as it originated as a small market town on the Panther river. It was chosen as a capital due to its relatively central location and proximity to both the coastline and the trade routes that crossed the desert to the Arabian Sea. It expanded rapidly during Queen Mewodora's reign and was practically rebuilt from the ground up as the first truly modern city in all of Abyssinia with the help of §PWingbardian companies§!. As such, its streets are well-lit and carefully planned, its buildings are tall and there is even some plumbing. Countless irrigation channels were dug around the city to create pastures for cattle, so there would be enough food for every cat. However, as the city grew and attracted countless artisans, shopkeepers and slaves, its outskirts turned into crowded slums with traditional circular mud huts. The city is strictly divided into neighbourhoods (sefer) which are clearly divided by wealth, with aristocat and bureaucat neighborhoods appearing completely different from working class ones.\n\nThe royal palace eventually became famous for all the wealth stored in its treasury. This unsurprisingly attracted the attention of a certain Yeti known as the §CStorm King§!, who invaded Abyssinia. Panthera was the last bastion of resistance to fall, and many buildings were burned down during the attack. The cats had no counter to the yetis' airships however and §YKing Gomez§! decided to surrender to save his subjects from further suffering. The Storm King then completely emptied the royal treasury and promptly left, leaving behind a devastated capital city.\n\nRebuilding efforts have already begun and many cats are picking up the pieces on their own as the government remains paralyzed. While the city remains calm, there are clear signs of anxiety and discontent in the air, with restless slaves, growing food prices and ruins scattered everywhere. It is impossible to tell if the city will be able to recover from the Storm King's wrath."

There are some ruins that might be from the period of the ancient §YMaregyptian Pharaohs§!, which would mean ponies have lived there for over a thousand years. The village only rose to prominence after the §rKingdom of Abyssinia§! seized the lands during §YQueen Pawkuno's§! reign in 10 ALB. Two years later, she chose Coltoba as the location of a provincial capital which would be the residence of the governor of §GManedalusia§!. The small village would quickly grow to become a notable regional port town.\n\nWhen §GSaddle Arabia§! invaded Abyssinia, Manedalusia was the first region their soldiers managed to take. While they managed to push deeper into the feline kingdom, they suffered from severe attrition in the mountains. In 672 ALB, a peace treaty was signed where Abyssinia became a tributary of Saddle Arabia and Manedalusia was ceded to them. Soon after, Coltoba became the capital of a newly established §Yautonomous region§! which would be dominated by Saddle Arabian merchants. A new trade route was established, with countless ships sailing from the north and unloading their goods, which were taken by caravans across the desert to Klugetown and then to Farasrah or Timbucktu, and vice versa. This was the golden age of Manedalusia: Coltoba grew to a considerable size and wealthy merchants funded the construction of madrashas and the Great Watrazi Temple. Soon the city became the heart of a new Manedalusian culture, which mixed Maregyptian language, culture and religion with Saddle Arabian ones.\n\nGood times do not last forever. After the §RClawomonic Restoration§! in 901 ALB, Abyssinia ceased to pay tribute to the ever-weakening and decadent Saddle Arabia. Unrest grew in Maregypt, culminating in the §RBirthday Revolt§! in 987 ALB, where the independent §YKingdom of Maregypt§! was established. The two kingdoms both had claims on Manedalusia, which remained loyal to Saddle Arabia, so chaos ensued. According to Maregypt, Abyssinian troops illegally crossed into Manedalusia, which prompted a swift mobilization and response from the ponies who wanted to "save" their "fellow estranged Maregyptians" from the feline slavers. Thus in 988 ALB, the brutal §RManedalusian War§! was fought and ended in a stalemate, with Manedalusia partitioned between the two Kingdoms. A ceasefire was signed which has lasted to this day, but it is an uneasy peace as both sides - and especially the local Manedalusians - are unhappy with it. Coltoba is a powderkeg ready to explode, as the locals despise their feline overlords who have enslaved thousands of ponies."

Yet despite this, it never lost the tranquil charm that came with the land surrounding it.\n\nDue to its proximity to the jungles of the Equestrian Southeast, Stableside has a §Ydecently-sized minority population§! of §2thestrals§! and what some refer to as the §Gnative ponies§! of the region, though the local culture has become its own unique, yet still harmonious blend. Minor tensions that existed elsewhere in Equestria did not seem to affect Stableside, as its residents believed in friendship and harmony above all else.\n\nPerhaps it was due to this belief in harmony that the formation of a group known as the §OFriendship Lodge§! was so notable. Founded in 993 by a pony named Sunday School, the Friendship Lodge began as a simple §Yponytarian organization§! who desired to help one another throughout their daily struggles. Their acts of charity in the name of §PCelestia§! steadily garnered a following, as nearly everypony could agree that the princess of the sun was a good pony and that helping others was also good. Non-members often found their §Yborderline obsession with Celestia§!, her teachings, and to a lesser extent §rTwilight Sparkle§!'s recently published §PJournal of Friendship§! to be grating at best, though there has been nothing to suggest that the Friendship Lodge has any ulterior motives. Despite §Yclaiming to not be a religion§!, the Friendship Lodge's influence has begun to expand beyond their ponytarian origins, even going so far as to encourage its members to donate a small portion of their income to the organization, while at the same time opening the occasional business. By 1004, they had begun to send "§Yfriendship envoys§!" to other cities, even other nations in attempts to promote their beliefs.\n\nAt the dawn of 1006, §CStableside§! had become quite the tourist destination for the wider Equestrian populace, leading to the city's economy becoming truly prosperous.

As Equestria grew under those first years under Luna and Celestia, so did Canterlot, and with them, the prominence of unicorns in the Equestrian system. When Equestria industrialized and grew past the years of medieval castles and nobles, Canterlot did too, and the unicorns adapted to a new world of politicians and bureaucrats, finding new ways to cement their natural primacy over the lesser races. When Luna was welcomed into the fold, it happened in Canterlot, and the unicorns were the first to welcome their long-lost diarch back into the nation, §Reven as the pegasi and earth ponies rejected her§!. Be it during the battle against Nightmare Moon, the battle against the Changelings, or indeed, as it has been for most of its history, the vibrant capital of Equestria, the home of ponies and Harmony, watched over by Princess Celestia's gaze and a unicorn's guiding hoof, Canterlot has always been a snapshot of Equestria and its condition.\n\nBut indeed, if you took up the railroad to Canterlot, arriving at the palace, you will find the curriculum at the School for Gifted Unicorns revitalized like it never has been before, and the galas at the Canterlot Palace have been overhauled to tailor to unicorns and their changeling friends, with the lesser races excluded from attendance. Finally, after so long, the history of Equestria now reveals the truth of unicorn primacy, and does away with the insidious lie that all equine races were created equal. The unicorns of Equestria have weathered the storm of oppression and forced equality for centuries, and now, it is time to step into the light and assume our rightful place in the sun.\n\nOnly time will tell what will happen to Canterlot, at the dawn of the era of the Pax Chrysalia — an era of industrial opportunity, interracial harmony, and mutual prosperity.\n"

Rather, the mountainous region itself was the primary home of the dragons. From here, the reigning Dragon Lord would preside over any decisions made for the bands who lived upon the isles. It was not the only land that dragons called home, but it was where they were most comfortable. After ceding the Badlands to Equestria shortly before the Great War, they remained neutral in the fight between Chrysalis and Celestia, as well as the later wars that were waged by the Solar Empire.\n\nNeutrality did not serve them well, however, and through great loss of life, they were driven off the islands by Cobalt Hoof shortly after his liberation of the South-East. In the wake of this war, they left behind a scorched land to prevent any modicum of use out of it by their would-be conquerors. This suited Cobalt Hoof's plans perfectly.\n\nAs the Dragon Isles were isolated, they could be guarded with minimal investment, and soon the first political prisoners and prisoners of the secession war were sent to the island. In this first wave, Dragonclaw and its sister prisons were established, with Dragonclaw becoming the administration center for the island, as well as its most fortified location. Only the worst prisoners—according to COBSOC—will ever end up in Dragonclaw, and for good reason. The facility itself is built into the taller of the two mountain peaks, with only a solitary road winding its way up to the prison. Along the way, numerous guard posts ward against deviation and wandering from the path and overlook the areas that could feasibly be navigated by terrestrial races.\n\nThat is, of course, if the prisoner in question could even escape the prison itself.

state_lore_text_container_state_description_11:0 "Yakistown's history is centuries' old, to the first settlements of the western Yaks, known as the Mangchijids. From there, they formed a power base that allowed them to exert control over some of the polar bears and renegade changelings that wandered too far into the valley around the town. While these broad strokes paint a picture of power and majesty, it remains difficult to fully decipher fact from fiction, as the Yaks themselves keep no written records of its occupation. Instead, they rely upon oral teachings and stories, some of which contain dubious embellishments ranging from mythical snow birds providing relief from a fire that raged through the city to the gods themselves reaching down to bless each khan that ruled the city.\n\nMore modern records confirm that the city has been permanently settled since at least the late 700s, if not earlier. From it, raids by the Mangchijids occasionally ventured as far south as Equestria, but primarily went north or west to pester the polar bears and changelings. In 971, the Kingdom of Yakyakistan moved its capital from Saihan Tolgod to Yakistown after successive territorial losses from griffon settlers under Prince Winford.\n\nAfter being rebuilt in 1005 under the last Yak Prince, Rutherford, it was soon involved with more bloodshed, first with the civil war between the yaks and the rogue clans led by the Jakichikh, then in a defensive campaign against the imperial ambitions of Field Marshal Erwin Highhill. It was one of the last campaigns that the griffon fought, and while he avoided as much damage as possible, the yaks refused to go peacefully. Much of the city was, again, destroyed in 1017 in the northern war.\n\nWith the city pacified, griffon workers and architects began to build it in their own species' characteristic, lofty style, but were thrown out after Highill perished in 1020 and the Western Griffonian Empire fractured in his wake. What parts of the city that were untouched in the war remain in the Equestrian style like Rutherford ordered. There are sections that match the griffon architecture in Weterheim or Neu-Griffenheim, and then much of the remainder has returned to the traditional thatch and wood that make up yak settlements.\n\nThis mishmash of architecture has not been lost on the yaks. Successive campaigns to return the city to the yak way have met with marginal success. Tradition or not, yaks don't like being evicted from their homes just because it happens to look like a non-yak house.\n\nVisitors today are few and far between, as the two yak warlords that have claimed the old territories of the kingdom frequently fight over who is the true successor of Prince Rutherford. For those that do travel here, they are greeted by little in the way of anything warm. For a majority of the year, snow can at least be seen falling from the sky, if not accumulating on the ground and blowing into white wisps to be blown against the yaks walking through the streets. One of the biggest draws is the idiosyncratic architecture, but after that is the remaining yak statue that marks the old entrance to the city. During the Northern War, the defending yaks miscalculated a volley of artillery, which impacted the western yak. Today there only remains the base and the broken legs from where the wooden monument stood.\n\nAlthough there are not many draws for the architectural buff or the historian, yak culture is still visible in droves. Respectful visitors may attend some of the local eateries to experience national foods such as the buuz, a dumpling that contains various herbs, spices, and turnips or other hardy vegetables. While they will offer non-yaks alcoholic beverages, it is advisable to not accept them, or drink in small quantities, as most beers will be fifteen percent alcohol by volume, and they will not skimp on glass sizes. Additional cultural highlights for the curious include the annual Yickslurbertfest, where yaks stomp on anything and everything they can find—not that they don't already—and yovidaphone concerts."

Although the city itself started as a small, seasonal fishing village across the Eclipse Gulf from Fillydelphia, it has become one of the largest urban areas on all of Equus, surpassing the great Class-1 Megalopolises in the Solar Empire.\n\nBefore the Great War, the old city of Baltimare was a hotbed of issues, characterized by unrest motivated by the success of the Winter Revolution in Stalliongrad. Some of this was silenced during the war, but the treatment of workers became an issue again under Daybreaker, fomenting in the eventual uprising that led to the formation of the South-Eastern Governorate. Baltimare provided much of the early supplies for the civil war, and for its part, was bombarded by the Imperial Armada for months.\n\nAfter the civil war, the city lay in ruin, but was quickly rebuilt by Cobalt Hoof, starting with its heavy industry and dockyards. As the city expanded, the suburbs encroached on more and more of the jungle, and new factories regurgitated toxic waste into watersheds and ponds.\n\nThe outskirts today are like their own city, with multiple districts controlled by those directly appointed by Cobalt Hoof. As a mishmash of South-Eastern cultures, it is not uncommon to see thestrals going to pubs with Cajuns and remnant Neighua seeing a film with an inner-city worker.

state_lore_text_container_state_description_14:0 "Located in Luna Bay, Vanhoover contains an excellent natural harbour, and has thus long been a vital port-city. Founded on the ruins of an earlier settlement which had been destroyed by §COlenian Vikings§!, it grew into an important trade port even before industrialisation, being located near the mouth of an important river as well.\n\nAfter the Industrial Revolution, the city grew even more, becoming a vital base of the §YEquestrian Navy§! and a center of shipbuilding. It is the terminus of the transcontinental Equestrian railway and its port is among the largest in the country. Its primary trade good is lumber, imported from Vaverfront across the Luna Bay, but in recent years the service sector has continued to grow. Many movies are filmed here, earning it the nickname "Applewood North", and numerous tourists come there from the south to enjoy the cold weather.\n\nA large portion of the populace consists of Olenian deer, who work on the docks or sell their wares at the markets. There are even some changelings living in the city, though they are viewed with suspicion by the rest of the inhabitants. In recent years the countless dock workers and sailors of the city have unionized and now agitate for better rights. There are rumours that they receive support from the Supreme Soviet of Stalliongrad, but it is not known if this is true.\n\nNote Jotter's Addendum, 1048 Edition: Around the Hegemony in Thirty Days.\n\nVanhoover, capital of the military governance in this region, is one of many cities in this relatively small region surrounding Luna Bay. Across the water lies the deer city of Vaverfront, where materials are shipped in from all across the world to the Hegemony, and to the north is Seaddle, a city straddling the lines between deer, changeling, and pony. Of course, with all this competition, Vanhoover sometimes struggles to keep up with its neighbor cities, but it's managed to, by handling both trains and boats headed all across the Hegemoney.\n\nTrotting through the city, one will see the mix of cultures present, as Olenian wooden buildings mix in with the heavier buildings of ponies, and the dark chitin buildings of Changelings, each species leaving a mark on this city. Indeed, moving through the city itself, this split can be felt, as thousands of changelings flood into the port and train station every day, ready to claim the Equestrian lands for their own purposes and desires. Olenian Deer, along with a few odd Hindians, flow in as well, trying to get free of the busy markets of Vaverfront, towards the calmer markers of Vanhoover.\n\nMost ponies in this town have jobs relating to the moving of cargo, be it loading ships up with cargo, taking cargo off of ships, loading or unloading trains, or providing services such as food to the workers. There used to be a strong labor movement among the dock workers, before and during the Great War, but with the seat of power of Governor-Protector Ocellus laying so close by, now no pony dares to whisper about unions or workers rights. However, every so often, there might be a strike, protest, or small riot, try not to run into any of those.\n\nVanhoover is filled with activities down every street, from the plays put on by pony actors, to music performed by Olenian deer for coins, to the clubs and bars that open up at night. For a night owl, this city is nearly perfect, as long as you stick to the main streets. Changelings, hungry ones, sometimes try to prey upon lone travelers or tourists they see, and the dockyards are filled with potential thieves during the night.\n\nOf note, as well, is the Vanhoover Trade Center, a massive market where fish, meat, and every other good imaginable is sold and bought for fair prices. If paying this city a visit, make sure to stop by the Trade Center. Vanhoover is a wonderful place for the weary traveler, with a lovely night life that doesn't keep one awake when trying to sleep, to a multicultural mix of activities to do, one could spend a week in Vanhoover and still find more to discover."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_15:0 "Although Stableside was never the most influential of the Equestrian metropolises, it carried a friendly charm to it and a small-town feel despite its size. Many once chalked it up to the mixing of different cultures, from the Equestrian settlers who trickled down from the Mild West, the thestral minority with their tenacity and determination, and the Neighua natives that brought a fervor for action and passion for life that others found invigorating. This helped to alleviate many of the tensions that arose during the early part of the eleventh century under Equestria, but it did not stop it forever.\n\nDuring the Great War, Stableside was a naval base for Equestria's Lunar Ocean Fleet after Vanhoover, and later Las Pegasus were lost. By this point in time, the armada was roughly half strength, and it proved to make itself a target for U-boat and ariel attacks, which constrained supplies to the city. However, it was not damaged directly in any conflicts, and only suffered minor devastation. It was also the site of a large military hospital, which was partly staffed by ponies from the Friendship Lodge, a parareligious organization founded in 993 ALB that held Princess Celestia and, to a lesser extent, Princess Twilight Sparkle on high pedestals of friendliness, helpfulness, and care.\n\nHowever, all this friendship and harmony couldn't last, and eventually the burden of reconstructing the country under Daybreaker, and the oppressive taxation she imposed, soured this milk of pony kindness. Stableside was later to revolt against Daybreaker's rule than Baltimare, but it was no less violent. In response to it throwing in its lot with Cobalt Hoof, Daybreaker dispatched Prince Blueblood to handle the rebellion while she focused on BALSOC and its MARESOC support. Blueblood was beaten back repeatedly, as the stallion was far too overconfident and ill-adapted to the terrain to be of use. These victories were spearheaded by Lucky Star and Oxide, who led the militias and few professional soldiers against them and put down Friendship Lodge retaliation at the same time.\n\nLucky Star has since remained in control of Stableside as its Arch-Mayor, somehow cajoling power and influence so that he has crafted a second cult of personality around him, rather than Cobalt Hoof. In light of this, while the city is nominally loyal to Cobalt and COBSOC, there are many indications of the rivalry between the two egos. Currently there resides in front of the gubernatorial palace—a legacy of Daybreaker—a total of sixteen statues of Lucky Star. The first is roughly life-size, and modest in comparison to the smallest of New Baltimare's. However, the horn-measuring contest between Lucky and Cobalt has led to further and more elaborate monuments each time, sometimes with multiple being constructed in response to New Baltimare.\n\nAdditionally, every place of import in the city is named after Lucky in some way. Whether it's the underutilized but still funded Star's Stable Collegiate or the Lucky Lost Maze, everywhere is a reminder of who truly saved Stableside and the South-East from Daybreaker.\n\nWhile the city center is alive with activity and fairly well-maintained, there is little to see beyond the palace, where Lucky rules, and his statues. Where the Friendship Lodge was established near the sea is now nothing more than rubble as he implemented a wave of secularization and banned all religion. Left half-constructed near the main port is what was to be some of the Equus expansions of MARESOC's ministries. Their steel skeletons and crumbling marble exteriors serve as a memorial to the falling out between the two brands of suffocating oppression.\n\nThere is little else to see, as the jungle slowly encroaches on the suburbs, which are resource-starved and dry of funding. Worker ghettos are a frequent sight, and many industrial parks are running on fumes, most likely to collapse into rubble within a decade without maintenance. In the wharf itself are the Third and Fourth Workers' Flotillas, which are used to help guard it from pirates that hide amongst the islands. In the end, while the city is functioning, it is running on borrowed time. Eventually, it will be a true slum, but that could be what Lucky Star wants, so he can cement his power forever."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_16:0 "Once deep within the jungles of the South-East, the ancient city of Tenochtitlan remained a stark reminder of some of the bloodiest portions of the peninsula's history. Founded by Neighua tribe members before the banishment of Luna, its origins remain a mystery to even those ponies descended from its ancient creators. When it was first rediscovered by Equestrian explorers, it was nicknamed the "Lost City," despite never truly having been lost to anypony. It did, however, remain in disrepair for the centuries after Equestria colonized the rest of the peninsula.\n\nNopony can truly answer why the Neighua specifically built the city. Some have speculated it was an ancient empire. Others believe that it was the lead city of a series of city states that lived peacefully with the thestrals, until some event in the distant past spawned the feud that still lasts to this day. Whatever their reasons, the Neighua of the time built a land of expansive canals to provide both transport and drinkable water to the inhabitants, as well as providing nourishment from the Floating Gardens. Centered within the old city is the Pyramid of the Sun, tradition stating it was used for worship of Celestia, although that was discouraged under her rule.\n\nFor much of the city's history after its discovery, it remained languid and stagnant, supported by Princess Celestia as the world advanced, but otherwise untouched, as asked. This changed once the South-East rebelled, and the Neighua rose up against the rebelling workers of the South-East to support their goddess. When Daybreaker retreated in defeat and left the city a smoking wreck, they still cheered for their perceived independence.\n\nFor a few short years, they did indeed have that freedom, until Cobalt Hoof's rise to power, and him turning his full focus onto it as a perfect example of how his rule would rebuild the South-East. Yet the Neighua resisted, as it threatened their autonomy, and he brought the full might of his forces against them. As final retribution for their insolence, Cobalt Hoof attempted to utterly wipe out the identity of the Neighua by torching the entire city. In a few short hours, known to the Neighua as the Infernal Night, everything left in the city was incinerated or leveled by the conquering forces. Hundreds of thousands of Neighua were killed or imprisoned, with the rest being forced to serve as labor for rebuilding their home under a new name: Red Glory.\n\nPicturesque in its brutality, Red Glory stands as the modern ideal of Cobalt Hoof's pony, city, and nation. Faceless towers of concrete and steel greet any traveler who journeys to the once beautiful Tenochtitlan. Corridors and canyons, pony-made and overpowering, cast the downtown in a permanent gloom, no matter the weather. Additionally, the entire city has been redesigned into a tight, grid-like pattern, surrounded by a network of roads that allow for quicker access to elsewhere in the city.\n\nLike all conquerors, Cobalt has done what he can to erase the inhabitants that once lived there. The Neighuan language is suppressed, and their history has been all but erased. Overtop the mount of the Temple of the Sun stands a needle that reaches to the heavens called the Point of Unity. Not only is it a monument, it is reportedly a hidden expansion for COBSOC's Ministry of Truth. The canals that were once clean and safe to drink are now filled with sewage and garbage, which eventually flows back into the river and out into the jungle. The Floating Gardens themselves have long since been killed.\n\nAside from still uncleared rubble from the temple mount and the ancient stadium, there is no trace of what made Tenochtitlan unique. Behind closed doors, the Neighua weep for what has been lost, and more importantly, what will never be regained again."

The fort was built on a river island that was easy to defend from §Ybuffalo raiders§! or §Rmonsters§!. This hoof-shaped island gave the settlement its name as it grew around the fort. Despite its location, it was nevertheless §Rdestroyed§! by a fearsome buffalo raid that used canoes to cross the river. A pony who led the defence and perished, §YFlanchard§!, became the mythical founding hero of Hoofington.\n\nAfter making peace with the natives, the determined settlers rebuilt Hoofington from the ground up as a modern planned city. Mining operations in the eastern §YMacintosh mountains§! and increased trade with the buffalo resulted in rapid growth of the town. Soon enough, money began pouring in from Canterlot and the §YCelestia Dam§! was built, creating the Hoofington reservoir. Investments into education also allowed the opening of many research facilities and schools. With the expanded knowledge base, a source of energy and a steady supply of raw materials, industrial facilities soon opened, and with them came a flood of workers from the north. Within years, Hoofington rivaled §YDodge City§! in size, despite being much younger.\n\nProspectors dug many tunnels around and beneath the city in search of ores. While they didn't find any, there are plans to use the tunnels for metro stations, as the rapidly growing city could greatly benefit from new methods of transportation. What the miners did find was a §glarge and ancient meteorite§! that had magical properties. It has been studied for many years now, and researchers hope that it could one day be used as a source of energy. In the meantime, a second hydroelectric dam was recently built, and it was named the §3Luna Dam§!, to honour the reformed Princess of the Night.\n\nWhile the §Y"Spirit of the Mild West"§! is almost nonexistent in Hoofington, it has nevertheless established itself as one of the greatest cities of the Equestrian south. It is a testament to the diligence of ponykind and a shining example of what ponies can accomplish in mere decades by working together.\n\nNote Jotter's Addendum, 1048 Edition: Around the Hegemony in Thirty Days.\n\nHoofington is the furthest city from the imperial core of the Hegemony, and here, so far from Vesalipolis, ponies live the lives they wish to with little interference from the north. Changelings are few and far between, except for a few brave businessbugs who've come to stake their claim in the largest city of the Appleloosan Protectorate. Home to two of the largest dams in the world, and a secret meteorite underground, this city is a lively one to visit.\n\nAll around, Equestrian architecture rules the city, as tall buildings of steel and glass grace the skyline with their presence. Trams and trollies, powered by an excess of hydropower generated electricity, zip to and fro, up and down bustling streets where the good ponies of the city work. Factories produce material for all the southwest to enjoy, businesses run their HQs, accountants tick away the day in the concrete jungle. Down on the street level, there's no drone of cars like elsewhere in the Hegemony, as these ponies have rejected cars from butting in on their trotable city. There's no better place for a pony to trot through than here.\n\nOutside of Hoofington rest two massive dams, the Chrysalis Dam, which used to be called the Luna Dam, and the Hoofer Dam, which used to be called the Celestia Dam. Visiting these dams is a wonderful experience for anyone interested in architecture, as both have museums dedicated to their construction, their important use during the war, and much more, including a small film with real footage from the construction of these dams. These dams provide power to the entire south-west, allowing them to export their massive amounts of oil to elsewhere in the Hegemony.\n\nOf note as well is the Hoofington Observatory, a large astronomical museum, complete with a star-room and an observatory, built due to an ancient meteorite found under the city decades ago. Here, tourists can look into the stars, and listen to ponies with the word star in their name go on and on about the beauty that's above the planet. In this world, it's so easy to make small problems seem so much larger than they are, but when you gaze into the endless void of space, and see all the twinkling stars in the distance, well, there's nothing else on your mind than just how small we all are.\n\nHoofington is a great place to start or end a trip, enjoying the heat in the winter as you explore the dams and all the city has to offer. A small word of warning, though, to the east is the land of the South-Eastern Governorate and COBSOC. While they aren't technically MARESOC, Cobalt Hoof encompasses many of the Party's worst traits in a single pony. If you veer too far to the east, you may end up unponied and be shipped off to one of the prisons in the Dragon Isles."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_21:0 "Appleloosa is a young town, having been built within a year in 999 ALB. Established by Equestrian settlers, it is surrounded by apple orchards which are used to produce the town's primary export, famed apple pies. Unsurprisingly, many inhabitants of the town are part of the vast Apple family. It is governed by §YSheriff Silverstar§! who maintains law and order. The town has a saloon known as the Salt Block, a clock tower and a stage for musical performances. It is known for its horse-drawn horse-drawn carriages and local mild west dances.\n\nIn 1001 ALB, Appleloosa was at the epicenter of the short but violent conflict known as the §RApple War§!. It erupted after nearby buffalo tribes demanded the ponies to tear down their orchards, for they had been planted on their traditional stampeding grounds. The ponies refused to destroy their livelihoods and the buffalo attacked. Compromise was only reached when Chief Thunderhooves was downed by an apple pie, which he found to be delicious. Soon a historic agreement was signed: The ponies get to keep their orchards, as long as they gift apple pies to the buffalo. Ever since, peace has prevailed between the two races, but time will tell if it lasts.Note Jotter's Addendum, 1048 Edition: Around the Hegemony in Thirty Days.\n\nAppleloosa is a small city between the larger cities of Hoofington and Rockville, and is one fraught with many issues. The focal point of a revolt against Queen Chrysalis' reign not too long ago, Appleloosa is a town of proud Equestrian nationalists. Trotting around the streets, a tourist will see ponies in dusters, vests, and overly large hats, as Appleloosa is home to the distinctive south-western fashion culture of Equestria, one will also see a lot of old wooden buildings, reminders of this city's past as a frontier town.\n\nThe main attraction of Appleloosa is not the city itself, but those who inhabit part of it, the Buffalo. Once a proud, independent tribe, the Buffalo were annexed and made part of the Appleloosan Protectorate, but the cultural heritage and pride of the Buffalo can still be seen. I'd personally recommend trying to grab a drink in the Buffalo district of the city, share a drink and try some unique Buffalo cuisine, such as fry bread, and learn the proud, long history of this often forgotten culture. Once you're done, ask around the ponies too; in a once frontier town like this, every family has some gossip and memories to share about the past.\n\nAppleloosa is also famously home to a large apple orchard at least partly planted by a relative of the Element of Honesty, Applejack. The desert heat and arid climate give the fruits of this city a distinctive sweet juiciness, and this city is famous for baked goods mixing together the different apple cultivars' flavors. Ask around for the best apple pies in town and try them all for yourself, you might get a stomachache, but you won't regret it.\n\nHowever, just because this city is part of the Hegemony, don't fool yourself into thinking they're fans of Chrysalis. These ponies and Buffalo are hospitable, but if you go around talking about your political opinions, they'll be quick to toss you out onto your flank. Just smile and nod if you're a changeling loyalist, it's best to not bring up politics at all.\n\nOverall Appleloosa is well worth a small visit, but I wouldn't recommend staying for too long, as the city lacks a lot of places to visit. Take a train, or a car, from Hoofington and arrive around noon, enjoy some baked goods and some good conversation, before heading out to Rockville.

However, it wasn't always so blasé, as the original settlement upon which Dodge City—also known as Dodge Junction—was constructed was a fort upon the perimeter of former buffalo lands to guard settlers as they moved further into the desert, which were so underdeveloped and unpopulated that it remained uncontested by the buffalo for a couple of generations.\n\nLike all vital locations, where there were ponies, there was a need to house them, and the first homes and inns to hold traders, travelers, and entrepreneurs were built across the river from Fort Dodge. This increase in population further cemented the fort's importance to the region, and in time a railway connection was constructed, with the newly-christened Dodge City as its primary junction for the region. With yet another way for ponies to come and settle in the burgeoning city, its population skyrocketed, going from a few thousand ponies to close to one hundred thousand within only a decade, and ponies continued to flock to the city in two more waves, one when the soil to the north was discovered to be perfect for growing cherry trees and other sensitive horticulture, and a second when oil was discovered further into the Mild West.\n\nBy the time of the Great War, the city was nearing one million strong and it was a hub of industry and tourism. Much of the luster of the frontier had been stripped away as some of the descendants of the original settlers moved on and the city became more bent to pleasing tourists and corporations alike. During the Great War itself, Dodge City proved itself a vital manufacturer of guns and foodstuffs for the Equestrian military.\n\nHowever, when Chrysalis's armies approached, the industry began to suffer. While it never was occupied, many of the small towns that provided workers were captured by the changelings, and it slipped into an economic slump after Celestia and Chrysalis agreed to a ceasefire. For a short time, this was reversed after the Solar Empire was proclaimed, and Daybreaker drew upon every manufactory to defend the land against the invasion of Stalliongrad and later the traitors in the South-East.\n\nYet that temporary boon soon dried up, as the war with the South-East stretched on and resources began to be strained. One by one, the war factories were shuttered as they suffered logistics constraints and a growing taxation burden that Daybreaker was using to fund her war and keep the larger companies in Fillydelphia and Manehattan afloat. By the time of her defeat in the South-East, roughly a quarter of the city's industry had been lost. When the Canterlot aristocracy seceded and declared a rival government in New Canterlot, the mayor of Dodge City threw her lot in with them. The alleviated taxes did help, but it didn't stem the flow of economic migrants who moved to both the capital of the Principality of Central Equestria and other cities that had aligned themselves with it.\n\nToday, many streets in the city have decayed from lack of funding. Entire industrial parks lay abandoned and crumbling, a sign of the might of the former premier Mild West town. The agriculture industry is still thriving, with Cherry Hill Ranch expanding into a conglomerate of different crops. A small tourism industry likewise still exists. Additionally, on the eve of the Forever Sun Celebration in the Solar Empire, Dodge City hosts a midnight vigil for the Princess that everypony lost, and everypony wishes would return.\n\nDespite the economic downturns and bleak outlook, the core of the frontier spirit has endured. Ponies remain optimistic about the future. That alone is something that many in the Principality could use a lesson in."

From its earliest days, it traced its founding back to the first Moonspeaker, Mare Nostrum, and his companion, an Ursa Major by the name of Sails Through Stars. Legends and Moonspeaker mythos speak of some of their exploits aiding the creator of the Moon itself and the unrest that she went through in later years. Yet her name has been lost to the eons of time, perhaps even in the first known records of the Moonspeakers.\n\nThroughout the ages, Ayacachtli has remained a haven for thestrals, and has indeed remained entirely dominated by them. Before the Great War, census estimates placed it within the ninety-five percent range, with non-thestrals occupying recent suburbs far outside the mountain cliffs that holds the majority of the city. Inside the peak, south of the Badlands, the massive cavern that has been carved out by successive generations lends an aura of awe and splendor to Ayacachtli, which ignores the decades, if not centuries of slow decline.\n\nWhile the city has endured numerous crises, ranging from a copper quality problem organized by a cabal of merchants a few hundred years prior to Luna's banishment, to atrophy from slowing trade from the 300s ALB onward, to race and ethnic tensions that peaked in the late 900s, Ayacachtli has never quite returned to its original grandeur. Before the Great War, the schism between thestrals and the other pony tribes was finally on the mend, with no small effort thanks to Princesses Celestia and Luna. In response, Ayacachtli, which had almost been exclusively thestral before then, opened its doors to skilled tradesponies and workers, who settled in the suburbs of Eestlia and the Theems. When the Great War began, the mining tunnels that had remained in operation for centuries were tapped for resources for the Equestrian war machine, providing another economic boom to the region.\n\nFor the first time in over a century, the great Temple of the Moon received an extensive repair and restoration. The Lunar Tabula was freshly painted, so that tourists could see the beauty of the night that the Moonspeakers had known for so long. Many of the towers upon which the city expanded were reinforced, spread outward, and expanded into the stone walls of the cave itself. In a few short years, the decline of so many centuries appeared to be reversed, but its fortunes didn't last.\n\nWhen the South-East seceded from the Solar Empire after the wars with the changelings and Stalliongrad, the Moonspeaker council remained neutral in the matter. But they were not allowed to remain aloof. Disagreements within the thestral warrior bands ultimately led to an attack on the temple, which damaged some of the outward facade. While the thestrals ultimately supported Cobalt Hoof, his reward to them was the "stability" his government provided. Although they had some autonomy, there was now a permanent COBSOC presence within the city.\n\nSince the South-East seceded, the city has seen its share of violence. Protests by conscientious thestrals were crushed brutally, which has left some of the stone towers inside the cavern empty and desolate. An uprising in the thestral militia led to the loss of thousands of lives, and further deteriorated some of the great landmarks of the thestrals. The monument to Mare Nostrum was irreparably defaced, and the Gilded Half Moon, a beautiful garden past the Temple of the Moon filled with iridescent plants and lichens was burned to a husk.\n\nAyacachtli has endured, however, but remains a low priority in the South-East's plan. The Moonspeakers are allowed to continue leading the city by COBSOC in exchange for loyalty in necessary matters. Despite still wowing many visitors, in the city there hangs an air of decay and fear. Yet there are still events to see. On the equinoxes, the Moonspeakers host grand ceremonies to celebrate the moon and sun in balance, and during the winter solstice, a nightly vigil is held with artists painting the night sky or their patron alicorn, Princess Luna. On every seventh of the month, the city is lit with lanterns to commemorate all who were taken in the protests against COBSOC, and the great thestral city almost looks like it were lit in daylight.\n\nAlthough Ayacachtli's glory days seem to remain behind it, the city retains a strong culture and endurance not seen by most ponies. It will last, just like it always has, one crisis at a time."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_38:0 "Surrounded by countless §Yrock farms§! and nestled among hills, Rockville is a center of mining industry and mineral processing. Its name derives from tonnes of rock regularly brought into the city from the farms for refinement. It was an insignificant village before the §Ygemstone rush§! of 931 ALB which attracted countless migrants.\n\nRockville is a city of foundries, steel mills and mines. The landscape around the city is barren and the air in the settlement itself is difficult to breathe. Yet it is also a prospering town, producing a large amount of gold, coal, sulfur, tin, copper, platinum, gemstones and more.\n\nIts inhabitants are grim-faced, their faces often covered in soot, but hard-working and relentless. Some call it the least friendly place in Equestria, but those outsides who have earned the trust of a Rockville pony know that they are the most trusty and reliable companies one may have. The Element of Laughter, §YPinkamena Pie§! (more commonly known as Pinkie Pie) breaks the stereotype by being one of the cheeriest ponies in the country, despite coming from a hardy family of rock farmers.\n\nNote Jotter's Addendum, 1048 Edition: Around the Hegemony in Thirty Days.\n\nAh, Rockville, otherwise known as the Duchy of Duke Rockfeller, because even if he has no title and no technical ownership of this city, everyone knows it is his. Rockville is famous for its proximity to the rock farms, an odd southern Equestrian tradition where ponies would farm rocks for colorful gems. For a long time, this settlement was where the rock farmers would come and sell the gems they got, and where land disputes and the like would be fought and decided between. Then, along came oil barons, including the current head of the city, Rockfeller. They began to dig under the soil, until they struck black gold, and with that oil came civilization, industry, and the makings of a new city.\n\nRockville is a smaller city, much more cozy than many others, but one wouldn't know that by looking at its citizens. Stoic and stone-faced, most ponies in this city work hard manual labor, with shifts made much longer by the demands of Rockfeller. Drillers work around the clock, as do miners excavating everything they can, to feed the growing hunger of the Hegemony. However, in this hard work and near poverty, there has been a great culture developing. The ponies of this city, left without many luxuries, are known as culinary innovators, using what limited food they can find in ways that are unthought of and delicious. All across the Hegemony are chefs and cooks whose recipes found willing customers, and who quickly left their home to chase a better life.\n\nRockville is also quite famous for its local university, famous for giving out Rocktorates to brilliant students, teaching geology and geography to any student who's willing to learn and apply what they learn. The university also operates a local museum of geology, a place where foals can go and learn about the different types of rocks and how they come to be. Yes, it's more interesting than it sounds, it's actually quite fascinating and has many interactive experiences.\n\nOverall Rockville isn't a bad stop on a trip around the Hegemony, with good food, a good museum, and mostly good ponies, it's a great place to stay a day or two."

Founded by Twilight's student, §CStarlight Glimmer§!, well before she was shown the error of her ways, Our Town was a beacon of a new and exciting opportunity for ponykind. §REqualism§! was masterminded by Starlight, who convinced the Supreme Soviet of Stalliongrad to provide her a small plot of land to begin her experiment.\n\nEverypony would have been equal, with no unique special talent, no qualms between neighbors, and everypony assisting to the best of their ability for the betterment of the community. It would not last, as Starlight was §Rexposed§! to have centralized power around herself, keeping her cutie mark and controlling the populace with a strong, magically-powered hoof.\n\nIn the aftermath, Our Town dropped its name, although it struggled to devise a new one. One of Starlight's oldest followers, §YDouble Diamond§!, was elected as the town's new leader, and he immediately went to work reforming the hamlet. His incentives of specialization rapidly improved the state of the settlement, and some industry began to move into the rapidly growing town.\n\nRemaining steadfastly autonomous from Stalliongrad, Our Town became a stark reminder to the new General Secretary, §RSinister Serov§!, of the mistake the Soviet made trusting Starlight. While Double Diamond continued to desire cordial but distant relationships with Stalliongrad, Sinister provided one \"viable\" option for the future: annexation.\n\nAfter he convinced Double Diamond through a few well-timed military exercises near the township, Sinister immediately set to work establishing that his brand of communism was correct and superior. All remaining references in the town to Starlight – the tree planted in her former home plot, the cave which she stored the ripped cutie marks, the one or two small statues of respect for her redemption – were removed, covered up, or defaced. The new inner city, the remnants of Our Town, were left to neglect and ruin.\n\nSurrounding the older buildings are chic, modern, and imposing structures that stretch to the skies. Constructed of marble, polished granite, and other lustrous stones, the skyscrapers, apartment blocks, and even factories stare down at the pitiful and decaying thatched roofs of the downtown core. Any mention of Equalism or Starlight is §Osuppressed§!, and large monuments to Sinister, the true savior of the proletariat, have been constructed at the entrances to the city.\n\nBut against the communist mantra, there is still inequality in the settlement. The inner populace lives in near destitution, and the few remaining residents of Our Town from Starlight's day reside on the streets. Although the face of §YSerovgrad§! paints a rosy picture, the heart is rotted and decayed. Unrest is a constant threat as the idealistic beliefs of Equalism are shattered, day after day."

If you're lucky, you might arrive during the Harvest Festival, where ponies from all around the region will come, bringing free food, for anyone lucky enough to enjoy. It's a day and night filled with fun festival games, happy ponies, and changelings eager to drain any love they can from any pony they can.\n\nBefore you leave, make sure to check out the Museum of Agriculture near the center of town, it's a fun time for all ages, and the curator of the museum is very friendly and welcoming to any tourists, they even offer some famous Tall Tale bread to visitors, for free, using different preparation techniques invented over time, a real taste of history.

Additionally, the citizens have begun new traditions to keep themselves occupied.

Crime is not an uncommon sight, especially from soldiers and sailors when they are on leave.

Despite it being a floating cloud-city, even earth ponies and unicorns can walk on it thanks to more modern magical engineering, with long platforms of metal and concrete functioning as walkable streets. The service-orientated economy is thriving, and though there is a lack of farmland to sustain the city, food has always been imported from elsewhere in Equestria. There's something for everyone here, from newborns and young partiers to elders looking for something new and exciting.\n\nUnder this shining cloud-city however is the second half of Las Pegasus. Here, large companies such as Horseco and Rockville Oil dominate, their factories cluttering the cityscape. Gigantic steel foundries churn out endless tonnes of stainless steel, which is used by the huge shipyards in the construction of new luxury cruise ships and military vessels. Surrounding this industrial heart are the apartments of the common workers, who toil in service of large companies. It is fertile ground for leftist movements, some more radical than others, and the ponies of the cloud-city above demand the police to ensure that Stalliongradian influence does not spread. So far, they have only been moderately successful, but as long as Equestria remains stable the proletariat are unlikely to cause trouble.\n\nNote Jotter's Addendum, 1048 Edition: Around the Hegemony in Thirty Days.\n\nLas Pegasus, the shining beacon of the south, never has there been such a hive of scum, villainy, and fun.

state_lore_text_container_state_description_67:0 "Trottingham, located on a small peninsula in the §YGriffish Isles§!, is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Equestria. When the three tribes first migrated south, some of the seafaring ponies decided to settle on uninhabited islands east of the lands which later became known as §CSeveryana§!. It is not known when exactly the city was founded, but the earliest records come from centuries before Luna's Banishment.\n\nThe settlement quickly became an important center of trade when overseas routes to §OGriffonia§! were established, which gave the islands their name. This importance further increased when the port of §YPetershoof§! was founded in 590 ALB. Trottingham's harbour was greatly expanded and thousands of migrants arrived from both Severyana and Griffonia, diversifying the population. During the §YIndustrial Revolution§!, textile manufactories were founded, lace became one of the primary exports and the town grew into a true city.\n\nThe inhabitants of the Griffish Isles still speak a dialect that derives from §YOld Ponish§!, which is one of the more distinct accents of Equestria. This means that ponies coming from the Griffish Isles can easily be recognized for their archaic way of speaking. The age of the venerable city can also be seen in its architecture, with its buildings having various styles from different periods and cultures. The most famous sights are the historical Lace Market, the Council House, the Great Harbour, the remains of the city's stone walls and the nearby Trottingham Castle. Many who visit the historical center of the city say that it almost feels like travelling back in time. However, this illusion fades away the further away you go, as the outskirts of the city are more recently constructed and far more modern.\n\nMore recently, the Trottingham's history has taken a darker turn. With the §RWinter Revolution§! in Severyana, one of the most important trade partners was lost, causing an economic downturn and making the city more reliant on aid from Canterlot. This in turn has led to unrest among the workers, partially thanks to communist agitation. In addition, the breakup of the §OGriffonian Empire§! caused an influx of griffon migrants and refugees, which have caused increased racial tensions. The city's future is now uncertain, but nopony doubts that the ancient city will continue to stand the test of time.\n\nNote Jotter's Addendum, 1048 Edition: Inside Sinister Serov's Steel Shield.\n\nTrottingham, in 1007, was a city on the boiling point, being disconnected from Canterlot and relying only on trade flowing into its port. The port workers, overworked and underpaid, quickly fostered communist sympathies amongst the population, especially as Stalliongrad sent in infiltrators by the day. These sympathies amongst the port workers led to an intentional slowing down of trade into the city, paired with strikes and worker demonstrations. Thus, when the Great War came, and Equestria started to forcibly conscript ponies from this island, those strikes became protests, and those protests became riots. Military police responded harshly and violently to any form of dissent from the isle and the city.\n\nStatues in the city properly venerate the turning point of Trottingham's modern history, when the local military police seized the leader of the Trottingham labour movement, Whirlpool Slice, and executed him in front of the protesting ponies. Just a few days later, Stalliongrad would begin their war against Equestria, then the Solar Empire, of course. The Stalliongrad army marched onto the isle expecting fierce resistance, but what they found instead was a city filled with a mix of dead protestors, innocent bystanders, and dead Solar troops, who garrisoned the city. The locals of Trottingham had enough, and attacked the soldiers, many of them being gunned down in the battle. But they won in the end, and the few that remained in the aftermath happily joined Stalliongrad.\n\nAs the war against the Solar Empire ended, this isle, found relatively depopulated from both revolt and war, would find a new purpose. Sinister Serov would gladly take all of the loyal revolutionaries of Trottingham, moving them into key locations, guarding the coasts, while he moved in new ponies. Political prisoners, prisoners of war, and traitors to the revolution would stream into the isle, forced to work along the coastline under the careful watch of the many Trottingham revolutionaries. There, they produce new ships for Stalliongrad, working off their crimes and their sins, in the eyes of Sinister."

Day in and day out, boats from Las Pegasus, Appleloosa, Vanhoover, and trading partners across Zebrica and Griffonia come to buy and sell their wares. Most prevalent in this port are artifacts of Zebrican origin, Abyssinian coffee, Chiropterran automobiles, honey and wood from Karkadannistan, and oil from the Pranshidun. Every power in Zebrica trades away their natural and cultural resources, all for the hope of getting some Changeling tanks, mercenaries, or guns, with which they can try to secure greatness equal to even half of what the changelings have done.\n\nDespite the city having a relatively small population, compared to the other major cities of Changelingia, the creatures who call this city home come from all paths of life. Sailors speaking in exotic tongues roam between the bars, vendors line the streets selling foreign delicacies like cous-cous and baklava, and young, hip changelings and deer call this diverse city their home. Vaverfront is a place where foreign cultures clash and new ideas rise, all while keeping the coziness and friendliness expected with a smaller city.\n\nAlso popular in Vaverfront are its beach resorts, being one of the only ports in Changelingia that don't freeze for half of the year, the coast all the way from Vaverfront to Svenholm and Seaddle are covered by beach resorts. Pop in for a visit, get a massage from the best Griffon masseuses, go kayaking with a Minotaur instructor, or just go for a swim. And, for the more adventurous among us, Vaverfront is a great place to stay for those who wish to ski the Lumivuoret Mountains, as it's only a short drive over. Of course, like every city in Changelingia, make sure to bring a warm coat.\n\nI rate Vaverfront a 9/10 for trotability, the city has many options for public transportation that sometimes slow down a trot, but otherwise everything is very close to each other. I rate Vaverfront a 10/10 for flyability, the skies are mostly clear above this city, except for a few flyers who have somewhere to be. I rate Vaverfront for museums and activities a 10/10, there's always some new cultural experience just right around the corner.

At one point the melting pot of Equestria, much of the city and its surrounding boroughs have had their immigrant populations dispersed: a far cry from the tolerant policies of the Equestrian diarchy.\n\nTraveling along the narrow streets of the inner city reveal the damage of the years. The ornate skyscrapers have been §Oabandoned§! or torn down to be replaced with towering, skeletal apartment complexes to house the untold millions of workers that feed Manehattan's ravenous military industry. Of the arts that once flourished in the city, only a few stray statues remain of the beautiful marble that filled the sky.\n\nWhile it was not a direct victim of §CChrysalis's war§! with Equestria, Manehattan was occupied for a short while by §RSinister Serov's§! forces. In the time they had, they begun dismantling the worst excesses of capitalism from Manehattan, stripping some of the monuments bare, and leaving a husk of Mane Street behind. In the ensuing liberation by §ODaybreaker§!, the city received further damage, which was repaired in the following years, although never achieving the splendor of its Pre-War self.\n\nSalvation Plaza stands where Mane Square used to reside. As an enormous monument to Daybreaker, it is the centerpiece of the city and harkens to all to give her the due reverence she deserves for their protection and deliverance. But it was not always the case; Manehattan's §Yunions§! – an idiosyncrasy tolerated by the Empress – used the area once as a staging ground for mass strikes to protest the harsh conditions of the Empire's factories.\n\nWhen it was suppressed, Daybreaker appointed the creation of a chapter house for the §OSolaris Inquisitionis§!, which instituted the creation of the Ordos of the Empire. Manehattan is the seat of §YOrdo Multi§!, the most populous of the religious regions, and filled with the most contention. For in the smokestacks of the factories and the burning furnaces of the steel smelters, rumbles of sedition and unrest have begun to grow.\n\n§RRebellion§! has taken root. The former student of Twilight Sparkle, §YStarlight Glimmer§! and her friend §YTrixie Lulamoon§! have entrenched themselves somewhere in the city or countryside. Forever a menace to the stability of the Empire, they have been a thorn in the Empress's side for years. With growing union strife threatening to boil over into another strike and potentially an armed uprising, it is only a matter of time to see what the old melting pot of Equestria will provide."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_76:0 "In §YJelzek's Memory§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_76:0 "Hjortland is the proud capital of Olenia. The place where the gods of the land are honoured and where the bravest warriors and explorers charted the oceans from. Many sagas begin or end here and many a tall tale too! It is the cultural heart of the Olenians and even an object of imagination and fantasy for those deer whose ancestors departed from her shores long ago.\n\nOccupying the easternmost stretch of a large peninsula, Hjortland's location is highly defensible while occupying a central location among the ever important Olenian south coast. As the seat of the House of Jelzek, Hjortland is the natural capital of the country. The Kings of Olenia occupy the Palace in Hjortland, built with a mix of Equestrian and Olenian styles, giving the building an appearance of modernity while not totally abandoning the Olenian woodworking traditions. The palace is only one of the traditional centres of Olenian politics, however, but the fate of the other hangs in the balance still. The Riksdag, also known as the Eduskunta, used to be the Olenian parliament. However, with the rise of King Johan, the Riksdag has been suspended for the time being, leaving the building a slowly rotting carcass, which some would whisper is representative of the country after the Kings unorthodox ascension.\n\nNote Jotter's Addendum, 1048 Edition: Around the Hegemony in Thirty Days.\n\nOnce, Hjortland was the grand capital of Olenia, where the Kings and Queens of the unified realm would sit and dictate their peaceful realm. Now, though, after the Changeling conquest, Hjortland has become a shadow of Vesalipolis, undergoing a transformation into a strong changeling-styled culture. Where once streets had traditional Olenian wooden structures, along with modern Equestrian style, now they are shouldered out by grand spires and tight streets of chitin, as collaborators eagerly consume the culture of their overlords, and rich changelings move in day by day, to enjoy the lower taxes of Olenia\n\nThe city itself is split into three main sections, the old Olenian section, the Equestrian section, and the modern Changeling section. In the Olenian section of the city, important government buildings of historical importance, such as the Riksdag, the former parliament of Olenia, have been turned into museums for tourists to explore. Similarly, the old Royal Palace has been converted into the Changelingia Museum of Opulence, where bugs from all across the Hegemony can come to look upon the opulent gems and gold of Olenian royalty. The museum itself carries a strong sensation of disgust, as the old Olenian royals are routinely depicted as greedy, soft, and corrupt rulers, in an attempt to make the Olenians ashamed of their past and instead embrace the simplistic culture of the changelings.\n\nIn the Equestrian quarter are most of the factories of the city, many of which still produce weapons that are immediately shipped away to Changelingia. Many historical buildings here have been destroyed or replaced with changeling style buildings, leaving behind only hints of the Hoofsiatc League, a group of Equestrian merchants who operated their businesses in this district long ago. What remains of the Hoofsa have been turned into tacky museums to take nymphs and fawns to, museums about the greed of the Equestrian merchant class. Paintings and engravings all around these museums laugh at the idea of Equestrian Harmony, showing the ancient pony merchants as shifty liars, using a facade of kindness to cheat the Olenians out of their goods.\n\nThe Changeling quarter is where most new construction is done, where large apartment buildings and suburban style houses, all complete with cars imported from Changelingia, are built in changeling style. Dark chitin houses line streets named after old Queens of hives, and beachfronts line the shore, inviting changelings to shape-shift into Seaponies and take a swim.\n\nHjortland is a pleasant visit, if only for the museums and the unique mixture of deer and changeling culture the city provides. However, if one is looking for Olenia, you won't be finding it here anymore. Hjortland is good for a quick visit on a cruise, otherwise it is not truly worth going to.

state_lore_text_container_state_description_122:0 "Nestled in a large valley in the middle of the §YStar Forest§!, medieval spires, castles, and large windmills poke above the trees. §YNew Canterlot§!, originally the settlement of Peaceful Rest, is the capital of the Princessdom of Central Equestria. The nation was born out of the fires of §Rwar§!, when the conservative and harmonious ponies of the central plains of Equestria banded together to throw off their Imperial overlords. In a signal to all ponies who wished to remain free, they decided to christen the city after the ancient capital of their homeland, in the hope that it would give legitimacy to their successor state claim.\n\nMany of the inhabitants are migrants from other areas of the Princessdom, or even refugees that escaped the Solar Empire's oppression of those it deemed heretics. Some survivors of the §RGreat War§! also lay claim to their home in the rustic town, providing their skilled labor to keep the economy functioning.\n\nNew Canterlot is not a modern city by any stretch of the imagination. If a pony were to step into New Canterlot, they would believe they had utilized a time travel spell, as most of the roads are muddy ruts, with the occasional gravel boulevard. To mimic the old Canterlot, new buildings are constructed in a similar, antique colonial style. Giant stone castles help to guard the city, and marble arches and sweeping, grand theatres and churches add additional flair to the skyline.\n\nIn the middle of the valley, another castle much like Celestia's old palace in Canterlot itself stretches to the skies on a giant, artificial mountain. Housing the regency council, many of its halls remain empty and unused, waiting for a proper pony to fill its throne. In the council room, statues of the great Wielders of the §YElements§! stand as silent sentinels to ensure the proper decisions are made.\n\nElsewhere in New Canterlot there are smiths, spinsters, bakers, and other cottage industry specialists, hearkening yet further to the sensation of entering a time capsule. Many ponies down on their luck wander the streets, although everypony is more than willing to help another out. Few guards are required, as the citizenry channels the harmony that kept Equestria alive for more than a thousand years.\n\nAlthough it is a struggling city with many problems, the ponies and the council of New Canterlot keep the end result in focus: The light of Harmony must still burn, for ponies can always do §Gbetter§!."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_153:0 "The §YOld Age Home§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_153:0 "Originally Stalliongrad was known as §YPrincessyn§!, the capital of the northeastern Severyana region. It had been a relatively small town before the Industrial Revolution, when the abundant natural resources of the region allowed it to grow massively. Within centuries, it was one of the largest cities in Equestria, a thriving center of industry always covered in thick smog, especially during cold winters.\n\nYet the growth of the city had a dark side. Its workers were mistreated and discontent grew. Due to its distance from the capital, Princess Celestia remained unaware of the tension before it was too late. The workers revolted, inspired by the writings of Caramel Marks and led by §RSteel Stallion§!, and seceded from Equestria in the Winter Revolution.\n\nAfter Steel Stallion died from illness, the Supreme Soviet renamed Princessyn in his memory to §RStalliongrad§!, which remains the city's name to this day. Nowadays Stalliongrad is a proletarian city, with any remains of capitalism erased. Gone are the houses of the merchants, the markets and the shops, the colourful adverts and the luxurious cars. It is now exclusively the city of smokestacks, factories, apartment blocks, machines, cogs, smoke and steel. In the center stands the imposing Palace of the Soviets, a grand project that has been years in the making, a testament to the industriousness and ambition of the Stalliongradian proletariat.\n\nNote Jotter's Addendum, 1048 Edition: Inside Sinister Serov's Steel Shield.\n\nAh, Stalliongrad, home of the revolution, and home to one of the largest empires in history, at least in terms of industry and population. The Palace of the Soviets looms in the city's skyline, overlooking miles upon miles of grey apartments, housing all the needy and desperate. Ponies line up for food imported from Albion, plentiful grain ensuring that no pony goes hungry, even if they might not all be full. Statues line the streets, as do Soviet representatives, eager to spread the revolutionary truth, while up in his office on high, Sinister Sevrov watches. Though none would say it loudly, you can hear it whispered through the streets, that his mind has started to slip.\n\nFactories churn out guns, ammunition, and artillery by the thousands in Stalliongrad, to be shipped all around the world in the name of liberation. Loyal party members control these factories, demanding harsh conditions, with the Ponies' Police around to ensure any compliance, for those who might disobey. Foals report every day to the Pioneers, where they learn how to become soldiers for the revolution, be it through firing a gun, or working in a factory. Despite the rather grim sound of things, though, the most remarkable thing about this city is that the creatures here are happy. Griffons, Crystal Ponies, and regular ponies trot side by side, telling jokes and relaxing after hard days of work, foals learn advanced mathematics and sciences, and the disabled veterans of the great wars tell tales to the youth, the horror and glories of war.\n\nStalliongrad is the center of an empire, and this can be seen, as it is one of the best, if not the best, places to live in the world. As long as you don't break the laws, or speak in a dissident manner, you will have a home, an education, and enough food, you have a life, no matter your species. The changelings, for all their empire, still are content to let the common bug suffer, or to ignore the deer, bears, and ponies, but here, all are treated the same, except those who work for the party proper, who get privileges. Despite all the downsides of the system, one must imagine a Stalliongrader happy."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_166:0 "Throughout its history, the port of Petershoof has been Severyana's gateway to the world, and occasionally functioned as its capital. Named after the mythical ruler of pre-Equestrian Severyana, §YTsar Peter§!, it is a major shipping port and shipyard, and a center of commerce. From this strategically important warm-water port, the resources and goods produced inland are shipped abroad.\n\nDespite two revolutions, the Industrial revolution and the Winter revolution, the city retains its classical look especially in its historic city center, with most buildings made out of brick and stone. Countless monuments dot the city, the most notable one being the §YBronze Horse§!, a statue depicting Tsar Peter himself. On the outskirts of the city are more modern apartment blocks and industrial factories.\n\nAlongside Princessyn, now known as §RStalliongrad§!, Petershoof was another major center of resistance which sparked the Winter Revolution. The sailors in the city's naval base mutinied and revolted against the Princess' rule and seized control of the city with the help of factory workers, joining the newly formed §RSoviet Republic§! afterwards. There have been talks of demolishing the "monarchist" monuments of the city, but their cultural and historical value have so far been deemed too significant.\n\nNote Jotter's Addendum, 1048 Edition: Inside The Shield of Steel.\n\nDespite all the changes this city has seen over the years, this city still remains as the second capital of Stalliongrad, and its port to the world. Day by day, food is shipped in from distant lands, while guns and bullets leave this shining port, destined for the hooves of far distant rebels. The streets are filled with trolley cars and trams, pulling workers from one place to another, eternally fueling the beating heart of industry, which rules in this city. Traders operating in this city should take note of its new name, Altidiyagrad, as it is frowned upon to call the city by its old name, Petershoof.\n\nOnce, the center of this city was dominated by reminders of the past, thick brick buildings and monuments, but now these same buildings and monuments have been repurposed, if not destroyed. A statue of Tsar Peter, the Bronze Horse statue of fame, has been changed to Steel Stallion, gazing to the south with revolutionary fire in his eyes. On every street corner are proud party members, bringing children from all around the country to the Museum of Capitalistic Corruption, a museum built out of an old town hall, dedicated to the eccentricities of the old capitalist leaders. In the center of the town, an old market square has been converted to a university, the Institute Of Sociology and Philosophy, where young students flock, seeking an education that will allow them into the upper halls of power as a member of the party's leadership.\n\nThrough the city is a revolutionary fervor felt like nowhere else in the world, except Free Albion and Stalliongrad. I was disguised as a trader from the Marechester Communes when I visited, and I was treated as both a fellow revolutionary, yet, oddly, like an idiotic foal. Loyal party members, eyes brimming with the fire of the Winter Revolution, would speak of the Great Patriotic War against Equestria, how one day Stalliongraders and Marechesterites will march side by side through Canterlot, all the way to Vanhoover and Acornage. Yet they would chide me for my 'home' and how their system of communism was broken, flawed, how I should become a true Stallionist like Sinister. They would offer me to come over for tea and vodka, to share a drink and discuss theory. Fortunately, I am well-read enough on Marksism that I was able to avoid any suspicion of my origins. If they treated a fellow communist slash socialist like this, who knows how they would have treated a Balite.\n\nIf you're traveling to this city, chances are that you're a merchant or a trader of some kind, and if so, a few words of warning. Move quickly, don't mention to the ponies that you don't agree with their country, and leave as soon as you can. This city might seem friendly on the surface, but I would shudder to behold what they might do to capitalists."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_170:0 "In the years following the formation of Equestria and the unification of the three tribes, ponies began to spread outward in numerous waves of colonization. Marechester can trace its history back to one of these migrations, and has been a permanently settled pony city since at least the 200s BLB. From the abundant archaeological evidence, there is reason to believe that it was a major trading hub between the Crystal Empire's furthest reaches to the north and other, unincorporated pony kingdoms and city states to the south. However, there is scant written record of Marechester from its earliest periods, with later mention of it common, but uninteresting in writings from greats like Ponemy and Marecus Maretony.\n\nThrough the ages, the city has remained a central location, as its placement upon one of the smaller lakes in central Equus allowed it to become a regional shipping port between other towns as they appeared. Before industrialization, it had influence in the mining guilds of the region, as one of the only producers of high-quality iron and other precious metals. This prominence among the other towns further centralized its trade power, and when industrialization began to spread in the latter half of the 800s ALB, Marechester was the first of the cities west of Canterlot to embrace that revolution. As the area around Marechester had soil perfect for growing flax, its cottage industry of seamstresses and dressmakers exploded in short order to vast, and domineering textile factories, to feed the fashion-hungry in Canterlot, Manehattan, and to a lesser extent, Fillydelphia.\n\nAlong with this explosion in productivity, Marechester became a nexus of the arts and sciences within western half of Equestria. The University of Marechester pioneered the art of matrix power, which improved the quality of life of many ponies as the turn of the millennium approached. During the Great War, Marechester was bombed repeatedly by the changeling Luftwaffe, which reduced many of its industrial parks to rubble. Artillery campaigns flattened some of the great monuments of its day, including the Marechester Cathedral, a temple that had been used in times past to worship Celestia before it was discouraged and turned into a community hall instead.\n\nAlthough it emerged in the end, unscathed compared to some other cities in Equestria, the city soon fell to unrest after Daybreaker's ascension. Restoration work was glacial, with little funding from Sanctum Solar. Workers starved and the governor of the region was uninterested in resolving anything. In 1024, there was a full rebellion by workers and farmers of the region, who ultimately succeeded in freeing themselves and inspiring others in the north to do the same.\n\nDespite being free, resources are still scarce for the city. If one were to visit today, one would see there is extensive devastation from the changelings' bombardment of Marechester. Starting in the outskirts, one would have to pass by numerous amounts of rubble and debris and other mounds that have yet to be cleared by the workers of this commune. Skeletal remains of taller structures provide chilling reminders of the horrors of the Great War.\n\nThat is not to say that it is all doom and gloom. Although their city is still reeling, the citizens of the commune have a bright, friendly attitude to them. There is, however, an undertone of wariness or mistrust to visitors. The local worker council, like all the other communes, meets every other week to decide on important issues. Usually this is held in the public square, in the center of the city, and is packed to the brim. Recent meetings have sometimes devolved into violence, as tensions appear to grow over the loss of the eastern communes and the use of changeling mercenaries.\n\nTo that end, there is a small but noticeable changeling presence to Marechester. They are mercenaries, mainly Great War veterans, who have agreed to protect the communes in exchange for real love. It's not unheard of for visitors to be approached by one who will chat them up, offer a drink, and ask for a donation of love in return.\n\nIt's a far cry from the Equestria of old, but in its way, stands as a reminder that friendship doesn't have barriers, no matter what the higher powers say."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_191:0 "Situated at the mouth of a river and overlooking the Rich Sea, Cervus has been one of the major naval hubs for the Olenian deer. The Jarls of Cervus, at times preferred trading and at others raiding. Each year the fleet of longships would sail from the harbour towards distant shores and bring back their wealth. Cervus grew rich and the fine woodcarving of her buildings would soon be supplemented with gold, silver and gemstones. Many of the old wooden homes and halls still form the centre of the city, with the Jarls' Great Hall forming the absolute crown jewel of the city, a massive wooden hall, whose ornaments, are trophies from ancient times.\n\nHowever, the age of raiding is long gone and Cervus is now a modern city. After a population boom, the city has grown into the industrial heart of Olenia, with apartment blocks and factories surrounding the historic centre. Most of the initial factories belong to the Cervus Industrial Corporation, a conglomerate holding much sway over local politics and a big supplier to the Olenian government. Despite the encroachment of modernity, the harbour is still a pleasant site to visit, with modern transport ships sailing to and fro and many of the historic longboats still being kept in shipshape tradition by the locals.\n\nNote Jotter's Addendum, 1048 Edition: Around the Hegemony in Thirty Days.\n\nCervus is the most cosmopolitan of the cities in Olenia, while still maintaining a strong Olenian cultural identity. All around, deer will be moving to work in factories, or to sail off to distant lands, street vendors will sell wares from far off lands, and changelings will enjoy vacations. The deer of this city took to the subjugation by Changelingia the best, and quickly set about using their port city as a tourist trap to attract rich changelings, and as a port importing supplies for the war effort.\n\nThe main street of the city is lined with bastardized versions of Olenian culture sold for high prices to the ignorant visiting changelings. Axe throwing is offered for ten bits a head, a mead hall right next to it, what a disastrous combination, all while a shop sells 'authentic' Olenian tapestries for hundreds of bits of profit. In addition, capping off the main thoroughfare of the city, there is a casino stolen right from Las Pegasus, with bright flashing neon blues and greens, the Aurora Borealis. Bucks trot around wearing iron helmets with huge horns coming off of them, while does dress like barbarian-queens to attract sailors to come and spend all of their bits on mead, gambling, and company.\n\nFor the smart tourist, the best thing to do is to go off the main drag and to the side streets, where the actual culture of the city can be found. Local libraries where deer will read old history books and poems to those who want to listen, plays being performed based off of old Shakedeer writings, along with the beautiful temples of the Olenian gods. Enter into the temples with respect to the worshippers, and marvel carvings of their god of war, made out of the antlers of long dead enemies, and wooden paintings to the god of sailing, taken from longboats who once tried to conquer this great city. Always make sure to take some time to speak to the locals, and share a laugh over the behavior of the other tourists in town.\n\nCervus is a great visit for the smart tourist, and the side streets always seem to hide a new hidden gem of culture with every turn you take. Try and avoid all the tourist traps and go for the true authentic experience, and you'll have a wonderful visit, be you on a cruise, or a road-trip."

Here, he chose to build his home, and soon his followers settled next to him. Within centuries the settlement had grown into a §Ytrading port§!.\n\nSakara is best known for its historical role in the western §YViking expansion§!. Many of the deer who settled in §YAusturland and Hindia§!, who raided the coasts of Griffonia and Zebrica, called Sakara their home. So much wood around the city was used for building longboats that entire forests were cut down. The exotic wealth of far away lands made Sakara a truly prosperous place, the greatest city in Olenia.\n\nBut all that was many centuries ago. Now, Sakara is a city known for its §Ywooden buildings§! which have a tendency to burn down once a century. Modernity first arrived in eastern Olenia, and Sakara was always slow to adapt. As such, the city is a §Yconservative stronghold§! in Olenia, its inhabitants still clinging to their old traditions and retelling the same old sagas about conquests of distant lands. Yet even Sakara cannot avoid §Yindustrialisation§!, as the city's merchants have opened many new factories in the city's outskirts in recent years. Time will tell if the city will ever learn to let go of its past.\n\nNote Jotter's Addendum, 1048 Edition: Around the Hegemony in Thirty Days.\n\nSakara, a large, relatively isolated city on the western coast of Olenia, this city's distance from Changelingia has led to it being one of the only cities to still hold a true taste of Olenian culture. Changelings, other than the odd veteran of the navy, are nowhere to be seen, nor are many ponies, as this is the true home of the traditional deer. Factories work in the distance, but through the city center, and the docks, everything looks right out of a history book.\n\nSakara is a city proud of their history, having a long legacy of sailors who would raid distant lands, and come back laden down with gold and silver. This city is filled with historical monuments, such as to Jarl Harald Hardtrotta, an ancient Jarl who almost completely conquered the coastline of the north, but was stopped at Ditrysium. More modern monuments line the streets, memorials to sailors lost in the wars against the changelings and against the ponies, with many deer coming to pay their respects to the fallen.\n\nOnce you've finished visiting the memorials, it's best to head to the many museums, such as the Sakara Musuem of Tapestries, holding famous tapestries from the city's past, even including the famous Bayou Tapestry, which is two hundred and thirty feet long, detailing an ancient war against thestrals in south-east Equestria. Or its neighbor museum, the Sakara Arms and Armor Musuem, filled with well preserved and lovely pieces of old war gear.\n\nOnce you've emerged from the annals of history, there's nowhere better to head than to a local pub or bar, where local deer will gladly offer their special city drink, Vellum Mead, named after an old Jarl. The deer in this city, despite their pride and strength, are quite friendly if you're friendly first. Ask about their families, and their past victories and wars, ask about the history of your drinks, and the food you're having, and the deer of this city will regale you with poetic tales of wars long past.\n\nSakara is a must-go place for anyone who wants to experience Olenian culture, there is no substitution. Take a cruise along the Hegemony's coastline, or pop in on the train, but if you want to experience a piece of true deer culture, there is no better place than here."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_221:0 ""Never has there been such a wretched hive of scum and villainy. My kind of folk!" – Cerebrum, CEO of Nidhogg Industries, when asked about his opinion of the various corporations that control of Yukka Island.\n\nNew Yukka City as of a couple of decades ago never existed. In fact, were it not for the South-East's secession, it would still be an undeveloped stretch of land in a sheltered bay on Yukka Island's northern shores. That it alone houses half a million creatures from every continent and dominates trade going to and from the Changeling Hegemony by way of the Canterbbean speaks of the dedication to profit that the corporations that leased the island from the South-Eastern Governorate pursue.\n\nCompared to their neighbors, the citizens of New Yukka City barely live in any better conditions. Walking along the streets of the city, one would be constantly bombarded with advertisements claiming to meet any need, whether that be physical, mental, or emotional. It is not uncommon to see a corner store claiming to be a one stop shop for alcohol, drugs, weapons—corporate-approved, anyway—or a dozen other different wants and desires, some completely unknown until the customer arrives.\n\nAt night, this assault on the senses barely abates, as the majority of the streets have at least one neon sign from a corporate outpost or depot, from which loyal consumers can earn discounts as long as they remain regular and don't buy from company rivals. To facilitate this, citizens are given different company accounts with their employer, as well as any corporations which have signed sponsorship contracts. It's generally accepted that a new employee will receive a two percent discount on any goods of their employer, as well as one percent savings on whichever companies have sponsorship deals with them.\n\nIn the streets themselves, the mercenaries hired by the different corporations as private security—a common affair when espionage is feared in a city still dominated by changelings—can rough up any citizens they deem to be suspicious, so long as they have the right licenses with the reigning changeling corporations. Likewise, the Protectorate—otherwise referred to as the PRT—the local police force on the payroll of the changeling companies, are frequently seen investigating employees for supposedly randomized screenings. Outside of convicted espionage, however, citizens that are arrested are instead further indebted to their employers, and made to work extended shifts without additional pay or chance to earn overtime.\n\nFor the tourist, attractions vary. Much of New Yukka City is company property, and therefore off limits to non-employees and non-citizens. However, there is a small section around the Membrane Port that contains a number of casinos, movie theaters, a sports arena, and various chain restaurants and trinket shops from across the world. Twice a day, tours are provided by the PRT to see towering skyscrapers of the city center, as well as Heartstone Plaza, where the headquarters of Nidhogg Industries, Panacea, and NYC Arcanomechanics reside, as well as corporate branch offices of a number of Vesalipolis-based companies and Griffonian and Zebrican businesses. In the day, these glassy towers glisten in the southern sunlight and look like crystal beacons of wealth and prosperity. At night, they are illuminated by height-spanning advertisements and neon signs, appearing as blazing pyres of avarice and hedonism that the corporations encourage. Only in these lights is the true heart of the little island revealed, as the lusts of her masters exploit land and creature alike for every ounce of money, before casting them aside for flashier and more addicting vices."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_239:0 "Before §YNova Griffonia§! and before §YWeter§!, §YNouvelle Aquila§! was established at the mouth of the §YDulli River§!. In the beginning, it was little more than a camp for §YRilan§! fishergriffs and whalers on their journeys, allowing for a safe place of rest after weeks at sea. However, over time trade with the local ponies and yaks meant that more and more Aquileian griffs stayed there permanently, creating a small, sprawling town outside of official Aquileian control.\n\nWhen §YAquileia§! fell to the §YGriffonian Empire§!, it was both a great boon and a great trial for §YNouvelle Aquila§!. Thousands of Aquileian refugees, many of them wealthy merchants and nobles, made their way to the town and carried their wealth with them, more than doubling the population and increasing the town's wealth many times over. Yet, at the same time Nouvelle Aquila had had time to develop its own political system of elected mayors and a town council, a system that clashed with the royalist leanings of many of the newcomers. In the end, it was the arrival of Griffonian Empire's fleet and the demand for subjugation under the new colony of §YNova Griffonia§! that stopped things from exploding into outright fighting.\n\nAs Griffonian settlers began to arrive in the town as well, the Aquileian refugees chose to keep to themselves, creating what would become known as §YThe Aquileian Quarter§!, a district of the city that even to this day has a clear Aquileian feel to it in everything from the cuisine to the architecture and even the language. In some ways, this region has kept hold of old cultural artefacts from the old kingdom more than Aquileia ever has.\n\nAlso, ever since its inclusion into Nova Griffonia, the city has considered itself the actual heart of Nova Griffonia, viewing Weter as a colonialist overlord not truly part of the colony. Nouvelle Aquilan Griffons have always been eager to settle the deeper regions of the colony, explore new opportunities, serve in the Nova Griffonian militias and however they can leave a mark on their homeland. Weter may the Griffonian Charter, but these descendants of those Aquileian refugees and fishers have worked tirelessly to create their own niches. Weter remains true to the old homeland, Nouvelle Aquila embraces the Nova Griffonian way of life. Weter is a hub of agriculture and industry, Nouvelle Aquila makes a niche for itself in steelworks and logging. Weter builds a university, Nouvelle Aquila will erect a grand theatre. One can call Nouvelle Aquila proud, stubborn or spiteful maybe, but nogriff can ever call it lazy, cowardly or sedate.\n\nNote Jotter's Addendum, 1048 Edition: Inside Sinister Serov's Steel Shield.\n\nThe largest city in Stalliongrad's hold over Nova Griffonia, Nouveau Aquila is held by many as being the true capital of this northern extent of the Shield of Steel. Continuing millions of griffons alone, this city is by far the largest in the remnants of the Western Griffonian Empire, and with this size has come issues, and poverty. While the Worker's Republic of New Mirabelle might be under Stalliongrad's protection, it doesn't have much help with its economy, and here, that can be seen more than anywhere else.\n\nWhen Marelandia overran Aquila, millions of griffons and ponies fled, some of them going to Skyfall, or the Empire, or any other safe place in Griffonia, while many fled to the Western Griffonian Empire, specifically to this city, where a large population shared their culture. When Griffonia continued to fall into madness, even more fled to this city, welcomed by the quickly collapsing Western Griffonian Empire. When the WGE fully fell, and Stalliongrad marched north, this city rose up, led in a coalition between Victor Allard and Sugar Crepe, a Griffon and pony veteran from the Aquilan Revolution. They fought against the Empire's troops, who came to try and crush their revolt, but with revolts all over the empire, the small, yet powerful, Nouveau Commune found themselves independent.\n\nRefugees from all of Griffonia, and even quite a few communists from the Riverlands, would flee to this shining beacon of liberty, rapidly growing the city's population beyond capacity. However, Stalliongrad's Northern Campaign would arrive at the gates of the city, demanding a surrender. The city, overfilled with griffons and ponies, with infrastructure and industry decimated from the Empire's attack, would eventually surrender. Allard, accordingly, managed to convince Crepe and the other leaders to offer surrender, allowing this great city to fall under Stalliongrad's control.\n\nNow, this city still suffers from a strong overpopulation issue, as millions of foreign communists and harmonists suffer silently in overcrowded streets, with their dictator, Iron Grasp, not doing nearly enough to help them. This place is peaceful, compared to most of the world, but its inhabitants are filled with a fire of freedom. Aquilian flows freely from the mouths of ponies and griffons alike, responded in kind by Lakish and Bakaran, speaking tales of revolt, revolution, and freedom. Police wander the streets, looking for any dissidents, unaware of the dangers right under their beaks."

Constructed shortly before Emperor Highhill's death, it now stands as a beacon for all the suffering workers of the various splinter states of the §YWestern Griffonian Empire§!, at least on its surface.\n\nMost of the buildings are nothing more than simple prefabricated shelters, built of steel or rapidly-drying concrete, all hidden under the forest canopy of the §YVerfaultwald§!. As a small settlement before the shattering of the Empire, its only ornate buildings are the governor's quarters and the assembly hall, now converted into Prime Prole Joseph Talon and the ABP's parliament, respectively.

With the rapidly-expanding nature of the Verfaultwald, forestry is a primary export of the town. Heavy machinery and equipment create a constant racket from across the river as workers mine at the stone quarry to use in building projects across the country.

Enter the Royal Spire as a visitor and be prepared to be searched in every nook and cranny for the suspicion that you're a spy or something worse.\n\nOnce you're finished with being violated in rights and principle by the guards, look closely at the new architecture inside. The columns and the rooms are, despite the aged look from the outside, brand new, and the conversations are not about who to oppress, but rather how to best prepare for the final war. The outskirts of the city reflects this too. While there were once fields, now massive industrial complexes and tenements tower there, all less than a decade old. They are the symbol of what the Changelings can do together, provided they have a common enemy. And yet, problems are teeming in the city. After the unification of the changeling race, the city has perhaps grown too quickly for its own good, becoming one of the largest cities in the world. Many apartment spires and homes are overcrowded and in serious need of new suburbs and satellite towns to offload their excess population to. To make matters worse for Chrysalis, the new course has not been popular with all and hushed voices speak of a resistance to her. But the hypothetical opposition had better be wary. The Queen's Guard patrol the streets, hunting down any sign of dissent.\n\nBut for a time, take to the skies and look down upon the city. You can clearly distinguish the old from the new, with the old core being slowly 'eaten' by the urban renewal taking place. And yet, you can see the march of progress. New machines in the streets and in the fields, new fashions and societal ideas in the halls of power, and new ideas of warfare and destruction in the armed forces. Truly, Vesalipolis is a microcosm of the Changelings.\n\nNote Jotter's Addendum, 1048 Edition: Changelingia Traveling For The Curious Travelers.\n\nVesalipolis, the beating heart of the Changeling nation, the epicenter of all trade, technology, and creation in Equus. Trot the paved sidewalks and watch as the richest changelings drive by in cars, painted bright, flamboyant colors, with purring engines and honking horns shouting at any bug who tries to use a crosstrot. Trot within the shadow of the Great Queen's Tower, a tall spire of dark making that extends high into the sky, a symbol of the Queen's power and authority.\n\nVesalipolis exists as a near utopia of a city, as long as you're near the center of it. Homeless changelings aren't seen at all, pushed instead to the industrial outskirts, and a sense of national pride fills the streets, as veterans and citizens trot and live side by side. Enjoy visiting Victory Museum, a giant museum built about the Great War, trot down Victory Avenue and try out the local's favorite spot, the Pinball Palooza Plaza, a selection of pinball museums looted from Equestrian cities. If you're looking for a more niche taste of culture, visit the Olenian District, where loyal deer citizens, veterans of the Great War and their family, mix together Olenian and Changelingian cuisine, traditions, and culture. Or take a visit to Griffonia Square, an entire plaza built in the style of the Griffonian Empire, a celebration of the Attaché and alliance between the Changelings and the Empire long ago.\n\nWhereas in the past, changelings would be suspicious of any visitors, now, they're positively hospitable. Any tourist is sure to be given a discount from any local bakery, directions and a smile from any local, and thorough tours through the city, all in the hope that the tourist might give them some love. This isn't to say, of course, that the city is all hugs and kisses, as Military Police roam the streets at every hour, a symptom of an oversized military culture that prevails in Changelingia. However, if you keep your muzzle clean and stick to the city center, any tourist will have an unforgettable experience of Changeling culture.\n\nI rate Vesalipolis 5/10 for trotability, the city is dominated by cars in a lot of areas. I rate Vesalipolis 3/10 for flyability, the skies are congested with hundreds of changelings at any one time. I rate Vesalipolis for museums and events 10/10, it doesn't matter when you come, the city will always have something happening. Overall, 8/10 for visiting, only visit if you like crowds and socialization."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_252:0 "The Hive of Ditrysium was one of the first to ally with Vesalipolis when the hives were being unified, which paid off immensely for the port city. It is located at the far end of a protective fjord, allowing ships natural shelter from the elements. As one of the major commercial hubs for the changelings, Ditrysium is the link of the Changeling Lands to the outside world. It is also where the changelings are preparing their advancements in naval warfare. Drones buzz endlessly around the dry-docks to manufacture warships for the hives. In heavy concrete bunkers, meanwhile, the U-boot fleet hides in the deepest secrecy. The exact size and scale of the submarine operations are a state-secret of the highest order.\n\nSurprisingly for a changeling hive, Ditrysium does have some more colourful elements, perhaps the foreign ships coming into port do help spread some cheerful influences. The city is relatively wealthy, courtesy of Queen Helvia and her predecessor lobbying successfully for commercial investments into the hive. Nowadays, most of the changelings in the city work to maintain the Grand Changeling Armada based in Ditrysium's naval base, a fleet which the changeling admiralty hopes will one day best the Equestrians on the high seas. Thus, although Ditrysium might be the changeling hive benefiting the most from outside contacts, it too is being repurposed towards the all-encompassing war effort of Queen Chrysalis.\n\nNote Jotter's Addendum, 1048 Edition: Changelingia Traveling For The Curious Travelers.\n\nDitrysium is a larger version of Vaverfront, and a city that is, partly, in decline. Of course, Changelingia as a whole is undergoing an economic stagnation, and Ditrysium suffers this the most. During the Great War, this port city served as the primary point of trade between Changelingia and the entire world, as ships from everywhere would flow freely into this harbor, selling their wares and resources for the changeling war effort. However, with the annexation of Vaverfront to the south, most ships sail to there instead, the warmer waters being more welcoming to foreign trade than the cold arctic waters that this city holds. The streets of this city are filled with veterans of the Great War, sailors of a navy now left mostly useless, along with hundreds of homeless bugs, unable to find jobs in this city in decline.\n\nNear the old quarter of the city, one can see the remains of the greatness this city once held. Art museums and archeological museums sit right next to gifts given to ancient queens from ancient realms. The Changelingia Naval Aviation Museum is one of the largest museums in the entire country, dedicated to the use of naval aviation during the Great War, both by the changelings and by Equestria. It's sister museum, the Changelingia Museum of Naval History documents clearly the development of ships, all the way from wooden sloops to dreadnoughts of steel. Finally, my personal favorite, the Queens' Museum, founded centuries ago, has happily kept the history of every Queen who has ruled this city. Of particular interest is an interactive exhibit, where foals, fawns, and nymphs can dress up as Deer Vikingar to learn about the invasion of Jarl Herald Hardtrotta, an ancient Jarl who sold from Sakara all the way to here, to try and conquer this great city.\n\nHowever, outside of the old quarter, tourists should beware, many homeless veterans and old merchants have turned to pickpocketing travelers, or scamming. You can't trot fifteen seconds without seeing a beggar, or a scam artist. In addition, any traveler or tourist needs to be careful of the Love Gangs that lurk the streets at night. Gangs of young, desperate changelings, usually Hardliners of changeling politics, who will beat up and kidnap any creature who's alone, so they can drain them of their love and sell their love energy on the black market.\n\nI rate Ditrysium a 2/10 for trotability, much of the city is taken up by wide roads, used decades ago to transport materials inland, and trotting in certain areas can be very risky and dangerous. I rate Ditrysium a 0/10 for flyability, I would highly recommend for no creature to fly while here unless you have a large group, lest you get knocked out of the air by a Love Gang. For museums and attractions, I rate Ditrysium a 7/10, yes the museums in the old quarter are quite good and relatively cheap, but outside of the old quarter, there is not much for a traveler to do. Overall, I rate Ditrysium a 5/10: only stay for a day or two before quickly moving on."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_259:0 "For the longest time Vraks and Vesalipolis have been rivals on the battlefield. For centuries, the changelings of Vraks have fought against their bigger northern neighbour with all their might. Sensing weakness in Queen Chrysalis, the hive led a full on assault on her home, which was only barely beaten back by the Queen. Years later, Vraks would be humiliated and finally put down and Vesalipolis would become the changeling metropole. The Vrakkians have now accepted the hegemony of Chrysalis, accepting her strength and excited to battle new enemies.\n\nUnder the rule of Queen Argynnis, Vraks has used its martial prowess to become the backbone of the changeling military and the centre of her war production. Black clouds of smoke continuously envelop the city, the result of a massive military industrial complex which covers a good third of the city. In Vraks, the barracks for the soldiers are almost indistinguishable from the houses of the factory workers, a matter of great pride for the city's inhabitants. All work for the soldiers, who in turn serve the hive. The only truly remarkable structures in the city are monuments to past battles, most of which are concentrated on a massive square called "The Field of Glory".\n\nA perceptive observer might note that the Field is not yet completely filled.\n\nNote Jotter's Addendum, 1048 Edition: Changelingia Traveling For The Curious Travelers.\n\nVraks is a city which exemplifies the Changeling martial tradition, its bugs are hard, all either veterans, reservists, factory workers, or mothers raising the next generation of warriors. Long gone are the days where Vesalipolis and Vraks would be rivals, now, outside of sports, the two are actually rather friendly, though many Vrakians do think that their northern neighbors are snobbish or weak. Unlike Vesalipolis, many Vrakians don't take kindly to other species, ponies are looked at with looks of disdain, and deer are seen as soft, effeminent, and weak due to their war losses. But, for veterans of the Herr, no matter if they are covered in chitin or fur, there is no kinder and more accepting place than Vraks.\n\nThe city often has military parades, organized by local leadership, which always end up marching through the main attraction of the city, The Field of Glory. The Field is a large plaza square, filled with memorials and monuments to past wars, telling tales of great glory and horrible loss. Step amongst the obsidian obelisks and read the names of hundreds of years' worth of dead changelings and realize that the martial tradition of this city is never ending. Monuments of the Great War rest right next to a monument of the Fall of Vraks, when the city was conquered by Queen Chrysalis. There are many military museums as well, serving to teach the next generation the ways of past warfare. Swords, spears, and crossbows rest next to gigantic Panzers and trucks forty years out of date. The main attraction rests near the center of the museum, a suit of armor belonging to Queen Tarsus, who led a Vrakian mercenary company that fought alongside Nightmare Moon a thousand years ago. Look and tilt your head, and watch the light bounce off of well polished silver-steel and the dark chitin of the armor, the suit of armor being forged out of chitin ripped off of Tarsus' greatest enemies. \n\nI rate Vraks 10/10 for trotability, the changelings of this city live an austere lifestyle and owning a car is almost unheard of. I rate Vraks 6/10 for flyability, it's kill or be killed in these skies, Vrakians aren't afraid to shoulder any slow flyers out of the way. I rate Vraks 5/10 for museums and events. If you enjoy war history, you'll love Vraks, but that's all that they have. Overall, 6/10 for visiting, only visit if you like war history or weapons, and think twice if you aren't a changeling and plan to visit."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_262:0 "Far to the northeast, on the shores of the Key Lake, Soryth stretches out. The sprawling hive is built in what the changelings would consider a non-crowded way, but for other creatures, even Soryth might feel cramped still. Key Lake is the reason why so many changelings endure the cold winters of the north of Equus and it is the city's most valuable resource. For some unknown reason, the lake exhibits magical properties, making it a valued object for study and a source of clear drinking water.\n\nThe city itself straddles the coast of the lake and is way longer than it is wide, with most changelings preferring to live as close to the waterfront as possible. Luckily, waterborne transportation makes it easy to move from one side of the city to the other and the lake is always filled with boats of all shapes and sizes. Because of the northern climate and the relative lack of industry, the air is clear and the city itself feels clean and tidy, a reprieve from some of the more industrialised hives. The main point of interest is the Soryth University of Magic, an institution devoted to the study of the changelings' innate magical abilities, as well as the understanding of the properties of Key Lake. With the promise of increased funding and plenty of field testing for her magical research, Queen Yaria of Soryth joined Chrysalis without a fight.\n\nNote Jotter's Addendum, 1048 Edition: Changelingia Traveling For The Curious Travelers.\n\nSoryth, one of the most unique cities in Changelingia, this city has maintained its unique identity in the years after the Great War, unlike many others. The city has expanded to consume even more of Key Lake ever since its full annexation from the Polar Bears, and no matter the time of day, the lake is filled with boats. Trotting through the city center, one thing any tourist will notice is the general intelligence of this city, as nearly every changeling here is well studied. Continue trotting, and eventually you'll come across the Key Lake Research Facility, a research facility founded before the Great War, which studies the nearby lake, and many other things. Many changeling scholars flock to this city, either to try and join the research facility, or to teach at the many schools that call this city home.\n\nBut of course, one can't talk about Soryth without talking about Key Lake. Legends say that this lake has magical water, somehow remaining clean, even with all the boats traveling through it. If you're visiting, there's nothing better to do than to take a sip from the lake, and taste the magic for yourself. If you're lucky, you might even encounter a changeling scholar, who will be able to talk your ear off about the water for hours, and provide much more information about the lake than anyone else could.\n\nOf course, travelers should be careful in Soryth, the city gets extremely cold, and it's not advised to travel here in the winter, or to stay outside after night falls. In addition, if you're traveling outside of the city, be careful and bring plenty of heat sources, the snowy chill claims dozens of lives each year. In addition, Soryth is further away from the other major cities, so if you plan to drive here, make sure you drive safely over the ice-covered roads, or you might never arrive. Finally, of course, there is a small population of Polar Bears that call the city home, especially on the eastern side of the lake. Polar Bears are generally not aggressive, but try not to make one angry, unless you're looking to be made into a snack.\n\nOverall I'd rate Soryth a 0/10 for trotability, you pretty much need to rely on public transport, a car, or a boat to get around the city. I'd rate Soryth a 0/10 for flyability, the air is usually too cold and it snows too often for flyers to be able to fly without freezing their wings off. I'd rate Soryth for museums and activities a 6/10, there are some science museums and cultural exhibits around the city. Overall I'd rate Soryth a 4/10, only visit if you like the cold."

It is said that the fortress has never fallen to storm of nature or storm of swords. An impressive claim, as the great hold stands in a region endlessly plagued by storms. It is rumoured that §Dlightning§! strikes the §rstarsteel§! rod that rises at the very top of the hold daily in an imitation of §RClan Svartpels§! elder and warlord initiation ritual.\n\nWithin this great fortress it is said that there are great spaces dedicated for warlords and warriors to rest and train, entire armories of ancient panserbjørn armor and the great traditional axes of bearkind. Even such things as forges and manufactories exist within its great halls, enough to equip an army in merely a year.\n\nAnd finally, it is rumoured, that §Adeep, deep, deep beneath the earth§! does the hold stretch, perhaps as large below as above. And it is here that the great Svartpels §tarchives§! are located, where thousands of years of ursine history its warlords and despots and tyrants, its cultures and methods of war are all documented. Yet only the ursine magi-scribes and clan elders are allowed here and no foreigner has ever been allowed here under punishment of death.\n\nNote Jotter's Addendum, 1048 Edition: Traversing the Ruins of Western Griffonia.\n\nOnce the great home of Clan Svartpels, the Hold of old has been reduced to ruin, and replaced by a modern city. Highly damaged already during the Second War of Polar Bear Unification, it was effectively rebuilt from the ground up after a narrow victory by Clan Scyfling brought this under the united rule of Paw Wellington. This unification would be short lived, as soon after the Polar Bears unified once more, they were attacked by the Western Griffonian Empire. This Hold put up the most fight of any of them, but under a constant barrage of artillery, the great spire of their Hold would collapse, and Clan Svartpels would be fully annexed and assimilated into the Empire.\n\nThis city would serve a very important purpose, being one of the two ways into the Polar Bear lands from the rest of the Empire, connecting together their Polar Bear territories with the Penguin territories. Being so important, the Empire would rebuild this city, not in the image of a Polar Bear Hold, but of a proper Griffon city, with large, heavy buildings of brick and stone, accompanied by wide streets and the railroad. However, despite the Griffonisation of this city, the pride of the Polar Bears who once held this city never fully left.\n\nWhenever the Emperor died, this city was amongst one of the first to rise up, alongside the city of Bjornelanding. Here, a state would be created, a state for Polar Bears alone, the only Polar Bear state there is. The bears here are proud, and strong, and, above all, they thirst for blood, and revenge. Operating under a supremacist framework, these bears look hungrily at all their lost lands, and at the Griffon states, those who once sought to oppress them.\n\nFor those outside of this city, beware, for the bears are awake, and hungry for revenge. If there's one thing any northern dweller knows, it's that you never mess with a hungry bear."

Far more isolationist than Yakistown, Saihan Tolgod is effectively a closed city for non-yaks. Built by generation after generation, it is not even remotely a planned city. Ancient thatched roofs hint at its age, and rumors of lake monsters have kept even some yaks away. But that's how the inhabitants like it.\n\nAt the central point of North Equus, this was the capital of the Khaganate of centuries ago. Winford's decision to move his government to Yakistown was very controversial, and the Jakichikh were delighted when Bradford launched his secession--not only to have their city a capital once more, but to show that even one of the Mangchijid princes had had enough of the harmonist nonsense!\n\nWhile a Ghenikhan might bemoan the nightmarish working conditions in the mills, the workers are fed a steady stream of information (some might say propaganda) of how their lot in life is not only good enough, it is far, far better than the horrors of Ghenikhan's atheistic communism.\n\nNote Jotter's Addendum, 1048 Edition: Traversing the Ruins of Western Griffonia.\n\nCapital of the Yah Clique, this city is used to being a place of glory for warlords in the Yak lands. Used long ago by the Khagnates, it was also utilized by Bradford's short-lived rebellion against the last yak prince, Rutherford, and has the scars to prove it. In modern times, this city has seen disaster and rebuilding. When Rutherford's armies marched onto the city, they, as Yaks do, smashed it to pieces, smashing ancient relics and venerated artifacts, as well as smashing the palace that Bradford lived in. Rebuilding had only really just begun, with the Western Griffonian Empire encroaching from the west and the north, through their territory in Nova Griffonia and the Polar Bear Communities. Griffon artillery smashed what remained of the city, reducing away ancient yurts and destroying the final hints of identity that belonged to this city, as they marched west to Yakistown.\n\nWhen the war ended, this city was rebuilt by the griffons into an industrial paradise, as this city held an important place on the railroad, connecting together many different regions of the Empire. Yaks were forced to work hard days in factories, producing goods for the Empire. Yet, at every turn, the Yaks would resist. Veterans speak about the casualty rates of this city, how nearly half of the military police shipped in to keep the town in order would end up being killed. The Yaks of this town, despite hating communism, engaged in its most core tenants, often going on strike or destroying machinery to ensure that the griffons could get no use out of it.\n\nA revolution happened in this city a few days before the Emperor died, where underfed and angry Yak workers rose  up, smashing apart the local military police headquarters, and any nearby griffons to death, unless they joined the revolt. They say that Virgil Junior was the field marshal assigned with pacifying this city, ensuring there would be no disruption in supply headed to the front with the changelings. However, upon hearing of the death of Emperor Highhill, the encroaching army would turn and leave the Yaks alone, securing their own nation.\n\nNow, this city rises once more. Yaks stand angry, upon the ruins of a once great capital, their eyes turned upon all others, those who fought them, those who oppressed them.

Now, they are carried into battle by furious Yaks, thirsty to restore the glory of their Khagnate, and to smash all in their way."

Yet the capital hold of §YClan Scyfling§! is no such mere thing. Like a giant cobweb the great hold covers leagues upon leagues upon leagues of territory. For from the centre of the hold, which has now grown into the first true §3city§! of the bears, which rests upon a peninsula that juts into the frozen seas of the North, the great raised roads of ice plunge across the northern wastes. And after tens, if not hundreds, of kilometres they end in smaller holds of their own. A great time ago these holds were connected by an §6outside wall§!, one that lays mostly ruined these days. For what powers or numbers maintained it cannot be found in the modern clan.\n\nAnd yet despite this great size, one that would dwarf even the greatest cities of griffons and ponies, much of this land between the true hold and outer walls is §gempty§!. Much of it remains §gwastes§!, only sometimes interrupted with farmer settlements for the whelps that take care of tubers and roots, and holds and holdings of clanless bears. Even rarer still are statues and shrines to §DAll-Father§!, many of them enduring even as holds or settlements they were part of turned into ash and dust.\n\nSo great is this vastness is that there are lands which were never marched upon by ursine armies. While usually such lands are merely more ice and snow and taiga, there are rumours of §1great abominable beasts§! and §1singular creatures§!, older than the current bear civilization that dwell within.\n\nYet after §YPaw Wellington§! returned from his exile this great vastness is being transformed. For slowly more and more holds are raised and built by bears attracted to the lands by the great experiment of §Yursine unity§!. And the first city of ursines is expanding. While it's merely a dream now, some claim, that perhaps in merely a few generations, the largest of all cities will rise from the fortified skeleton of §YClan Scyfling§!'s capital hold.\n\nNote Jotter's Addendum, 1048 Edition: Traversing the Ruins of Western Griffonia.\n\nOnce belonging to Clan Scyfling, this city was the capital of Paw Wellington's kingdom, and as such, it was not highly damaged during the Second War of Polar Bear Unification. Whenever the Western Griffonian Empire came marching to the Polar Bears, by the time they reached this great city, the Polar Bears had already surrendered. In a show of mercy, the Emperor made this city the center of administration in the former Polar Bear lands.\n\nThis mercy led to an interesting development, especially when the Emperor marched south and destroyed the Yaks. With a direct rail line built between here and Yakistown, these two nothern species realized that they had quite a lot in common. Yaks and Polar Bears would happily move into each other's lands, creating a fusion of both cultures, of Polar Bear strength, and Yak resilience. This can be seen even more modern day, as the streets of this city are lined with artwork from both cultures, and happily houses both species.\n\nThis mixture would prove a recipe of disaster, however, as when the Emperor died, it was the strong Bears and the tough Yaks who were among the first to revolt. Mathair Fearainn and Yakistown stood together in unity and solidarity, leading a realm not fully Yak, nor fully Polar Bear. Modern day, this city is a capital in all but name, holding nearly half of the entire population of the Smushton Clique within its borders. \n\nPolar Bears in this city happily prepare alongside their Yak comrades, as the two species prepare to march east, to try and reclaim the glory of both species. However, in this city, even as factories belch smoke into the air, and soldiers march to the front, there is a feeling almost like dread. Dread, that to the west lays an empire beyond compare, and dread that strength and toughness might not prevail, should the swarm descend on them next."

Lyctida is a sombre place, but for many changelings, it is still home. The hivelings are bugs of few words, preferring the company of machinery or the solitude of the forests. With the streets silent, the scenery drab and the company stoic, Lyctida receives few visitors.\n\nOnly once has a sizeable group of foreigners visited, but this was with unfriendly intentions. Olenian zealots once tried to assault the city, in the name of their violent gods. Only with the timely intervention of Queen Chrysalis were the deer driven from the forest hive. This incident earned Chrysalis the loyalty of the Silent Hive and its Queen. Now the humming of the factories creates a new melody, the march to war.\n\nNote Jotter's Addendum, 1048 Edition: Changelingia Traveling For The Curious Travelers.\n\nLyctida is not a large city, in the context of Changelingia. Surrounded by the Black Forest, named in relation to the color of the chitin of the changelings, this city has always been known for its lumber industry, even during the war, this city would produce many of the wooden stocks used for guns, wooden crates used to transport materials, and any other items that can be made from wood. Despite their use of the forest, though, the changelings of this city remain highly respectful of nature and the forest that surrounds them. Many factory drones, once they're done at work for the day, will take strolls through the forests, where they are often played with and treated as friends by the local fox, birds, and rabbits.\n\nMuch like the forest surrounding them, these changelings are dark, their senses of humor are on par with a funeral home's, their clothes are all simple and muted colors, and smiles are only seen when they trot through nature. Small note, do not ever mention to a Lyctidan changeling that you saw them smile or laugh when interacting with animals, they hold their serious and stoic selves as a point of pride. These changelings are simple in every way, they live for routine, waking up, going to work, trotting through the words, falling asleep, they don't push for anything new or unique, and are happy to live the same life as all their ancestors.\n\nHowever, this city is a goldmine for nature lovers, as the unique northern forests of Changelingia are usually hard to get to, but here, the forests surround the entire city. Grab a pint at a local pub and ask some locals about their favorite trails, they'll tell you all the best spots, the beautiful views, what animals to be careful about, what to bring and what not to bring. If you're lucky, some changelings might even invite you to go on a hike with them. Don't be put off by their neutral expressions, though, they might not smile or seem happy, but these changelings love nothing more than sharing nature.\n\nIn addition, this city is home to some of the most oddly hospitable changelings in the nation. If you have a flat tire, if you get lost, or if you don't have any place to stay or food to eat, these changelings will be the first to step up. Like everything with these changelings, they'll not smile a single time, but if your car has an issue, they'll fix it up immediately, if you need some extra food, they'll gladly give it out, if you need a bed for a night, they'll give it, if they respect you. These changelings are all about respect, pay them the proper respect, don't try to push them to be something they aren't, and they'll respect you back, and become the most steadfast companions in the world.\n\nI rate Lyctida a 10/10 for trotability, the city is quite compact and you'll have no issues trotting anywhere you need to go. I rate Lyctida a 8/10 for flyability, as long as you keep pace, you'll be able to fly anywhere. I rate Lyctida for museums and entertainment 5/10, if you don't like nature, you won't find much here. Overall I'd rate Lyctida a 9/10, maybe don't stay for too long, but if you need someplace to stay for a night or want a few nature hikes, there's no place better than here."

Crystal City, one of the largest settlements in the world, to this day, is no exception. Since its return in 1002 ALB after banishment for a millennium by §gKing Sombra§!, it became a center of art and culture for the Crystal Ponies and [CRY.GetNameDef] as a whole. But that §Ygolden§! era would not last for long.\n\nWhen the city was first founded on §PPrincess Amore's§! ideals of love and fellowship, its traditions carried it far. Despite the one thousand years of banishment by Sombra in retaliation to Princess Celestia and Luna's assault, they recovered quickly after their return. For a few years, they prospered, grew, and industrialized. While the transition was difficult for many, the guidance of §YPrincess Cadance§!, a distant descendant of Amore, brought them into the modern age. Yet all the preparation was for naught.\n\nWith the §RGreat War§! falling up on Equus, [CRY.GetNameDef] came to Equestria's aid, but the little empire was too ill-developed to assist. When Cadance was forced to sign a treaty with the changelings, the city's economy slumped, although it never quite collapsed. Much of its production from its nascent industry was demanded of by the changelings, and attractions like the §YCrystal Stadium§! and the world-famous §YCrystal Spa§! fell into disrepair. Within months, a tenth of the working population relied on the now-strained resources of the government, but that was far from the worst.\n\nAfter the ascension of §ODaybreaker§!, the Crystal City was seen as one of the last bastions of the old ways of Harmony on Equus. Those that could still flee Daybreaker's new Solar Empire did, and the city's population burgeoned in a manner of only a few years, gaining hundreds of thousands of ponies who escaped before the fallen alicorn could oppress them. Yet these refugees have remained a drain on the city.\n\nBeneath the shining exterior of the Crystal City, a sick, blackened heart lies, undulating and writhing, waiting to expunge the vile blood that has twisted it to its core. If one walks the streets of the city, while they could see the grand, shimmering spires of the §YCrystal Palace§! or the elite §CAmethyst University§!, they would also see the shanty towns, the refugee settlements, and the growing homeless population. Unrest is common, and patrols of the under-equipped Crystal Guard can be frequently seen going into the refugee camps to squash violence before it spreads.\n\nEven the §CCrystal Heart§! is feeling the effects of the tension that has settled upon the city. For the first time since Sombra was defeated, a blizzard swept through the city on Hearth's Warming, 1047. Temperatures have continued to plunge, and the lifeblood of the city, and [CRY.GetNameDef] itself, has grown cracked, brittle, and ready to shatter. On the surface, the city may seem alive and well, but peeling only an inch of skin away reveals the truth.\n\n[CRY.GetNameDefCap] died long ago.

state_lore_text_container_state_description_525:0 "For generations, the city of Albion remained a quiet, if lively city situated along the Equestrian east coast. As part of the expansion north of the ponies, it can trace its roots back to settlers from Manehattan venturing along the shore, searching for new places that they could use for trading ports and mining. Eventually they found a place at the mouth of the small Hooflet river, near a secluded bay that could harbor ships from storms that occasionally blustered up the coastline. From there, it remained a marginal port for trade further north to Petershoof or to Skyfall, and its population stayed steady at around seventy thousand ponies.\n\nHowever, with the industrial revolution underway and industry spreading further from the large cities of Canterlot, Fillydelphia, and Manehattan, Albion was soon discovered to be resting upon a large deposit of bauxite, which could be refined into aluminum for any number of uses. When word of the surveys was spread, the modest settlement ballooned in a few short decades to around half a million ponies as workers were required for the bauxite mills and mines. With the invention of the aircraft and later determination that the strong yet low density metal was worthwhile for parts, a dedicated industry to manufacturing planes or plane sections was born.\n\nBy the turn of the millennium, Albion was still far from an important city, but one that had prominence as one of the only regions in Equestria that could help support the airforce. When the Great War broke out, investments into the aircraft industry further motivated economic migrants to relocate there. After Equestria's defeat, it hovered around seven hundred thousand ponies, and nearly topped eight hundred by the time Sinister Serov invaded in a backhoofed blow, where it has remained under his influence since.\n\nAlbion did hold out against advancing forces for a few days, but many of the worker unions, feeling repressed by Daybreaker's new government, overthrew the mayor and ambushed the garrison there. As a reward and as a means of easier bureaucracy, Sinister granted a swath of southern territory that had been liberated to the worker unions in the city. This was the birth of the first socialist republic, the Democratic Albion Ponies Republic, who went about instituting total socialization of property and the economy.\n\nHowever, the first unionists were not seen as radical enough by others, and within half a year, the first republic was overthrown in a coup d'état and the Free Democratic Albion Ponies Republic was established in its place. This trend continued for a number of years, leaving the streets bloodied and buildings damaged, until the current republic stands where it is today. In commemoration for each new republic, the ponies of Albion—renamed Free Albion—have taken to creating new, larger monuments to the liberty of all workers, the world over.\n\nIf one were to visit Free Albion today, one would be able to see a number of sights, beginning with the Liberation Square, where there currently reside five statues, each grander than the last, in perfect sequential order, commemorating the foundation of each republic. Beside the current monument to the foundation of the modern government, there are another fifteen plots, ready to be filled in case the leaders of the republic are not dedicated enough to the Revolution.\n\nLocal governance in the city is handled by various councils, overseen by the Ministry of Council Oversight, which in turn is overseen by the Ministry of Freer Oversight for the Ministry of Council Oversight. It is not uncommon to see signs beside perfectly mundane items. If one were to travel south from Liberation Square, there is an entire block where each apartment is curated by a different workers council. To wit, there is a monthly council meeting on the maintenance of park benches, as well as a separate meeting for the quality of flags produced to fly from every house.\n\nAdditional places to visit in the city include the Workers Wharf, where the Freedom Fleet moors and protects the city from any naval threats. There are also a number of pubs and inns for visitors and sailors, each serving their own unique brand of goulash, potatoes, and hardtack. The local drink is a pale ale that has been described as "only tasting MARGINALLY like piss." Lastly, to the west of Liberation Square is the Daybreaker Hate Museum, which is officially known in law as the Free and Anti-Fascist Anti-Daybreaker Anti-Solarist Freethinking Historical and Correct Memorial to Recalling and Hating the Anti-Democratic Anti-Free Fascist Actions of Daybreaker Museum. Inside its main, and only, exhibit, one can see the facts laid bare of Daybreaker's reign, including that she kicks puppies, eats foals, and never brushes her teeth, so sayeth the ever knowledgeable Council of Accurate Historians."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_1214:0 "The §gGrey City§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_1214:0 "Settled a few hundred years ago as a seasonal fishing village, the old city of Baltimare was the largest in the Equestrian South-East, and dominated local industry and trade. Although it wasn't long before the fishing village was permanent, much of its growth didn't occur until the Industrial Revolution, as its natural harbor in Horseshoe Bay allowed it to become a hub of shipping and manufacturing in the ensuing decades.\n\nMuch of Baltimare's history is of little note, as it developed along the same lines as other major Equestrian cities. Aside from explosive population growth thanks to the Industrial Revolution, its only contribution to the larger Equestrian social fabric was raising awareness of the socialist cause across the world. As it was one of the first and largest protests against perceived oppression by industrialists, when the mayor of Baltimare cracked down upon it and was then replaced by Princess Celestia, it was seen as a socialist victory. Since then, various unions such as the anarcho-syndicalist CAN-TER had a presence within the city.\n\nThis backdrop of communist support primed the charge for revolution after Equestria's defeat in the Great War and subsequent stalemate with Stalliongrad's Liberation War. When taxation became too much, the unions organized and stormed the armory, overpowering the garrison and launching the South-Eastern Secession War. Afterward, it did not take long for the new Solar Empire's navy to respond, and the city was blockaded to prevent support from other socialist powers, especially MARESOC. The blockade was soon ordered to shell the city in preparation for recapture, and for months the city was bombarded to pound it into submission.\n\nHowever, the victory for Daybreaker never came, and the South-East was freed under Cobalt Hoof, who was propped up by MARESOC. Cobalt returned a hero to Baltimare, but the city itself was in ruins. From its ashes, and with the support of MARESOC—a relationship short-lived—the first parts of Baltimare were reborn as New Baltimare. To match the MARESOC style, the new structures are as brutalist as can be. Little variation exists between apartment buildings and skyscrapers, which are constructed of basic, flat concrete, with small, suffocating windows. Every structure is at least ten storeys tall in the inner city, which lends to a dizzying wind tunnel effect throughout the core.\n\nIn exactly the middle of New Baltimare, the new Freedom Commons encompasses a full square kilometer of the center of the city. Within the heart of that, the vast Governmental Complex rises above all other buildings in the city by at least twenty storeys. As the only building of any flair, it houses both Cobalt Hoof's living quarters, the offices of all Inner Party members, as well as a number of planning and government centers. In each corner of Freedom Commons, one of COBSOC's ministries, perfect replicas of MARESOC's, present an imposing presence that glares down into all who walk through the square.\n\nAlso in Freedom Commons is the first monument to Cobalt Hoof, which depicts him standing triumphantly, pressing a hind hoof onto Daybreaker's head. This is mimicked by a sister statue in Stableside's governmental quarter, although it is ten feet taller. In reaction to this, there are further monuments to Cobalt Hoof's leadership in the South-Eastern Secession War, each more impressive than the last. Along the docks, one depicts him rescuing a dozen foals while manning a four-pony artillery piece by himself. The current count of statues is in the dozens.\n\nThere is little culture to speak of regarding New Baltimare, given it is tightly controlled. Buckball is the local sport, with droves of ponies required to attend. The only cinema in the city is bursting with attendees, always to see the latest movie on Cobalt's heroics against Daybreaker's oppression. Nothing else from the old city has survived, save rubble between the inner city and the overcrowded outskirts. That suits COBSOC fine, though. There is little reason to remember the past, when all that's needed to be known is that Cobalt is the future and always will be."

Indeed, the first encounters between the two races occured near §YFort Acorn§!, the predecessor to the city itself that was founded by Equestrian settlers who colonized the uninhabited wilderness of northwestern Equestria. Different sources explain the nature of these outcomes differently. According to Equestrian historiography, it was cautious but ultimately friendly, as ponies presented gifts to the strange shapeshifting creatures. Traditionally, Changeling records did not mention gifts, but during the reign of §GQueen Chrysalis§! history has been reinterpreted and the encounters are seen as hostile and even violent.\n\nWhatever the case, the fort soon became a trading post, and then a town. It was the only place in Equestria where ponies could acquire finely woven §GChangeling silk§!, so commerce boomed and thousands of migrants arrived. Changelings arrived in the city as well, initially living in a separate quarter but soon integrating into the populace, often shapeshifting into ponies to fit in better. Acornage was - and still is - the one place in the world where one can see changeling hive spires next to traditional Equestrian houses.\n\nWhen the changelings were unified under one nation in 982 ALB, the border of the newborn country was drawn right next to the city. Equestrians agreed to Chrysalis' demands, thinking it would be the foundation of a friendly relationship between the two nations. They would later regret this when relations soured and the complete lack of a buffer zone made the city strategically vulnerable. Despite the rising tensions, business in the city continued as usual, with the local changelings and ponies remaining on friendly terms. This changed in §R1002 ALB§!, when Canterlot itself came under attack. The treacherous stab at the heart of Equestria shocked everypony, especially the inhabitants of Acornage. Overnight, the mood in the city changed, and many saw changelings as unreliable and a potential fifth column. Racial harmony was replaced with racial tensions, and thousands of fearful changelings fled the city across the border.\n\nAfter the initial harsh reactions, the situation calmed down as Chrysalis licked her wounds in Vesalipolis. There was an attempt at making amends, but most citizens felt like there was no going back. Yet, deep in their hearts, the inhabitants of Acorange know that their home city is proof that changelings and ponies can not only get along, but be true friends with one another.\n\nNote Jotter's Addendum, 1048 Edition: Changelingia Traveling For The Curious Travelers.\n\nChrysalia, otherwise known by its old name, Acornage, is a city which is almost entirely new. During the Great War, the Equestrian army tried to hold this city, even using the historical Fort Acorn to do so, but under artillery barrages and the tread of tanks, this city was almost entirely destroyed. Once the war ended, this city, as part of the territory directly annexed by Changelingia, was rebuilt into a symbol of the Hegemony, a city where ponies and changelings live side by side, peace kept by commerce and police.\n\nUnlike some other cities in Changelingia, this city hasn't undergone an economic stagnation, but instead, has been steadily growing more and more. This city serves as the gateway to Changelingia, and hour by hour can a tourist hear the trundle of trains down the tracks, bringing gold, oil, and love, all that a changeling could ever need. This city also welcomes hundreds of cars every day, soldiers being deployed to Vanhoover, or soldiers being moved back from Vanhoover, or soldiers on shore leave, sharing drinks and merriment with locals. The city is dominated by a culture of the automobile, as all of the old districts of the city were destroyed during the war. Now, the streets are filled with cars driven by families from nearby suburbs, riding into the city to work in offices or factories, before driving back once work is done.\n\nThe city is home to quite a few museums and monuments. The ruins of what once was Fort Acorn have been turned into an amusement park, Nymphland, where nymphs and foals alike pose for pictures with changelings disguised as war heroes, and they can go on rides. Apparently the Trimmel Tunnel is quite the popular spot for young couples, and of course, the Pharynx Phalanx, a bumper cart arena, is quite the popular spot for young changelings and ponies alike. However, if you're visiting Nymphland, do avoid Kute's Mirror Maze, a maze filled with magical mirrors that teleport you around if stepped into, it's a great place to clip your own horn on something.\n\nI'd rate Chrysalia 6/10 for trotability, the wide roads and common cars mean there's always the potential to be hit by a reckless driver. I'd rate Chrysalia 8/10 for flyability, due to the amount of cars, the skies are usually clear for a flight. I'd rate Chrysalia for museums and attractions a 9/10, the amusement park and museums are all a fun time for all ages, but the city lacks a feeling of tradition and culture. Overall I'd rate Chrysalia a 8/10 for a visit, it's a great start or end to a trip around Changelingia."

While initially little more than a military outpost meant to control the strait to the north, it rapidly grew from the various explorers and ambitious settlers who saw §YNova Griffonia§! as the place to build a new life beyond the confines of the empire. Weter became one of the main ports of entry in the region, leading to a population explosion during the late 800s and early 900s that took Weter from a small frontier town to an actual city. It became considered §T"The Gateway to the West"§! and hundreds of thousands have entered Equus through the Weter Harbor, hoping for a new life in Nova Griffonia.\n\nWhile Nova Griffonia is an immense region, most of it remains frontier regions. Weter, near uniquely, is more like Griffonia than the rest of the nation, with tighly packed old-style buildings near the city centre and an opulent gubernatorial palace overlooking a city plaza in which a statue of Grover I stands. Further out, however, the Griffonian veneer fades quickly, and already at the outskirts of the city one can see the more uniquely Nova Griffonian identity spring forth. This has always been Weter's role in these lands though; to stand as the link between Nova Griffonia and the old homeland, enforce imperial order and ensure that this rugged and harsh land far from Griffenheim remains a testament to the Griffonian Empire's drive and ambition."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_1218:0 "Cloudsdale can trace its roots to the very founding of a united pony nation, and even to the times before that. As the first and most prominent of the pegasi cloud cities, when the pegasi were their own city states, it retained the most honor and prestige. Many of Equestria's early military tactics were derived from pegasi war schools, adapted for grounded races. The first royal guards were all pegasi, due to their innate, warlike demeanor.\n\nIn the centuries that followed §YCloudsdale's§! founding and later integration into Equestria, the city remained stationed nearby to §YCanterlot§!. This purpose was twofold. One, it being also near many earth pony settlements, plus the predominantly unicorn Canterlot meant that it was seen as a diplomatic gesture by the other races to the pegasi's loyalty to the Crown. Two, it provided quick and easy access to Canterlot in case of war, either for defense, or for offense.\n\nAs this early-Equestrian thought process eventually faded away and a more typical standing army was created, Clousdale maintained much of its military history and pedigree, but also branched into other services. The first §Cweather factory§! was built in Cloudsdale, and it was also the largest in all the cloud cities, as it could service a majority of the central heartlands when it was in full operation. Culture and arts flourished, predominantly focused around athletics and war games. One of the highlights of that era was the §YCloudeseum§!, which hosted the annual §YBest Young Flyer§! competition for the fastest and most acrobatic up and coming fillies and colts could showcase their skills.\n\nMuch of this came crashing to a halt during the §RGreat War§!, where Cloudsdale focused heavily on reforming its military industry and supporting Equestria through officers and tactics. When Equestria collapsed and formed into the §YSolar Empire§!, for a time, it and the cities around it remained loyal to §ODaybreaker§!, but slowly drifted away, both figuratively and literally. In 1026, after illegal elections were held to appoint a new governor, the newly-elected §YSoarin'§! approved relocating the city to the Twilight Range mountains for outwardly strategic and supportive reasons to the Empire. After it was moved, the pegasi went about fortifying the only ways to the city.\n\nCompared to only a decade ago, Cloudsdale is a heavily locked down settlement. Although much of its architecture retains the vapor-based pillars and high halls, hardened thunderclouds are used as bunkers and gates to important regions of the city. It has become a veritable maze of checkpoints and guard houses, and an assaulting army would find it difficult to gain much traction. Above all of this, the governor's palace that was constructed by Daybreaker towers over the skyline, although its imposing edifice is softened by the standards of the city, not the Solar Empire's flag.\n\nDespite all this, the city itself still runs along smoothly. Clean industry releases only steam or vapor into the sky, and at the high altitude, the sight of the mountains beneath draw tourists from across the Autonomy and other heartland rump states. Although it had been postponed for a number of years, the §YYoung Flyers§! competition has recently resumed, and is another point of interest in the city for any visiting travelers, as a reminder of the portions of Equestrian society that have not been lost."

On either side of massive marble statues to Big Sister, Inner Party members spew their rhetoric about the wayward nations, informing attendees of their prosperity through new, more beneficial production numbers and numerous other lies and falsehoods.\n\nMuch of the culture and charm of Sunset has been lost, with the only remaining pony-griffon hybrid architecture being that of the §YEventide Opera House§!, now converted into a sports arena of the bloody pastime of §RNukeball§!. Party members are forbidden from watching, as they have more productive things to accomplish than the mere proles that infest the lower streets.\n\nAnimosity and fear float over the city like a thick fog. On almost every street hang posters from the Party, with their recognizable slogan of "WAR IS PEACE. FREEDOM IS SLAVERY. IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH." Telescreens broadcasting the latest news from the fronts against the Griffonian Empire and the League of Free Nations keep a close vigil on the masses. Choking ash and smog belch from the industrial parks of the peripheral settlements, coating almost everyone and everything in a thick layer of grime.\n\nWith so few remembering the before times of Marelandia, hope has been successfully suppressed by the Party. Whispers of the proles one day waking dart around like electricity, but they are quickly silenced by MARESOC's Thought Police. While liberation may come someday to Sunset, it would be through blood and tears and piles of bodies.\n[eaw_state_lore_356_addendum]"

state_lore_text_container_state_description_362:0 "§YNote Jotter's Clarification§!: Like all the cities within the territory of §RMARESOC§!, what is known of the modern history of §YNew Manehattan§! is almost nonexistent after §GNew Mareland§! fell to their coup late in the first decade of the eleventh millennium. All history books are about forty years out of date, and most "guides" to the world contain nothing more than hearsay and superficial observations from ships and airplanes that are woefully outside of reasonable distance to discern anything in fine detail. This makes it incredibly difficult to provide accurate information for the esteemed reader, as MARESOC isn't keen on the idea of tourism.\n\nHowever, that does not stop them from shouting to everycreature who will listen about their supposed history, and informational booklets have been smuggled at times out of §RMarelandia§!. What follows will be a reprinting of their latest informational piece for their citizens, printed §tin this format§!, with my own knowledge and corrections appearing §7in this style§!.\n\n£line_break\n\n\n§tManehattan. Our second-strongest city. Our populousest, trueest Revolutionary city. The largest city in the world. Everycitizen who lives here loves bs and the Party. From the moment of birth, they work for her. They love her.§!\n\n§7Highly politicized, but that is unsurprising. The true name of this city is New Manehattan, after the Equestrian city of the same name. It is accurate that New Manehattan is the largest of the old colony's cities, and is a key to its industrial base. It's far from the largest on Griffonia, let alone the world. Karthin is presumably larger than it is. Note also the Newspeak.§!\n\n§tFor those lucky enough to be selected by the Party to live in Manehattan, you are in bs's presence! Go to Party Square and be with your comrades for the Two Minutes Hate, where all doubleplusgood citizens cheer bs as she tells everycitizen how she keeps us plussafe from thoughtcrime. When everycitizen is done, see the plustall apartments, built from oldcrete. Only bs could carewise fix again these to be gooder! All other countries seethe with doupleplusanger when they see us upstretch for the sky!§!\n\n§7In this word salad of a paragraph, what can best be deciphered through the Newspeak is that Party Square has most likely replaced Canterlot Gardens Plaza, which was built at the center of the city to house some of the different local government buildings. Aerial reconnaissance from the 1020s that has been found from the Solar Empire confirms that most of the apartment blocks have been repaired to at least a functional state. Current estimates place that about ninety percent of the infrastructure still operates as it should. Presumably, where there was once the local courthouse and city hall is a massive monument to the Party and Big Sister. This is typical of other locations where the Two Minutes Hate is practiced in Marelandian cities.§!\n\n§tPostseeing these apartments, every doubleplussmart citizen will go to work in the Leisure Strip. For doublepluslength this circles around Manehattan and okays the citizen to see all the plusgood places when unworking. Downcity is the dockyards, where our doubleplusstrong carriers are builded for unmoving everycreature that threatens everycitizen. Citizens okay to visit where doubleplusbad uncitizens unpeaced from Aquilea tried to unbuild Manehattan in a malaction, but bs plusprotected everycitizen. In there is a doubleplusgood statue to her and the Party, builded by happy citizens doubleplusthankful for bs saving them.§!\n\n§7Additional Newspeak mangling of the Ponish language. This recommends working in some of the harsh factories in the city, which, from reports, belch smoke and soot into the atmosphere at alarming rates. Most of New Manehattan hangs in a dense smog that more than likely affects the lifespan of its citizens. At least as much as living in Marelandia will, anyway. New Manehattan was the site of a large conflict between the Aquileans and Marelandians, but unlike this blatant propaganda, New Manehattan was heavily damaged in the fighting, and estimates place that roughly half the city was leveled. Expectations are that it was as much the Marelandians fault as it was the Aquileans. Additionally, the harbor and dockyards of New Manehattan appear to have been expanded in recent decades, and employ a significant number of workers. Dozens of ships appear to be built there every year, but it could also be fabricated entirely.§!\n\n§tPostseeing this, when doubleplustired, return to the Thoughtful District, where everycitizen has been gived a doubleplusbig apartment by the Party! Every other country unsay that! Antesleeping, look for planes from the airport downflying and know that bs is watching you from the sky and the telescreen. You will never be unsafe with her! Watch the Statue of MARESOC stand in the water and welcome all of Marelandia to the doubleplusgoodest city in all the world!§!\n\n§7The Thoughtful District is most likely comprised of the different boroughs of New Manehattan. Houses are at a minimum, with most buildings being at least medium-density apartments, but very frequently high-rises built after the war with the Aquileans. Since the reconstruction, a new airport has been built, which stations some of the fighter squadrons of MARESOC for defense and for what can be presumed to be enforcement. This covers the pamphlet. Final thoughts on the matter can be found in Appendix A, along with all other considerations with Marelandian cities.§!"

With its ornate buildings, bustling byways, and storied monuments, it stood as the pride of all the §YGriffonian Empire§!. Even when the nation slowly collapsed, the old city remained steadfast in its Imperial tradition.\n\nFrom the §YImperial Palace§!, the great apparatus of the Imperial bureaucracy kept the Empire on its feet hobbling along to one day reawaken and reclaim its rightful land. When that day came, it was ultimately the downfall of the great city.\n\nIn the war with §OMarelandia§!, Griffenheim was in constant threat by the bombers of the aggressive communist nation. Despite suffering many bombing runs already, the city was leveled even further when the greatest weapon of war, a §Rbalefire bomb§!, was dropped on it. In seconds, the Imperial Palace was destroyed, before the regent Eros or Grover VI could be saved, snuffing out the fire and strength of the Griffonian Empire. Successive attacks decimated more of the city, leaving it nothing but smoking craters and ruins.\n\nNow, Griffenheim is nothing but a §Ywasteland§!, still sickened and filled with the radiation of the balefire that was unleashed upon it. Skeletal remains of the once-great buildings are all that survive to remind griffons of their heritage. Monuments dedicated to the Grovers are slagged, stumps only of the proud lineage of emperors. Dead still dot the streets as the magical radiation keeps the bodies from decaying, providing an eerie graveyard of the population that was trapped there. All that is left of the palace is a smoking crater and some walls along the edges of the compound.\n\nA new saying has sprung up in griffon lexicon to memorialize the beating heart of the Empire. \"Transfixed by marble and gem, we were too blind to see that a god walked among us.\""

At the very tip, a strange sight would greet any creature foolhardy enough to challenge the frigid conditions. A city – vibrant and alive – resides amongst the dead and dying plant life of the former §RDread Peninsula§!. Simple cottages pour smoke from their chimneys, and mostly ponies can be observed traveling the dirt streets.\n\nThe metropolis of §YRedemption Bay§! rests on the former location of the necromancer nation, the Dread League's de facto capital of Magehold. A stark contrast to the city of death, Redemption Bay is a bustling settlement, filled with many of the repentant necromancers, vampires, as well as their descendants. Magic crackles through the air, a mix of the latent dark energies still sewn into the ground and the communal friendship that these ponies have forged. Despite the sickly haze that surrounds the city and the forests enveloping it, the citizens keep an optimistic cheer to their activities.\n\nIn the center of the city, where the dark towers of Magehold once stood, there is a sole statue of the first king and queen of the Serene Kingdom of §YArcturia§!, William Steelbeak and Rosa Maledicta. Grateful citizens can be seen visiting and solemnly paying respect to King William for his sacrifice at stopping the mad necromancer Lichtus Regati. The stains of his foul magic still infest the soil, requiring additional work to properly grow any sustenance for the city.\n\nDue to the poor dirt conditions, Redemption Bay has become the primary exporter to the few nations still open to trade. In the waters of the Dead Sea rare fish that have been twisted by the necromantic energies fetch high prices in the River Federation and Northern Equus. Little in the way of traditional activities occur, as Magehold's population was too focused on their own passions to form strong bonds. The occasional magic show from a reformed mage is the closest there is to local entertainment, but the city is far from a popular tourist destination.\n\nEven though the latent influence of Magehold can still be felt, Redemption Bay is a testament to the power of forgiveness. The §Plove§! that William and Rosa had for each other helped seed the foundation for their northern industrial powerhouse, and the citizens are sure that whatever the future, their prospects shall only improve."

Arches carved directly into the single path that winds between the cliffs dangle delicately above any travelers who venture so far north. Massive gates hang open, ready to slam shut again like they once did so long ago.\n\nThe §YTarpian Rock§! is the fortress of the Serene Kingdom of §YArcturia§!. Founded centuries ago by Grandmaster Desmond the Fell-Claw, the castle town has long since expanded beyond its initial hilly defense. Sprawling suburbs of modest architecture flow around the great mound of earth, their inhabitants unknowing of the undead threat that invaded only a few decades prior. Spires of glass influenced by old steeples of the churches to the Sun Goddess show the advancements that Arcturia has achieved in such a short time.\n\nFor a few short years, trade flourished between both the §YRiver Coalition§! and the §YGriffonian Empire§! before the times of chaos and insanity arrived. Tarpian flourished, her people seeing skyrocketing §Gprosperity§! compared to their days of serfdom, and technology achieved comparable levels to the rest of Griffonia. When the Griffonian Empire stagnated in its war with §RMarelandia§! and the River Coalition unified into an authoritarian state, the city began to shrivel.\n\nSome blamed the necromancers that were forgiven and redeemed of their crimes for the troubles. They had caused undue harm before, what was there to say they weren't manipulating things again? This was despite the current king's lineage of Rosa Maledicta, the former Queen of the Dead. Without enough of the city on their side, she and her fellow ex-mages were driven from the walls, which accomplished nothing.\n\nDespite the burgeoning population and the steady food, the metropolis is slowly dying. §YAlbert von Maledicta§!, adoptive son of William Steelbeak and Rosa Maledicta, has shown his weak effect of resolving the problems as griffons hoard food and clash with the pony minority. Soon, the gates of the Tarpian may be closed again, although this time to keep the evil in instead of out."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_619:0 "Where Griffenheim was incinerated in a day in nuclear hellfire and Sunset was turned into a city-wide prison in the quest of control and tyranny, Rijekograd's modern history is nothing but stagnation and decline. For a few short years after the Riverlands federalized into a union of the various River Coalition members, Rijekograd was one of the marvels of the Griffonian continent. While Equestria fell to oppression and tyranny, the incumbent chancellor, River Swirl, ensured that her new country's capital was a sight to behold.\n\nAt the confluence of the Gold, Green, and Griffking rivers, the city has enjoyed a central location within the Riverlands for hundreds of years, surviving the griffon invasion led by Grover II and political tensions that almost boiled over into a civil war with Nova Whirl's communists in 1007. Its position allowed it to be a hub of trade and wealth after Grover II's death, and its population soared once the uneasy truce between the Coalition and the Griffonian Empire was de facto observed. Griffon traders were not unheard of, and frequently exchanged goods for some of the advanced thaumaturgic creations of the Kingdom of Wittenland, or the local wines and fruits from Deponya and Lake City.\n\nUnlike Griffenheim, Rijekograd has not lost its luster, at least outwardly. There has been no war that has destroyed it and left it as a reminder to fear MARESOC. Neither has there been bloodbaths from violence in the streets as disagreements rise between political factions. Yet much of the vibrancy of the city has been lost. Tourists can still visit the ornate customs houses built out of marble and lined with gold, or travel across the Gold River's bridge and through the Unija Cesta. The gardens are still well-maintained and can bring tears to some ponies' eyes at their beauty. Likewise, the governmental quarter in Avenija Republik is still the beating heart of the River Federation, with the Palaca Rijeke still the assembly of the Sabor and the River Parliament.\n\nNone of this has changed. In fact, new sights have appeared in the years since federalization. Across from the Palaca, a modernist statue of polished steel and chrome depicts River Swirl meeting with the other heads of state of the River Coaltion to sign the Acts of Unity. As a sign of its dedication to pluralism, the small griffon minorities have been given funding to create their own enclaves, where visitors can taste the cuisine of the lost Griffenheim or other Griffon territories. Yet a tourist must be careful. Along every street there is at least one police officer, frequently more, and military checkpoints are common throughout the city. "Random" inspections of citizens or visitors deemed suspicious by the law are common, and anything not liked by the officers can be evidence of threatening democracy.\n\nWalking off the beaten path toward other local sights, such as the marina district, where one of the oldest, and most ignored, custom houses in the city rests, one can see where the rot has set in. Rather than clean streets and pristine, polished houses and businesses, the non-touristy parts of the city are grimy, filthy, and filled with the homeless. Boarded up windows are the norm, and patrols of police officers are far less kind to the wandering explorer than those in the government-approved sections.\n\nIf it's possible to see a local election, it is an interesting experiment to experience. Although the constituent River Republic was one of the only democracies in 1007, it is now little more than a sham. Rarely is there more than one pony who runs, as anypony who goes against the current president winds up in scandals and drops out, or dead in mysterious circumstances. And that is where the ultimate corruption lies.\n\nThe heart of democracy has died long ago, and now all that remains are the vultures that feast upon its carcass."

In the center of this was §YMount Aris§!, the ancestral home of the hippogriffs and shared capital between it and the realm of the seaponies. Along its chiseled peaks and sloping ascent, hippogriffs lived their lives in splendor, the architecture a wonder of Zebrica with smooth, aquatic accents to the ornate and airy griffon-like spires and structures.\n\nIn the wake of the §CStorm King§!, the city was abandoned and then subsequently used as a trophy by the mad yeti before his defeat at the combined forces of Hippogriffia and the §YElements of Harmony§!. After his death, §YQueen Novo§! would go on to lead the assault on the capital, and it was purported that the streets outside the palace ran red with §Rblood§! of hippogriff and yeti alike. During the chaos, roving deserters of the Storm Kingdom looted what they could before they scattered, destroying many wonderful buildings in the process. Some of the priceless artifacts, such as the Feathers of Arista were forever missing, but it did not dissuade from Hippogriffia's resurgence as a major force for Harmony.\n\nUnder Novo, the city and the rest of the nation prospered as ties were established between various free nations in Zebrica, as well as Equestria across the ocean. It was said that the mountain capital was livelier than Manehattan or Canterlot, with the arts and sciences flourishing from the zebras and ponies fleeing war-torn or repressive nations.\n\nDespite a seedy underbelly of inequality, most creatures found their future in the §GArisan Utopia§!. Nocreature was left behind, for as the nation prospered, so did its poorest. It remained this way for years, until unrest grew at Novo's concessions with §RMarelandia§!, a mistake that would ultimately cost her, and the city, its life.\n\nIn the wake of the short war with MARESOC in 1017, Mount Aris was left nothing more than a §Rradioactive§! heap. Two nuclear warheads directly impacted the base of the mountain, vaporizing much of the lower quarters and killing hundreds of thousands before they had time to flee. The resulting blasts toppled most of the buildings of the city, and the fallout killed the rest. It was said that the screams of the dying were heard in the depths of Seaquestria.\n\nDecades later, the entire region is still deadly to any that enter without the strongest of protection wards. Crumbling palaces and universities are monuments to the promise that Mount Aris once held, as bodies from MARESOC's victims lay as a subtle reminder to those who dare oppose the all-encompassing §YParty§!.\n\nWhile Aris might have once been a utopic ideal of Harmony perfected, now it's nothing more than a necropolis of dead ends and past mistakes."
