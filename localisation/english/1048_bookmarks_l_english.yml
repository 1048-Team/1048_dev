 #GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A new era has dawned. Fear and uncertainty spreads amongst ponies as the world around them changes rapidly in front of their very eyes. Equestrian leadership is concerned about their neighbours, Stalliongrad and Changelings alike. While the communists in Stalliongrad rapidly industrialise, Queen Chrysalis has managed to centralise her realm around her. Equestria, while concerned about these developments, faces plenty of internal conflicts and problems. A storm is brewing in Equestria, one that friendship alone might not be able to tame."# moved to replace folder

 SOL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The great land of Equestria has fallen. For centuries it lived in harmony under the guidance of Princess Celestia and her maternal wisdom but at the dawn of the second millennium it would face its undoing. Queen Chrysalis united her country's bickering hives into a force that ravaged Equestria; Stalliongrad picked at the nation's corpse like a vulture. All this forced the once tame Celestia over the edge to ascend to godhood. In Equestria's place a new Solar Empire has risen under the iron hoof of Daybreaker Sun, God-Empress of all Ponykind. Although a shell of Equestria, it will be Equus' salvation from heresy, chaos, and disorder."
 CRY_1048_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "While relatively untouched by the Great War that ravaged Equestria, the Crystal Empire has fared no better. In the aftermath of Equestria's collapse, Cadance was left with a stretched-thin, but still numerically superior Changelingia posturing on their border. She had little choice when the envoys of Chrysalis demanded reparations, the result was a treaty signed at Gossamer Hills stunting the still-developing economy for a generation. After a war with Stalliongrad and two ill-fated campaigns into Equestria, the Empire is teetering on the edge. Cadance and her fellow refugee princesses must straddle the line between two great powers, keeping the weak flame of Harmony alive."
 BAL_1048_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Born in the fires of revolution, the South-Eastern Governorate is a politically isolated nation on the peninsula of the great Equus continent. After achieving freedom in 1021 from the oppressive hoof of Daybreaker, the MARESOC-aligned Governorate has bounced from one disaster to another. First Citizen Cobalt Hoof has steered the Party with an iron hoof since he took power, but there are rumblings of discontent as his health fails. As the jungles figuratively burn, the economy continues to spiral into the worst crash ever experienced on Equus, and even Marelandia ignores pleas for aid, the utopian dream teeters on the edge of ruin."
