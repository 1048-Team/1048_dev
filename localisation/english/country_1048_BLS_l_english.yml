For the advancement of science and knowledge, away from the restrictions and eyes of those like in the Solar Empire. There is much still to learn, and there is little time to waste."
  BLS_changing_directions:0 "Changing Directions"
  BLS_changing_directions_desc:0 "Our Director, Bunsen Beaker, has done great work in the past, but he has hit a bit of a snag on his primary project. While it is unfortunate, it gives ample opportunity to pursue his other ambition years in the making; plasma weaponry. Already close to completition, he is confident that with one final focused effort, it will be ready."

  BLS_work_with_the_directorate_desc:0 "The Directorate, a board made up of each of the five universities of Bales, has been quite the annoyance in years past for our goals.

  BLS_status_of_the_mechanicus_desc:0 "The Mechanicus Deus, a cult-like group devoted to knowledge and in large part our Director, has undergone a bit of an issue in recent years. Sharply split now between lines of ethics, tensions are always a present issue, yet an escalation of conflict is not something we can afford. Peace will be maintained between the two, at least until a more permanent solution can be found."
  BLS_unfortunate_realities:0 "Unfortunate Realities"
  BLS_unfortunate_realities_desc:0 "Bunsen is loath to admit it, but the writing on the wall is clear. If he is to finish the Plasma project in time, he will require additional help in the form of his Vice-Director, Stratus Stream. A talented and influencial researcher in her own right, her expertise will be invaluable, even if conflict between the two is sure to arise..."

  BLS_the_awakening:0 "The Awakening"
  BLS_the_awakening_desc:0 "At last, after so many millennia, she has been freed. The dawn approaches for Equus, and none shall escape the searing light of Her fury."
  BLS_first_follower:0 "The First Follower"
  BLS_first_follower_desc:0 "It is a strange and unnerving experience to awaken from slumber after thousands of years. To see odd ponies, descendants of the traitors, poking, prodding, and probing one's flesh even more. Yet, the Goddess has decided that one shall be spared. The one who made the "mistake" and overloaded the matrices that brought her back. She will die last, and in the meantime, she will serve well."
  BLS_atheists_everywhere:0 "Atheists Everywhere"
  BLS_atheists_everywhere_desc:0 "Untold ages have passed since the last of the generation that knew of Solar Flare died out. Now, society has progressed beyond its humble and dutiful reverence of alicorns as the deities they are. Ponies believe themselves masters of their fates, with their "knowledge" and "science" but they have fallen into infidelity instead. The Goddess shall correct this, and do so justly."
  BLS_thousand_year_nap:0 "The Millennia-long Slumber"
  BLS_thousand_year_nap_desc:0 "Although she was aware of her surroundings for the thousands of years she was sealed away, the Goddess has never seen the unbelievable advancement that the world has undergone while she was gone. Advanced applications of spells, electronics, refridgeration, among myriad other new things can prove overwhelming. Thankfully, there is a pony that can teach her all of it, whether she wants to or not."
  BLS_spare_nerds:0 "Spare the Smartest"
  BLS_spare_nerds_desc:0 "Unsurprisingly, with the sudden jump in mortality rate, many of the scientists and researchers in Bales and the surrounding universities have begun to flee before they become the next to meet Solar Flare, which is leading to a sudden brain drain. However, a number know Nebula Flare personally, and if she could convince them to swear loyalty with no requirement to worship the Goddess, then we could stem the worst of it."
  BLS_spare_jocks:0 "Spare the Strongest"
  BLS_spare_jocks_desc:0 "Untold throngs of ponies, more than ever lived in the domain of the Goddess thousands of years ago, toil in the factories and construction sites of the Directorate's designs. Since our savior's return, they have poured out in droves to fight agaisnt the few of us who currently serve her. However, she has decided that she will deal with this issue personally and correct their error."
  BLS_instruct_weak:0 "Instruct the Weak"
  BLS_instruct_weak_desc:0 "While those who were "convinced" by Nebula have stayed on, they are only simple, imperfect ponies who see no rhyme or reason to life. Because of their foolish worldview, they have cut themselves off from potential solutions to some of the greatest physical problems of their day. It is time she enlighten their empty minds."
  BLS_whelps_mission:0 "The Whelp's Mission"
  BLS_whelps_mission_desc:0 "Although Nebula Flare has proven her usefulness thus far, she has yet to convince the Goddess that she will follow orders completely, especially when her leash is slackened. Despite the Goddess's mercy through restoring her eyesight, she could still be rebellious. To prove her loyalty, she will be given the most important, but measurable task: the last High Priestess must be restored."
  BLS_first_task:0 "A Mighty First Task"
  BLS_first_task_desc:0 "Now that a number of workers have pledged themselves to Solar Flare, we can begin on recapturing the beauty of the former capital of the Goddess's empire. Thousands of years of erosion, weather patterns, and the effects of the final resurrection attempt have left it unrecognizable, but with these new bodies, the restoration will be accomplished."
  BLS_zealous_nerds:0 "Push Them to Zealotry"
  BLS_zealous_nerds_desc:0 "Bales primarily relied on a small, professional military comprised of perhaps a few thousand souls, with the rest being militia that would defend the nation if invaded by any of their neighbors. Only a few remained loyal, and they are also looking to desert. Yet the Goddess desires them to be the first of her new soldiers, and if it involves some coercion to stay, then so be it."
  BLS_correcting_primitives:0 "Correcting the Primitives"
  BLS_correcting_primitives_desc:0 "The Whelp has delivered a report of her findings, and after tracing the recorded history of Blazing Sheath's life - which was minimal - Nebula Flare has reached one conclusion. Blazing Sheath led the last defense of the Perditionem, and is somewhere in the same catacombs as the Goddess's resting place. Marechester will not appreciate the second visit."
  BLS_reface_land:0 "Reface the Land"
  BLS_reface_land_desc:0 "Now that the foundations have been set, we can begin to establish new blocs for the servants of the Goddess to reside and to toil. Great swathes of the outer-city will be reclaimed from nature so that we may construct great monuments to the Bright Day Star, and all those who see them will weep."
  BLS_mortals_dissent:0 "Mortals' One Dissent"
  BLS_mortals_dissent_desc:0 "As the difficulty of replacing ponies on short notice becomes apparent, the Goddess has decreed that she will provide mercy this one time to those who still fight against her will. All those in the military and militia must swear loyalty to her, though, lest her grace be revoked. It is doubtful many will be that foolish."
  BLS_fresh_blood:0 "Fresh Blood"
  BLS_fresh_blood_desc:0 "Having proved her mettle, Nebula Flare is the ideal candidate for working with the Goddess on her plans for punishing the world. As she is knowledgable on the modern world, she has experience where Blazing Sheath lacks, and her unique thinking will provide apt input for Solar Flare into the future."
  BLS_last_chance:0 "A Faithful's Last Chance"
  BLS_last_chance_desc:0 "As punishment for failure, Blazing Sheath had been left in torment, her soul stuck between this world and the afterlife. Now with her forgiveness, she has been provided the opportunity to show her competency to the Goddess again. Who else would be qualified to lead the Perditionem than her?"
  BLS_unearth_old_palace:0 "Unearth the Old Palace"
  BLS_unearth_old_palace_desc:0 "For part of our restructing of Bales, we will continue to excavate this "necropolis" that was discovered by the Directorate. In actuality, it is the buried city of Paelit, the Goddess's rightful home. What lays buried beneath remains to be seen, as the city was cleansed in the final war with the traitors. Only time will tell what secrets it holds."

  ###Leader Descriptions###
  POLITICS_SOLAR_FLARE_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: At least 5000 BLB\n\n§YBiography§!: Once, eons ago, the continent of Equus was a far different land. Pony settlements were few and scattered, and they kept their relevant cliques. Great pegasus enclaves floated in the sky, rarely trading with their neighbors above or on the ground. Earth ponies tilled the dirt, hoarding most of their crop for themselves, and barely providing for everypony else. Unicorns, the most powerful of the three, neither toiled for their food nor aided in weather. For the price of protection from harm, they were given what was left of the goods from the earth pony tribes. Frequently they would take more, leading to increased strife in all aspects.\n\nAll of this was not what they believed the great Faust, creator of the world and universe, had intended. She believed that her ponies would live in harmony, utilizing their innate talents to complement and support each other. Ponies had sinned, and they needed salvation.\n\nFrom this, two new ponies arrived one day in the heart of the early Equish Empire. They were an odd combination: They had the strength of earth ponies, the flight of pegasi, and the magic of unicorns. Both claimed to be descended from the great Faust. The elder sister, Elysia, was forged from a piece of the sun; the younger, Selena, was crafted out of the face of the moon. Together, they healed the divide between the three tribes, and for centuries, their rule created harmony in the land.\n\nIt would not last, as the three tribes began their squabbles. A chasm opened, ripping apart those who were loyal to the diarchs, and those who believed their individuality was more important. In the culmination of the combatting, Selena was captured, and subsequently killed. It was in that moment, Elysia realized her mother's mistake: Ponies could not be controlled. They would have to be punished instead. The world was corrupt, and she would bring its destruction.\n\nSolar Flare is the epitome of power: her veins pulse with the plasma that fuels the sun itself. Bloodthirsty, haughty, unyielding, Solar Flare has one overarching goal: the punishment of ponykind for its rejection she and her sister. For she is death incarnate, and Equus's debt is finally to be collected.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: cameil"
  POLITICS_NEBULA_FLARE_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: January 23rd, 1020 ALB\n\n§YBiography§!: Born in Manehattan, Nebula Flare was one of the first ponies to graduate from Daybreaker's School for Blessed Unicorns. During her time, she achieved great heights through her studious nature and her desire to improve her knowledge in fire magic. When she was in her graduate class, she met another promising student, Aurora Shinespark, and the two of them worked together on a few final projects that catapulted Nebula into the position as the first archmage of Manehattan.\n\nAs archmage, Nebula was assigned the unenviable duty of ensuring the compliance of the city in honoring Daybreaker. Manehattan had only recently recovered from the first communist uprising in the city, and both Nebula and Aurora were dedicated to seeing their home remain loyal to the Empress. Additionally, she was assigned Aurora's studentship to eventually guide her to become an archmage.\n\nNebula eventually grew disenfranchised with the Solar Empire. Although most ponies refused to expand their horizons beyond limited aspects of their field, she constantly searched new sources of knowledge. Some of these were forbidden in the Empire. From them, she concluded that Daybreaker was deceiving all of Equus. She was no goddess, merely an alicorn who was a pony like any other.\n\nFor a time, Nebula still served, but her two charges, Aurora and Nova Glow, noticed the change, and secretly investigated her. When she found out, she fled the city, and the Empire. Branded a heretic for her studies, she sought refuge in the Bales Technocracy, where she was coldly accepted until her initial research projects bore fruit.\n\nNebula is meticulous and patient. With a streak of sarcasm, she is prone to wait until more information is available until she makes a decision. However, she is obsessed with indications of alternate realities, and Bales under her direction has specialized in that field. Some say that she is not the true leader, but nopony has seen any indication otherwise, although a strange, pink pony has been seen visiting her lab frequently...\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Avrameow"
  POLITICS_BLAZING_SHEATH_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: Around 3875 BLB\n\nFor centuries after the apparent death of Solar Flare, the squabbling of the different pony nation states grew, as they no longer had a unifying force in the ancient alicorns of old. Pegasi moved once again to their cloud cities, sealing off vital resources for the earth pony farmers; the earth ponies refused to pay tribute to the unicorns, who in turn lashed out and sacked swaths of land as retribution for starving many of their communities.\n\nInto this chaos was born Blazing Sheath. Little is known of her past, for she is just as mysterious as the great goddess that she serves. Living initially almost five thousand years ago, Blazing Sheath was raised in a small village that was long lost to the sands of time. Precious few scraps are understood beyond that.\n\nSometime after reaching adulthood, she encountered a priestess of the Solaris Perditionem. At least twice in the past different prophetesses had arisen to lead the cult to attempt to resurrect their hibernating Solar Flare, but to no avail. When she met this priestess, it was to be a fateful day, for she soon learned the true gifts of her fiery abilities.\n\nWhile she had spent some time working with smithing tools for unicorn soldiers, she eventually stopped, disappearing entirely from her life with her family and in the greater region. Years passed, and she reappeared in the ancient Bales region, leading a secret sect of ponies who attempted to bring back the spirit of Solar Flare. It was to no avail, as its location was hard to hide in the grand library of the city. In the aftermath of the fight, she took her last few surviving members and fled north, to an ancient temple housing Solar Flare's body.\n\nPursued, she sacrificed herself to curse the ponies who would dare try to destroy her goddess, trapping her own soul in the catacombs of the temple. Now, resurrected to serve again Solar Flare, she is prepared to lead the armies of the undead cultists against all those who dare oppose the alicorn. Whether for vengeance for the years she lost to her family, or for a devotion to the sun goddess remains unseen. Traces of her descendants' past occasionally come to light, and she has gathered inklings of one who lives in the Solar Empire.\n\nYet not even familial status will stop her. For in her own words: \"Solar Flare is light, and light must always purify the darkness from the world.\""
  POLITICS_BUNSEN_BEAKER_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: September 19th, 997 ALB\n\n§YBiography§!: Youngest of three brothers, Bunsen Beaker was born in Luna Nova, where he spent much of his time studying and reading, despite the heckling that he received from the rest of his family. Unlike many of the lucky who lived in the city, his parents barely had the money to afford him food, let alone send him to university like he dreamed. To them, wasting time on knowledge was pointless when they struggled to make ends' meet.\n\nEventually, though, after clawing enough savings to at least attend first year of university in advanced magic theory and how it interacted with the different races, he received a scholarship to finish his education in Solar Beauty University near Bales. From there, he graduated with honors before remaining on for a post-graduate research study.\n\nDuring the Great War, he remained low-profile and eventually received tenure just before Daybreaker ascended. Seeing how the universities were becoming more neglected under Daybreaker's rule, he grew to advocate for their funding and how they could assist the Empire. When Daybreaker remained adamant, he formed a cabal with various professors in the region, soon organizing a faculty and student uprising which removed the Empire from power in 1028.\n\nAs Bales' Director, Bunsen leads the Directorate of academics and heads different research projects of his own. Over the years, he's grown more obsessed with immortality and solving the final question of death, sometimes ranting about it unprovoked. Rumors abound of strange occurrences in his lab, but nopony dares venture near them, lest they disappear like some of his other strongest opponents.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: pfeffaroo"

  mechanicus_deus:0 "Mechanicus Acolyte"

  ancient_cultist_desc:0 "Mysterious and ancient, this pony is literally out of time. One of the resurrected members of Solar Flare's ancient Solaris Perditionem cult, this pony channels their leader's aggression above all else. They have little time to learn the new ways of the world, and happily sacrifice hordes of soldiers under them to the meat grinder of battle."

After all, they are worthy of punishment, too, and there is no better way to judge both sides than letting them kill each other en masse."
  timeless_fury:0 "Timeless Fury"
  timeless_fury_desc:0 "For millennia, Blazing Sheath sat in isolation only learning snippets of what the outside world accomplished. With every new piece of information she learned, her distaste for the opulence, the debauchery, and the irreverence to Solar Flare grew. Now unleashed as Solar Flare's supreme general, she has more than enough ponies to use to exact her own brand of punishment. Who cares if a few guilty get killed along the way?"
  jaded_pragmatist:0 "Jaded Pragmatist"
  jaded_pragmatist_desc:0 "One of the three former sirens, Aria Blaze is the most level-headed of her sisters. Contrasted to Adagio's renewed conniving and Sonata's constant ignorance, Aria has grown more irritable with time, especially since her suggestions have been ignored frequently despite their merit. Regardless of these sore points, she has taken a position of leadership in the military and has proven quite capable."
  steadfast_disciple:0 "Steadfast Disciple"
  steadfast_disciple_desc:0 "When the ponies banded together to prevent Solar Flare's resurrection the first time, Melting Point stayed behind to ensure a way for the future to know how to find the great alicorn and return her to the world. For her sacrifice, leading to her death in the ancient library, she has been made one of Solar Flare's generals, her stubborn and unwavering personality transferring to the troops under her command to hold off agaisnt any threat to her goddess."
  marshal_of_science:0 "Marshal of Science"
  marshal_of_science_desc:0 "Tasked with protecting the Bales Technocracy, Bright Vector has avoided multiple conflicts within the last twenty years due to his quick wit. In the case of conflict, he always prioritizes knowledge above all else, and frequently triple-checks scouting intel before attacking, which has saved his troops dozens of times in the past while serving in the Equestrian Army."
