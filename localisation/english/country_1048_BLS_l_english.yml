  ###Focus Trees###

  BLS_in_the_name_of_science:0 "In the Name of Science"
  BLS_in_the_name_of_science_desc:0 "As we enter yet another year in the history of Bales, it is ever-important to remember why we are here. For the advancement of science and knowledge, away from the restrictions and eyes of those like in the Solar Empire. There is much still to learn, and there is little time to waste."
  BLS_changing_directions:0 "Changing Directions"
  BLS_changing_directions_desc:0 "Our Director, Bunsen Beaker, has done great work in the past, but he has hit a bit of a snag on his primary project. While it is unfortunate, it gives ample opportunity to pursue his other ambition years in the making; plasma weaponry. Already close to completition, he is confident that with one final focused effort, it will be ready."
  BLS_work_with_the_directorate:0 "Work with the Directorate"
  BLS_work_with_the_directorate_desc:0 "The Directorate, a board made up of each of the five universities of Bales, has been quite the annoyance in years past for our goals. Yet despite that, they remain an important group should we wish to continue our necessary research. Ensuring their continued support is critical for our continued success."
  BLS_status_of_the_mechanicus:0 "Status of the Mechanicus"
  BLS_status_of_the_mechanicus_desc:0 "The Mechanicus Deus, a cult-like group devoted to knowledge and in large part our Director, has undergone a bit of an issue in recent years. Sharply split now between lines of ethics, tensions are always a present issue, yet an escalation of conflict is not something we can afford. Peace will be maintained between the two, at least until a more permanent solution can be found."
  BLS_unfortunate_realities:0 "Unfortunate Realities"
  BLS_unfortunate_realities_desc:0 "Bunsen is loath to admit it, but the writing on the wall is clear. If he is to finish the Plasma project in time, he will require additional help in the form of his Vice-Director, Stratus Stream. A talented and influencial researcher in her own right, her expertise will be invaluable, even if conflict between the two is sure to arise..."

  ###Solar Flare###
  BLS_the_awakening:0 "The Awakening"
  BLS_the_awakening_desc:0 "At last, after so many millennia, she has been freed. The dawn approaches for Equus, and none shall escape the searing light of Her fury."
  BLS_first_follower:0 "The First Follower"
  BLS_first_follower_desc:0 "It is a strange and unnerving experience to awaken from slumber after thousands of years. To see odd ponies, descendants of the traitors, poking, prodding, and probing one's flesh even more. Yet, the Goddess has decided that one shall be spared. The one who made the "mistake" and overloaded the matrices that brought her back. She will die last, and in the meantime, she will serve well."
  BLS_atheists_everywhere:0 "Atheists Everywhere"
  BLS_atheists_everywhere_desc:0 "Untold ages have passed since the last of the generation that knew of Solar Flare died out. Now, society has progressed beyond its humble and dutiful reverence of alicorns as the deities they are. Ponies believe themselves masters of their fates, with their "knowledge" and "science" but they have fallen into infidelity instead. The Goddess shall correct this, and do so justly."
  BLS_thousand_year_nap:0 "The Millennia-long Slumber"
  BLS_thousand_year_nap_desc:0 "Although she was aware of her surroundings for the thousands of years she was sealed away, the Goddess has never seen the unbelievable advancement that the world has undergone while she was gone. Advanced applications of spells, electronics, refridgeration, among myriad other new things can prove overwhelming. Thankfully, there is a pony that can teach her all of it, whether she wants to or not."
  BLS_spare_nerds:0 "Spare the Smartest"
  BLS_spare_nerds_desc:0 "Unsurprisingly, with the sudden jump in mortality rate, many of the scientists and researchers in the universities have begun to flee before they become the next to meet Solar Flare, which is leading to a sudden brain drain. However, a number know Nebula Flare personally, and if she could convince them to swear loyalty with no requirement to worship the Goddess, then we could stem the worst of it."
  BLS_spare_jocks:0 "Spare the Strongest"
  BLS_spare_jocks_desc:0 "Untold throngs of ponies, more than ever lived in the domain of the Goddess thousands of years ago, toil in the factories and construction sites of the Directorate's designs. Since our savior's return, they have poured out in droves to fight agaisnt the few of us who currently serve her. However, she has decided that she will deal with this issue personally and correct their error."
  BLS_instruct_weak:0 "Instruct the Weak"
  BLS_instruct_weak_desc:0 "While those who were "convinced" by Nebula have stayed on, they are only simple, imperfect ponies who see no rhyme or reason to life. Because of their foolish worldview, they have cut themselves off from potential solutions to some of the greatest physical problems of their day. It is time she enlighten their empty minds."
  BLS_whelps_mission:0 "The Whelp's Mission"
  BLS_whelps_mission_desc:0 "Although Nebula Flare has proven her usefulness thus far, she has yet to convince the Goddess that she will follow orders completely, especially when her leash is slackened. Despite the Goddess's mercy through restoring her eyesight, she could still be rebellious. To prove her loyalty, she will be given the most important, but measurable task: the last High Priestess must be restored."
  BLS_first_task:0 "A Mighty First Task"
  BLS_first_task_desc:0 "Now that a number of workers have pledged themselves to Solar Flare, we can begin on recapturing the beauty of the former capital of the Goddess's empire. Thousands of years of erosion, weather patterns, and the effects of the final resurrection attempt have left it unrecognizable, but with these new bodies, the restoration will be accomplished."
  BLS_zealous_nerds:0 "Push Them to Zealotry"
  BLS_zealous_nerds_desc:0 "Bales primarily relied on a small, professional military comprised of perhaps a few thousand souls, with the rest being militia that would defend the nation if invaded by any of their neighbors. Only a few remained loyal, and they are also looking to desert. Yet the Goddess desires them to be the first of her new soldiers, and if it involves some coercion to stay, then so be it."
  BLS_correcting_primitives:0 "Correcting the Primitives"
  BLS_correcting_primitives_desc:0 "The Whelp has delivered a report of her findings, and after tracing the recorded history of Blazing Sheath's life - which was minimal - Nebula Flare has reached one conclusion. Blazing Sheath led the last defense of the Perditionem, and is somewhere in the same catacombs as the Goddess's resting place. Marechester will not appreciate the second visit."
  BLS_reface_land:0 "Reface the Land"
  BLS_reface_land_desc:0 "Now that the foundations have been set, we can begin to establish new blocs for the servants of the Goddess to reside and to toil. Great swathes of the outer-city will be reclaimed from nature so that we may construct great monuments to the Bright Day Star, and all those who see them will weep."
  BLS_mortals_dissent:0 "Mortals' One Dissent"
  BLS_mortals_dissent_desc:0 "As the difficulty of replacing ponies on short notice becomes apparent, the Goddess has decreed that she will provide mercy this one time to those who still fight against her will. All those in the military and militia must swear loyalty to her, though, lest her grace be revoked. It is doubtful many will be that foolish."
  BLS_fresh_blood:0 "Fresh Blood"
  BLS_fresh_blood_desc:0 "Having proved her mettle, Nebula Flare is the ideal candidate for working with the Goddess on her plans for punishing the world. As she is knowledgable on the modern world, she has experience where Blazing Sheath lacks, and her unique thinking will provide apt input for Solar Flare into the future."
  BLS_last_chance:0 "A Faithful's Last Chance"
  BLS_last_chance_desc:0 "As punishment for failure, Blazing Sheath had been left in torment, her soul stuck between this world and the afterlife. Now with her forgiveness, she has been provided the opportunity to show her competency to the Goddess again. Who else would be qualified to lead the Perditionem than her?"
  BLS_unearth_old_palace:0 "Unearth the Old Palace"
  BLS_unearth_old_palace_desc:0 "For part of our restructing of Bales, we will continue to excavate this "necropolis" that was discovered by the Directorate. In actuality, it is the buried city of Paelit, the Goddess's rightful home. What lays buried beneath remains to be seen, as the city was cleansed in the final war with the traitors. Only time will tell what secrets it holds."
  BLS_sun_guidance:0 "Guidance from the Sun"
  BLS_sun_guidance_desc:0 "It is laughable how the Balish leaders have neglected the state of their military so much. For even a small nation, the numbers and tactics employeed by the Technocracy were pathetic. If they were to be attacked by any real force, they would have collapsed within days. Thankfully, the Goddess knows war perfectly, and has deigned to lead our soldiers in glorious combat."
  BLS_salvage_magics:0 "Salvage New Magics"
  BLS_salvage_magics_desc:0 "Not everything that has been created by the vile Directorate is unfit for the faithful's use. While most of it is infidel refuse, the recent developments of using magic to containn miniature solar reactions could prove quite useful, especially if employed en masse. Perhaps there is some benefit to their foolishiness after all."
  BLS_proclaim_new_kingdom:0 "The Kingdom of Perdition"
  BLS_proclaim_new_kingdom_desc:0 "With our initial takeover from the Directorate complete, we can now reveal ourselves to the world. Every creature, every soul upon this wretched planet will learn of their determined fate, and they will tremble in fear of our Goddess and Her righteous judgement!"
  BLS_rebellious_masses:0 "The Rebellious Masses"
  BLS_rebellious_masses_desc:0 "Despite our complete control of their lives, the ponies of Bales and the surrounding states refuse to bow the knee to their Goddess. Insurrection has only continued to climb, which has endangered those who have followed their calling of submission. We must rectify this dire situation soon."
  BLS_last_guardian:0 "Reward the Last Guardian"
  BLS_last_guardian_desc:0 "Blazing Sheath was not the only pony involved in the final attempt to return Solar Flare to the world centuries ago. Were it not for Melting Point's meticulous journals in her last days in the ancient city, Nebula Flare would never have found the Goddess and initiated this world's judgement. Melting Point should be blessed in kind."
  BLS_new_works_master:0 "Appoint a New Master of Works"
  BLS_new_works_master_desc:0 "When the Goddess once ruled her empire before she was killed, she had had multiple ponies in positions of architectural projects, so that her servants could continue to edify her supremacy in works of art. Now that there is another, new empire for Her to rule, we must find somepony appropriate for the position, and there is one member of the Directorate that files the bill perfectly."
  
  ###Political###
  BLS_open_the_tombs:0 "Open the Tombs"
  BLS_open_the_tombs_desc:0 "In the beginning, during the original war against the traitors, many ponies pledged their lives to serve the Goddess's will. Great mausoleums were built as the war stretched on and casualties piled up. Now it is time to call upon these resting faithful again, so they may serve from the grave."
  BLS_the_twelve:0 "The Twelve"
  BLS_the_twelve_desc:0 "To fully finalize the Goddess's control, she needs appropriate servants to implement her will far and wide. While Nebula Flare and Blazing Sheath are a start, they are only two ponies, and have more meaningful tasks than what Solar Flare's inner circle would need to do. Proper followers, dedicated to the cause, or to promises of reward, are needed."
  BLS_influence_the_foalish:0 "Influence the Foolish"
  BLS_influence_the_foalish_desc:0 "Despite their desire for freedom and their steadfast adherence to "knowledge" and "freewill," the majority of the ponies fighting against the Goddess are nothing but mindless sheep. We have instructed more of our followers in how to effectively inspire, entice, or threaten these hapless layponies back to us, and it is now time to disperse them through the countryside. Their labor will not be in vain."
  BLS_leave_them_undead:0 "Leave Them Undead"
  BLS_leave_them_undead_desc:0 "Uncountable numbers of the ancient Perditionem or the warriors that pledged their lives to Solar Flare lay beneath the ground of Bales and other ancient sites. It is unrealistic to expect either the Goddess or her servants to bring every one back to this world, when a simple necromancy spell will give us a mindless servant to act as cannon fodder. More bodies are preferrable for the coming war."
  BLS_born_again:0 "Born Again"
  BLS_born_again_desc:0 "There are untold numbers of faithful servants and loyal warriers that perished in the first war withe the traitors, and it would be unmerciful of the Goddess to leave them buried or to return as mindless, rotting husks to be used as simple tools. It may be more taxing, but we must do our part to bring back every brother or sister to fight for Solar Flare in their greatest capacity."
  BLS_direct_to_grave:0 "Direct Them to the Grave"
  BLS_direct_to_grave_desc:0 "The vile Directorate encapsulates everything that Solar Flare is not. They are haughty, arrogant enough to believe they can discover every answer, when the answer to everything they seek is directly in front of them. As an embodiment of the spirit of rebellion that filled this world centuries ago, there is only one fate befitting them: Holy fire."
  BLS_promise_salvation:0 "Promise Them Salvation"
  BLS_promise_salvation_desc:0 "Although many will serve us, there are numerous others that are wary of us, and claim we want nothing more than to see the world burn around us. They are not entirely wrong, but we must get every body serving the Goddess, no matter what we must say or do. To that end, a small twisting of the Goddess's plans to be marketed as a saving grace is required. When they accept it, it will be too late to back out."
  BLS_promise_death:0 "Promise Them Death"
  BLS_promise_death_desc:0 "There is no need to hide what we desire: the destruction of this world and its sinful state is the greatest mission that any pony could be given. With nations all around us hostile, we can only ensure one thing that will befall our followers: a glorious death and fulfilling of the ultimate purpose of serving the Goddess. And that will all that need be said."
  BLS_apostolic_rebirth:0 "Rebirth of the Apostles"
  BLS_apostolic_rebirth_desc:0 "In the time of Solar Flare, four great servants of the Perditionem were appointed to head all aspects of the cult, underneath the High Priestess and of course, the Goddess herself. These zealous followers have been found amongst the graves, and it is time for them to restart their holy mission."
  BLS_no_distinction:0 "No Difference Between Life and Death"
  BLS_no_distinction_desc:0 "There is no meaning in the world outside of serving the Goddess, and whether one works in the factories, the mines, or the military, one has equal important to accomplish her goals. Even the soldiers are a vital piece of her plans, and death is not the final end to their service. Only when she is done will they meet the sweet embrace of the afterlife."
  BLS_temples_not_schools:0 "Temples Instead of Schools"
  BLS_temples_not_schools_desc:0 "While it is a despicable waste of time and resources, the universities and public education of the former Technocracy is incredibly robust, and at the moment, ponies have still been attending without much disruption. However, these could be put to use teaching far more important things than mathematics or physics: how to be a perfect servant for Solar Flare."
  BLS_slaves_of_the_mind:0 "Slaves of the Mind"
  BLS_slaves_of_the_mind_desc:0 "Until now, the laypony has been secure knowing that their thoughts, their hidden desires and sins, were their own, and nopony could see them. That was until the Goddess regained enough strength to see her servants' minds. Nothing can be hidden from her for long, and less can be done to resist her will if she directs on a pony."
  BLS_leave_to_priestesses:0 "Leave it to the Priestesses"
  BLS_leave_to_priestesses_desc:0 "With the amount of work that must still be accomplished, it is unwise to leave the Goddess with bearing the brunt of running the increasingly complex country that lays before her. As the role of High Priestess is still currently split between two ponies, it shall be left to them. They have more than enough time to handle it."
  BLS_control_the_traitors:0 "Direct Control"
  BLS_control_the_traitors_desc:0 "Although it appears almost insurmountable, the work that still lays undone to shape the nation into a singularly focused weapon to destroy the world is too difficult for anypony else other than Solar Flare. Nopony else is competent enough to see her vision to completetion, so she will forge the figurative blade herself. Woe to anypony who stands against her!"
  
  ###Priestesses###
  BLS_improvement_directive:0 "An Improvement Directive"
  BLS_improvement_directive_desc:0 "With Solar Flare pulling back from direct influence on the path of the country, that provides some leeway for a few policy changes. These will be designed around protecting the few scientists and teachers that are still left in [ROOT.GetName], as we need at least SOME ponies to advance our industry."
  BLS_zealous_directive:0 "A Zealous Directive"
  BLS_zealous_directive_desc:0 "Just because Solar Flare has given control of the nation over to the two High Priestesses, that does not mean we can sit idly by and let the essence of the Perditionem degrade from Nebula's influence. Enshrining further benefits for those who willingly serve the Goddess will keep us on the right track."
  BLS_find_reason_to_madness:0 "Find Reason to the Madness"
  BLS_find_reason_to_madness_desc:0 "Quantifying the insane devotion that Solar Flare inspires amongst her followers is next to impossible. To understand how religion has worked its way again into Bales, also unrealistic to comprehend. However, that doesn't mean we can't attempt to understand a few of the nuances in our new position."
  BLS_honor_guard_of_the_goddess:0 "Honor Guard of the Goddess"
  BLS_honor_guard_of_the_goddess_desc:0 "As the war with the world slowly approaches, we must ensure that the Goddess is protected from any potential threat to her rule. To that end, identifying the most zealous and loyal among the cult will be required and an elite force to strike hardest will be formed, where they will serve for eternity."
  BLS_new_paint:0 "New Coats of Paint"
  BLS_new_paint_desc:0 "Perhaps it was wishful thinking to figure out the twisted logic of the cult, but there are other distractions that can at least improve layponies while we are all still here. High Priestess Nebula and some of her old associates have spent countless hours improving civilian and military tech, and we are already reaping the benefits of their work."
  BLS_repurpose_resistance:0 "Repurpose the Resistance"
  BLS_repurpose_resistance_desc:0 "Although the atheistic resistance has been crushed, it is not unheard of to discover a new cell, or that an old one has restarted. They are woefully outmatched, but they provide an ample scapegoat. Embellishing some of their worst acts, or lying about their purpose could drive more ponies into a frenzy to serve the Goddess."
  BLS_scheme_to_succeed:0 "Disjointed Priorities"
  BLS_scheme_to_succeed_desc:0 "Since the role of leadership has fallen upon both High Priestesses, spats have not been unheard of over sometimes trivial things. As of late, the issue of where resources are allocated has become the hot-button topic. It remains to be seen how Nebula and Blazing will resolve the disagreement."
  BLS_who_needs_education:0 "Who Needs an Education?"
  BLS_who_needs_education_desc:0 "If our citizens will merely perish in glorious combat, and the ones who do not can taught on the job, why should we bother wasting time with academic pursuits? The ponies and costs will be better put to use elsewhere. Like a new statue to Solar Flare."
  BLS_return_to_ponke:0 "Returning to the Old Ways"
  BLS_return_to_ponke_desc:0 "Since Blazing has gained enough influence, she has attempted time and again to reduce the living standards of the laypony, to both motivate them to join the cult, and also to focus the resources elsewhere. This has not gone over well, to say the least, and Nebula has been grumbling about it. We can only hope it doesn't explode into something worse."
  BLS_science_always_wins:0 "Science Always Triumphs"
  BLS_science_always_wins_desc:0 "Through some clever manevuering, Nebula has gained some backing by the Perditionem and has begun to act more boldly on her less orthodox projects. This has garnered attention, but at this point, it seems there is little that anypony else can do about it. Science has endured, after all."
  BLS_heresy_never_wins:0 "Infidels Never Triumph"
  BLS_heresy_never_wins_desc:0 "As Blazing has regained more of her former supporters, she has centralized many of the decisions for the Perditionem to just her and her clique. Inductions into the cult have skyrocketed, and it appears that the threats to the Goddess have dwindled. Outside of Nebula and her ilk, that is."
  BLS_apply_magic_tech:0 "Apply Further Magical Technology"
  BLS_apply_magic_tech_desc:0 "There are numerous inefficiences and failings within the Perditionem that can be shored up with even basic usage of technology that's been in the Technocracy for decades. Dragging a few Luddites into the eleventh century would do everypony some - temporary - good."
  BLS_meet_basic_needs:0 "Meet Everypony's Needs"
  BLS_meet_basic_needs_desc:0 "It may be inevitable that the world will end, but there should still be some effort to preserving the lives of our citizens. Advancements in medical technology may not excite Blazing Sheath or others, but it will ead to stronger workers. And worshipers."
  BLS_primacy_of_mind:0 "Primacy of the Mind"
  BLS_primacy_of_mind_desc:0 "Ponies are not just mindless sacks of flesh that are meant to follow a leader, but they are creatures with minds and wills that can come up with ingenious solutions to problems. If we do not allow them some room to breathe, we will collapse upon ourselves and be overwhelmed by our enemies."
  BLS_primacy_of_soul:0 "Primacy of the Soul"
  BLS_primacy_of_soul_desc:0 "Everypony's duty is to serve without question the commands of the Goddess or her High Priestess. Freewill is but an illusion, crafted by apostates and infidels to encourage sin. We may not have the most advanced weapons, but our faith will carry us to everypony's end."
  BLS_expand_death_cults:0 "Expand the Perditionem"
  BLS_expand_death_cults_desc:0 "With the growing length of the Goddess's reign, ponies are starting to acclimate to her rule, and many more are showing interest in joining the Perditionem. If we drive recruitment even harder, we will have more than enough warm - or cold - bodies to serve the Goddess for eternity."
  BLS_prioritize_faithful:0 "Prioritize the Faithful"
  BLS_prioritize_faithful_desc:0 "Nebula Flare believes that Blazing is ignoring the heatlh of everypony. It is not the case. Simply put, the state of the layponies is of no concern to the blessed of Solar Flare. However, the state of our own must be tended to, lest any grow too weak or sick to serve her to their utmost."
  BLS_modern_as_can_be:0 "As Modern as Can Be"
  BLS_modern_as_can_be_desc:0 "Through enough hard work, Nebula has managed to wrangle most of the control of the Perditionem away from Blazing and now can direct some of its reform without interruption. There still are a few loose ends, namely how to rid the nation of Blazing permanently without inciting uproar. There are always ways to be found, though."
  BLS_faithful_as_can_be:0 "As Faithful as Can Be"
  BLS_faithful_as_can_be_desc:0 "At last, enough of the Perditionem has been swayed by Blazing Sheath to back her once again that any hope Nebula had of moderating the cult can be considered eliminated. And, with total control, comes finally ridding the final gasps of the infidels from the cult, as gruesomely as possible."
  BLS_purgatory_on_equus:0 "Purgatory on Equus"
  BLS_purgatory_on_equus_desc:0 "Bales has been reshaped into an image of what will be to come for the rest of Equus, and then the world. Ponies from far and near seen their fate, which will be an eternal existence of suffering for their sins, before ultimate destruction. Our faithful High Priestess will lead the charge into the mouth of our enemies, and return victorious!"
  
  ###Solar Flare###
  BLS_spare_weakest:0 "Weakest for Labor"
  BLS_spare_weakest_desc:0 "It is a reality that not everypony in the country can fight on the frontlines. Some are too old, young, or incapable to properly wield a weapon to attack our foes. That doesn't mean they are useless, however. If they were hoping the be spared from their comrades' fate, they are mistaken. They'll simply be used for another, easier purpose."
  BLS_weakest_for_fodder:0 "Use the Infirm as Fodder"
  BLS_weakest_for_fodder_desc:0 "It is true that not everypony in the nation can sesrve as proper soldiers to fight for the end of creation. Whether they are incompetent, too young, or too old, they have some reason for their incapability in battle. However, that doesn't mean they are spared. We'll simply use them as shields for our proper units, and leave them to their fate."
  BLS_show_suns_might:0 "Show the Sun's Might"
  BLS_show_suns_might_desc:0 "So far, the punishment for the infidels and apostates of the land have been doled out by the Perditionem. With Solar Flare assuming total control of the country, there are some who still doubt whether she is the goddess that she claims to be. A simple reminder, through exacting justice with her own hooves, should be ample reminder enough."
  BLS_institute_fear_of_failure:0 "Institute Fear of Failure"
  BLS_institute_fear_of_failure_desc:0 "One of the contributions to the Goddess's last defeat was the lack of retribution for failing to achieve her desired outcomes. Of course, part of this was due to Solar Flare's undead state, but the fact remains that ponies in the cult, and in the greater ruling apparatus have yet to understand the peril they are in if they fail Solar Flare. That will require correcting. Immediately."
  BLS_review_military:0 "Review the "Military""
  BLS_review_military_desc:0 "The heart of Bales's defense is the Ministry of Arcane Defenses, which also is the primary military department for the region. While they have a number of skilled leaders, they have remained, through it all, rather independent. Reports of infidelity have remained high. It is time that it has its reins tightened with a few new appointments that will inform the Goddess of any wrongdoing."
  BLS_mors_viva:0 "Mors Viva"
  BLS_mors_viva_desc:0 "The Goddess's power continues to grow at a rapid rate. Like all great leaders, sycophants and weak-minded fools who wish to be commanded continue to pour in as her mental manipulations expand across the country, and across the world. These mindless idiots will be perfect to sacrifice in war, and will suppliment our resurrected brethren perfectly."
  BLS_show_true_magic:0 "Show True Magic"
  BLS_show_true_magic_desc:0 "It is hard to believe that somepony reported to have fought a minor alicorn to a stop is considered powerful in this day and age. When did unicorns think that a simple time travel spell or flight spell was unobtainable? The mages of old learned those in their sleep. While it may be impossible to teach today's unicorns spells of yore, their spells' potency may be increased through empowering from the Goddess."
  BLS_everywhere_at_once:0 "Omniscience through Magic"
  BLS_everywhere_at_once_desc:0 "With the threat of rebellion still not squashed, it is time to use some of our mages and the Goddess herself to watch the populace. Across the ocean, in a nation called Marelandia, they use something called a telescreen to observe everypony. We will be much more effective, as a simple spell can create an omnipresent watcher, which can alert Solar Flare immediately of any wrongdoing, without any pony involved."
  BLS_destroy_knowledge:0 "Destroy All Knowledge"
  BLS_destroy_knowledge_desc:0 "One of the most effective ways for ponies to remain defiant of their superiors is if they feel they know more than them, or have access to unfiltered information. Books are the repository of that information and of the past, and therefore are a threat to the continued rule of the Goddess. Besides, with nopony able to read, it will give them more time to train for battle."
  BLS_favor_the_whelp:0 "Favor the Whelp"
  BLS_favor_the_whelp_desc:0 "Nebula Flare has proven to be both resourceful and compliant. Out of all the ponies that could have been the savior of the Goddess, she was undoubtedly the best, and has already been rewarded appropriately. However, there is even more that she could do if empowered by the Goddess. It is time to let the old guard retire, and yet young blood revitalize the Perditionem."
  BLS_favor_the_trusted:0 "Favor the Trusted"
  BLS_favor_the_trusted_desc:0 "Blazing Sheath has served the Goddess for eons, faithfully serving her sentence for failure and working with renewed effort when given a second chance. Her years before her death were filled with success, and she has proven herself to be a capable and trustworthy priestess of Solar Flare. It is time for the old guard to fortify the Perditionem from young blood's naivete."
  BLS_let_her_friends_toil:0 "Let the Whelp's Friends Toil"
  BLS_let_her_friends_toil_desc:0 "While the Directorate has been destroyed, not every single member was executed, like Nebula believed. In her wisdom, the Goddess has kept a few behind in the dungeons, as a final test for the loyalty of the young unicorn. Each were friends in one way or another to Nebula, and it is such a shame that she can only choose one to serve with her."
  BLS_let_the_whelp_play:0 "Let the Whelp Play"
  BLS_let_the_whelp_play_desc:0 "It is undeniable that Nebula has a spark of ingenuity. Despite the different decrees from Solar Flare, she has still found some ways to further her pet projects on the side, which were only discovered recently. These armored chariots appear most capable, and she should continue to be encouraged to spend time on this... godless research. Only this avenue, however."
  BLS_specialists_needed:0 "Specialists are Still Needed"
  BLS_specialists_needed_desc:0 "As some of our spies report, we are beginning to fall quickly behind the nations surrounding us, which is can be compensated for by the Goddess only for so long. If we are to succeed at punishing the world for its sin, we must admit that we need some ponies who are more liberal in their outlook. Otherwise the nation could crumble at the first war."
  BLS_they_will_die:0 "They. Will. Die."
  BLS_they_will_die_desc:0 "Although it is known that we are beginning to severely fall behind the rest of our neighbors, it is of no matter. Whether we have the latest matrix for our energy weapons or not, we can simply drown them all in more bodies than they could hope to stop. After all, they will all die one day, anyway, and what concern to us if it is sooner than later?"
  BLS_spare_one:0 "Spare One"
  BLS_spare_one_desc:0 "There are numerous ponies left from the Technocracy that have yet to be executed for their sins, but that does not mean that they are useless. The administrative headache has become overwhelming for a normal pony to handle, and the scientists - some from the Directorate - could prove useful in dealing with day-to-day tasks. They would probably serve well, too, as they would be grateful to live."
  BLS_flaming_sword:0 "A Flaming Sword"
  BLS_flaming_sword_desc:0 "Since her resurrection, at times Blazing's thoughts have drifted to her life thousands of years ago, and the family that she had to leave for her ministry as High Priestess. This has hampered her work at times, but she has requested a short time to investigate, which will be granted, so long as she puts the nonsense behind her afterwards. A servant cannot serve two masters, after all."
  BLS_whelp_proven:0 "The Whelp is Proven"
  BLS_whelp_proven_desc:0 "Like many things that she has been tasked with, Nebula has continued to prove her competence with every mission that Solar Flare has given her. Now that she has continued to reinforce the cult with new, conformed advancements, there is little else that the Goddess can hope for her to achieve. She will be rewarded immensely, and her position as sole High Priestess enshrined forever."
  BLS_the_failure_has_been_fixed:0 "The Failure has been Fixed"
  BLS_the_failure_has_been_fixed_desc:0 "With her past finally behind her, and her competency proven yet again to the Goddess, Blazing has become a shining example of the best the Perditionem can produce. While Nebula has been useful, there is no arguing a pony as confident and familiar with the cult will always be the better option for leadership. Forever will Blazing be heralded as sole High Priestess of the Solaris Perditionem!"
  BLS_hell_on_equus:0 "Hell on Equus"
  BLS_hell_on_equus_desc:0 "With the last of the needed preparations completed, Bales has been forged into a dagger, ready to be plunged into the throat of the world. The Goddess's strength lies behind it, and as we march into the depths of Tartarus, we will drag everypony to their realm of everlasting torture!"

  BLS_cauterize_the_west_desc:0 "There are numerous natural resources buried in the forests, hills, and mountains of the new western expanses of our realm. [CLDGetNameDefCap] and [NER.GetNameDef] were sitting upon unclaimed wealth that we can now use for our forges. Tasking our new slaves to toil in the mines for our benefit will further break their will for rebellion, too."
  BLS_executions_sake:0 "Execution for Execution's Sake"
  BLS_executions_sake_desc:0 "As the number of ponies in our prison camps skyrocket, we must set examples of them to the rest of the free populace the price of rebellion. While some of these prisoners were here when we conquered the surrounding territory, they were obviously sinners in their countries. Their deaths will be just as good as a rebel."
  BLS_use_undead_guards:0 "Use the Undead as Guards"
  BLS_use_undead_guards_desc:0 "A benefit of expanding our realm is the additional bodies that we gain more thralls that we can use for menial tasks that nopony in the Perditionem would want to do. While they are limited in what they can do, our undead troops are effective at basic instructions, such as guarding prison camps from would-be runners. The results are gruesome, but it means we get even more to use for the job."
  BLS_shatter_dreams:0 "Shatter Their Dreams"
  BLS_shatter_dreams_desc:0 "Ponies are fickle creatures, and frequently maintain hope in the most dire of circumstances. They are not invincible, however, and many layponies will break when they realize how they are doomed to fail at any undertaking. Rounding more up for labor camps will remind them all of who their new masters are."
  BLS_eternal_suffering:0 "Eternal Suffering"
  BLS_eternal_suffering_desc:0 "It is not enough that those who actively resist are punished for their wrongdoing. To keep the populace in fear, we must also torment them and keep them pacified when they are compliant. Every waking moment will be spent hoping and praying they are not chosen for interrogation or made an example, for it would be better if they were never born than endure our plans for them."
  BLS_ancient_retreat:0 "An Ancient Retreat"
  BLS_ancient_retreat_desc:0 "Solar Flare's ancient empire once stretched from Bales in its center to the middle of [CRY.GetNameDef] and the southern fringes of [EQS.GetNameDef]. At one point, it was the largest nation on the planet, and she and her sister lived like the royalty and goddesses they were. With our recent conquests, we have taken the region of one of their summer homes, and she now wishes to visit it. And use it for the war."

  BLS_more_guns_for_meat_grinder_desc:0 "As we have taken more territory from the infidels, we have come across new weapons' technology that could be quite useful. Since we mostly use our unending faithful for assaults, we should equip them with the best we have. That way they may last a few more minutes before perishing for our Goddess."
  BLS_localized_destruction:0 "Localized Weapons of Destruction"
  BLS_localized_destruction_desc:0 "Not all machinery is evil, and some of it can be quite useful. The great guns of the infidels, which are their modern-day catapaults, have proven how effective they are against us. It is now time we turn it agains them, and flatten their cities as retribution for their defiance."
  BLS_an_old_home:0 "An Old Home"
  BLS_an_old_home_desc:0 "For millennia, Solar Flare lay resting in an elaborate mausoleum constructed near the end of her epoch. That region lays empty now, but the vast underground complex could be used again for new purposes. Ones that could springboard our attacks north to the great reaches of [CRY.GetNameDef] or the yak clans."
  BLS_sisterhood_of_moon:0 "Sisterhood of the Vengeful Moon"
  BLS_sisterhood_of_moon_desc:0 "As our reach expands further across the world, our core territories have grown neglected due to limited administrative capacity of the Perditionem. To alleviate this, it has been proposed that a branch of the Perditionem be created, which could oversee its own region and recruit from its ranks while supporting our endeavors. An honorary cult in Solar Flare's sister's memory would be the perfect start."
  BLS_might_of_goddesses:0 "Might of the Goddess"
  BLS_might_of_goddesses_desc:0 "Solar Flare continues to bless our soldiers as they move deeper into enemy territory. The blood of champions now flows through their veins, and her courage and power courses through every inch of their body. They will be unstoppable warriors of her hoof, to exact revenge upon the world!"
  BLS_suicidal_fervor:0 "Suicidal Fervor"
  BLS_suicidal_fervor_desc:0 "With victory after victory, our soldiers believe themselves unstoppable in enacting the revenge of Solar Flare upon the sinful world. Their weapons are like hot steel slicing through flesh and bone to drive deep into the enemy's chest. Losses mean nothing to our faithful warriors as they fulfill the will of the Goddess!"
  BLS_flame_for_flame_goddess:0 "Flames for the Flame Goddess"
  BLS_flame_for_flame_goddess_desc:0 "On the home front, ponies are still coming in droves, through their own volition, or our compulsion, to fight for the Goddess and die for her. Their eagerness will be told until the end of the time, and when they are ready, they will be used to slice off the head of the enemy, and leave the world a globe of ash!"
  BLS_sisterhood_of_sun:0 "Sisterhood of the Broken Sun"
  BLS_sisterhood_of_sun_desc:0 "While our reach continues to expand across the globe, we are finding ourselves strained with maintaining proper systems in our home territories. To that end, we will split some of the Perditionem into a sister cult, dedicated to Solar Flare, to lead our outlying regions, to keep the peace, and supplement our forces."
  BLS_turn_machines_against_them:0 "Turn Their Machines Against Them"
  BLS_turn_machines_against_them_desc:0 "Our enemies believe that they are safe in their armored chariots. They are not entirely wrong, as their tank divisions have lain waste to some of our most skilled warriors. But they forget we have something they never consider: magic. It is only time before the very tools they use will betray them into our hooves."
  BLS_choking_skies:0 "Choking the Skies"
  BLS_choking_skies_desc:0 "While the enemy may have more experience in air combat than we do, there is something they lack: the sheer number of bodies we can throw at both producing planes and flying them. As the days continue, we will blot the skies with our swarms, laying waste to every airfield, house, and town in sight, and their only response will be to cower in fear!"
  BLS_the_new_heart:0 "The New Heart"
  BLS_the_new_heart_desc:0 "[3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has apparently has been the heart of ponykind for generations. It is amusing to think that at one time, the mountain was seen as worthless.

  BLS_final_secrets:0 "Unearth the Final Secrets"
  BLS_final_secrets_desc:0 "Since Solar Flare has returned, the excavation of the ancient library of Balesh'ka Serath has been largely left alone, aside from what has been done to prepare for further digs into the deepest parts of the city. However, the repository of all knowledge of the traitors lie within, and some of that must include records of the first sin. Selena's resting place must be found."
  BLS_the_search:0 "The Search"
  BLS_the_search_desc:0 "With their task assigned, Nebula Flare and Blazing Sheath have been the greatest of tasks to accomplish. The tomes of the library hold uncountable amounts of knowledge, and it will be up to them to sift through it to find the evidence that is needed to locate Selena's remains. If they have to tear apart the entire library, then so be it, for failure will not be tolerated."
  BLS_through_the_archives:0 "Dig Through the Archives"
  BLS_through_the_archives_desc:0 "While we have found a few references here and there to the great rebellion that damned this world to its fate, there is nothing yet concrete in regards to old locations. Across the vast former empire that the Goddess once controlled, the burial grounds could be anywhere, and hidden beneath who knows how many layers of dirt. Until we find an exact determiniation, then it is foolish to wander above-ground for the site."
  BLS_ancient_trail:0 "Follow the Ancient Trail"
  BLS_ancient_trail_desc:0 "As we have found a few clues to what the rebels did with Selena, Blazing has taken upon herself to head in the most likely direction of the referenced site, "the Pool of Ascension." While the landscape has changed over the millennia, querying an ancient alicorn with an impressive memory can give many hints, and it should not take long to discover where the pool now rests."
  BLS_the_report:0 "The Report"
  BLS_the_report_desc:0 "It is done. We can now plan our expedition to the Pool of Ascension, so it is only a matter of time before we find the remains of Selena, and then report to Solar Flare. What she has planned for them is unknown, but it is not our place to question the Goddess and her desires. We can only hope that things do not go awry."
  
  ###Military###
  BLS_cleanse_army:0 "Cleanse the Armed Forces"
  BLS_cleanse_army_desc:0 "Far too many ponies in Bales's military have yet to swear their loyalty to the Goddess. Additionally, there are numerous that are obviously paying lip service to her but never intend to follow her to death. These infidels and hypocrites have no place in the weapon that Solar Flare intends to forge, and it is time we burn them like the chaff they are."
  BLS_more_examples:0 "Set More Examples"
  BLS_more_examples_desc:0 "There are still entire divisions that refuse to listen to our orders and obey the Goddess without question. A few of them are stationed within city of Bales's vicinity, so it is time they are used as a showpiece for what the others will face if they do not get in line. A personal demonstration is in order."
  BLS_perditious_legion:0 "Legionnaires of Perdition"
  BLS_perditious_legion_desc:0 "As we begin to restructure the military to that of the Goddess's former empire, we will reimplement the legionnary system, where squads are placed under command of our unquestioningly loyal cultists, who will ensure that they fight until the death. Every. Last. One."
  BLS_marvelous_destruction:0 "Marvelous Destruction"
  BLS_marvelous_destruction_desc:0 "Wonderful advances in warfare have been developed since Solar Flare was first stopped. At one time, ballistae and catapaults were the pinnacle of long-range, devastating weaponry, but now they would be destroyed before we could even get close to setting them up. These artillery cannons that have replaced them are beautiful to behold, and should be improved further now that we have use for them."
  BLS_dominate_fears:0 "Dominate Their Fears"
  BLS_dominate_fears_desc:0 "Despite all attempts, there are still those that resist Solar Flare's authority in the military. It is of no concern, however, as we need no longer even directly risk ourselves in stamping out their rebellion. As the Goddess has recovered, more of her power has returned, and she has a few new surprises for these comrades in arms. Or, rather, former comrades."
  BLS_holy_death:0 "Holy Tools of Death"
  BLS_holy_death_desc:0 "Mundane weapons are still a mainstay of any army, especially one that relies on less than dependable earth ponies or pegasi. While the swords and spears of yore are mere ceremony, their role has not been phased out. Now, rifles and pistols replace them, and they are much more effective at the task. We should iterate upon what we see to keep our infantry as deadly as possible."
  BLS_new_ideas:0 "Adopt Some New Ideas"
  BLS_new_ideas_desc:0 "The former minds of Bales have spent countless hours toiling over data sheets and theorizing on any number of topics. While they might have developed a few new toys, they never put much theory pondering into the ideas behind warfare, save for a few near the end. Perhaps these brave few souls have discovered something of worth."
  BLS_valueless_minions:0 "Valueless Minions"
  BLS_valueless_minions_desc:0 "In the eons since the last of the Perditionem was eliminated, commanders and generals have begun to see their soldiers as ponies, as something that should be spared as much as they can. It is a preposterous idea, as they are nothing more than tools to be thrown away if they are destroyed. What is one of their lives compared to the Goddess's?"
  BLS_infiltrate_lines:0 "Infiltrate Their Lines"
  BLS_infiltrate_lines_desc:0 "At one time, we believed that the battle lines that formed when two armies clashed was the most important and unstoppable part of any military operation. Occasionally, flanking manevuers would be performed to rout an enemy. There are still concrete lines today, but new tactics imply that special ponies trained for slipping behind them can do more damage than any direct confrontation could perform. We should adopt this immediately."
  BLS_break_them:0 "Whip Them Until They Break"
  BLS_break_them_desc:0 "The recruits that we have taken from the cities in the nation have no concept of military structure. Strict adherence to a commander's orders are paramount, for if they are not followed, then the entire formation could break, and far more disastrous consequences could occur. These fools have already disobeyed constantly, and it is time to take punitive measures to ensure compliance, whether they like it or not."
  BLS_autonomous_legions:0 "Autonomous Legions"
  BLS_autonomous_legions_desc:0 "Another tenet of modern warfare appears to be more autonomous, free-acting groups of soldiers that do not need to be provided constant orders for success. While this is against the grain of our former strategies, it has apparently proven effective to those who implemented it. Our faithful will have more difficulty maintainig order, but it's necessary for success."
  BLS_worthless_unless_dead:0 "Worthless Until They Die"
  BLS_worthless_unless_dead_desc:0 "There are always ponies who can replace those we lose in battle. Although some might be against our compulsorary service, it provides a constant stream of new recruits that can be used to shore up our gaps. Besides, if they're breathing, they can be used to assault an enemy, and when they're dead, they can be used for fueling fires."
  BLS_nothing_without_goddess:0 "Without the Goddess We Are Nothing"
  BLS_nothing_without_goddess_desc:0 "It is only through Solar Flare, our vengeful Goddess, that we have the hope to succeed in our military operations. Were it not for her, we would be floundering without purpose. May her eternal fury fill us with strength as we smite down her enemies!"
  
  BLS_god_killers:0 "Learn from the Goddess Killers"
  BLS_god_killers_desc:0 "The pegasi believe themselves the superior species of Creation simply because they can fly and the others cannot. Little do they know they are less than dirt for their instigation of the rebellion against our Goddess, and for even initially slaying her and preventing her return. However, they have helped pioneer this new concept of mechanized arial combat, and we should learn from them, no matter how distasteful that is."
  BLS_modernity_required:0 "Modernity is Required"
  BLS_modernity_required_desc:0 "The days of brawls in the air between pegasi in acrobatic combat are long gone. Although specially trained pegasi commandos are still a staple of modern armies, they have been replaced, thankfully, by the fighter plane, which can easily outrun all but the fastest ponies and outmanevuer them in a heartbeat. We have to improve our own stock if we are to hope to keep our offensives up."
  BLS_unique_weapon:0 "A Unique Weapon"
  BLS_unique_weapon_desc:0 "We have discovered some papers buried away in some scientit's files references to a technology that was once worked on here when the nation was part of the false alicorn, Daybreaker's, empire. A wonderful substance, powerful as the strongest fire mages, that could ignite swaths of land from safe distances. This could easily replace many combat mages on the frontline if we are able to equip our planes with proper delivery mechanisms."
  BLS_scrape_minds:0 "Scrape Their Minds"
  BLS_scrape_minds_desc:0 "Bales was a home to the various races of ponies in an almost equal measure, despite the seeming class divide. The Directorate employed numerous, vile pegasi, frequently in the air divisions of their research wings. These descendants of the traitors are still rotting in our dungeons, and it's time we glean everything we can from them. They don't have to survive the procedure, either."
  BLS_punishing_skies:0 "Punishment from the Skies"
  BLS_punishing_skies_desc:0 "While we may be able to rain absolute devastation on our enemies already, synergizing it with waves upon waves of a class of fighter called dive bombers could tip scales even further in our favor. Laden with deadly napalm, these shall completely lay waste to any resistance and deliver every infidels' fate without trial."
  BLS_rule_skies:0 "Rule the Skies"
  BLS_rule_skies_desc:0 "From the combat reports we have found as case studies for the theorists of Bales, we can clearly see that those who do not wrest the air from their enemies will be slowed, stalled, or even pushed back by a numerically inferior force. The only way we can hope to achieve our goals are if we manage to maintain our own superiority through advanced fighters. Only then can we accomplish our goal."
  BLS_dominate_earth:0 "Dominate the Earth"
  BLS_dominate_earth_desc:0 "These metal frames that fly through the air are remarkable, as they can be outfitted with a wide variety of deadly tools. Yet their most useful configuration is when they are equipped with nothing but weapons to assure the annihilation of any enemies we see on the ground. Our swarms of fighters shall prey on them like locusts to a field!"
  BLS_flying_graves:0 "Flying Graves"
  BLS_flying_graves_desc:0 "After a series of accidents, it is clear that not only can fighters destroy with weapons, but they can be the weapon themselves. These pilots are now lilving on borrowed time, for the moment they step into their cockpit, they are destined to one day become a fireball of glory for our Goddess, and take with them the hopes and dreams of their foes."
  BLS_carpeted_fury:0 "Carpets of Fury"
  BLS_carpeted_fury_desc:0 "Through additional tinkering and modification, we have further expanded the destructive cabilities of our dive bombers with larger bays to hold their payloads. Every run shall unleash torrents of explosives and napalm that will blanket any location in cleansing fire. Ponies caught in the blasts will feel the wrath of our Goddess called upon them for their sins!"
  BLS_not_pointless:0 "Not As Pointless After All"
  BLS_not_pointless_desc:0 "With the rest of their knowledge expended, the concept of anything more useful coming from the pegasi was unthinkable, yet the few who became pilots have proven that they are another breed in the air compared to unicorns or earth ponies. Perhaps there is some merit in letting them remain the masters of the air, so long as they impart their skills and experience to us."
  BLS_screaming_eagles:0 "Screaming Eagles"
  BLS_screaming_eagles_desc:0 "New, revoluntionary developments have recently been uncovered in the deepest sections of Bales' studies. Apparently, they had been working on a forced-air engine that would drive any plane faster than even the speed of sound, something completley unheard of in the Goddess's time. These new models will be our shining stars, soaring through the skies like pegasi and striking as hard as the most powerful mage to seal our enemies' doom!"
  BLS_warriors_of_heaven:0 "Warriors of Heaven"
  BLS_warriors_of_heaven_desc:0 "Despite our humble origins, we have built a force for the skies that rivals that of any of the infidels. Empowered by their faith to the Goddess, our pilots will strike fear into the sinful, for they stand as guardians of purity and judgement. May their strikes be swift and their aims true as they sacrifice themselves for our benefit!"
  
  BLS_worlds_shores:0 "Shores of the World"
  BLS_worlds_shores_desc:0 "Even at the height of her reign, Solar Flare barely had any territory along the coastline of this vast continent. Settlements of poines extended far and wide, but her reach was finite. To know that [EQS.GetNameDef] once spanned from one side to the other is astonishing. There surely must be much naval knowledge we can learn from as we take their land for us."
  BLS_cultist_sailors:0 "The Perditionem Rules the Waves"
  BLS_cultist_sailors_desc:0 "Many of our enemies' former vessels were in ports when we seized their territory, and they now lie dormant and empty, waiting for the perfect opportunity to be used again. As we have yet to acquire enough facilities to begin our own production, we will oblige them, and start our vast armada to sow terror into the hearts of our foes with these!"
  BLS_take_imperial_dockyards:0 "Sieze Imperial Dockyards"
  BLS_take_imperial_dockyards_desc:0 "Both megalopolises of [EQS.GetNameDef] are massive manufactories in their own right. As the heart of the Imperial Navy, they provided new ships and supplies for the various fleets that patrolled [EQS.GetAdjective] waters. These giant dockyards have yet to be placed under our direction, and it is time that we rectify that, and rectify it quickly."
  BLS_specialize_followers:0 "Specialize Our Followers"
  BLS_specialize_followers_desc:0 "As we improve our military, it has become apparent that there will be times when a generalist soldier will struggle to accomplish their goals in a reasonable fashion. As much as it isn't an excuse for slothfulness on their part, if we were to train elite members to fight in the most extreme conditions, it could improve our effectiveness exponentially."
  BLS_infidels_gift:0 "Gifts from the Infidels"
  BLS_infidels_gift_desc:0 "As we spread our influence further across the continent, we have accrued a wealth of different naval doctrine tactics that we can use to quickly bolster our needed armadas for the future. On top of that, the number of scuttled ships that our enemies have left behind provides a starting resource base to kickstart our own flets. We can only thank them for their contributions to others' doom."
  BLS_mosquito_destroyers:0 "Mosquitos on the Giants"
  BLS_mosquito_destroyers_desc:0 "Numerous navies across the world rely on large, slow, and cumbersome heavy warships to wrest dominance on the seas. While their guns are certainly fiercesome, they are nearly incapable of landing hits on sthe smallest vessels. We shall show our enemies that they need to worry about scratches more than deep wounds, for even a giant will fall if enough cut at him."
  BLS_ferrying_judgement:0 "Ferrying Judgement"
  BLS_ferrying_judgement_desc:0 "There is a simple problem that we currently face with our plans for spreading our punishment across the world: we have no ways to properly carry our soldiers across the waters. Even the undead will flounder if they have to walk across the ocean floor, so this must be rectified before we hope to enact retribution on the griffons or zebras."
  BLS_chosen_chosen:0 "Chosen of the Chosen"
  BLS_chosen_chosen_desc:0 "There are some ponies within our specialization programs that clearly are blessed with marshal acumen above those of the others. While they are not super-soldiers like some nations have hoped, they should be nurtured and trained to become the most dangerous of our faithful troops. If they must be dispatched, then the enemy will know that their fate is sealed."

  BLS_hoof_extension_desc:0 "Although we must rely on our lighter ships to be the heaviest hitters of our navy and swarm our enemies into submission, the venerable heavy ship is still required to pummel the coasts or be the lynchpin of an operation. To that end, we will construct the largest floating fortresses the world has seen, so that the Goddess can swat her enemies wherever they lurk!"
  BLS_killer_infection:0 "Infection of the Goddess Killers"
  BLS_killer_infection_desc:0 "It seems that the pegasi will wriggle their way into any branch of military operations, as many navies across the world have adopted the concept of aircraft carriers. These mobile cities, filled to the brim with planes, have proven effective time and again, and we must reluctantly learn from it, even if it means acknowledging a useful idea from pegasi."
  BLS_untouchable_armadas:0 "Untouchable Armadas"
  BLS_untouchable_armadas_desc:0 "Through careful processes, our ships will become the envy of the world's.

  BLS_swarm_the_seas_desc:0 "With Equus, we have a massive potential for producing unending tides of vessels to overwhelm any navy's hope of survival.

  BLS_boiling_sea_desc:0 "Our fury has forged our formerly empty navy into one of the greatest fighting forces ever seen in history. Our fearless captains and admirals will lead our vessels into the gates of Tartarus, and unleash the fires of perdition wherever they go. The enemies of the Goddess will cower in fear, and their pleas for mercy will only be answered with death!"

  BLS_abolish_work_week:0 "Abolish the Work Week"
  BLS_abolish_work_week_desc:0 "In the time of the Goddess, there were the fortunate upper class, and then all other laborers had one role: to labor! The ponies since then have grown soft and petulant. Why does a factory worker need days of rest? They have hours before their next shift. That is more than enough than the five minutes most slaves had thousands of years ago."
  BLS_ungrateful_slaves:0 "Ungrateful Slaves"
  BLS_ungrateful_slaves_desc:0 "The masses of workers that have toiled in Bales have seen fit that the recent changes are to be condemned. They believe they have the right - the right! - to protest the Goddess's wisdom on matters such as these. Swarms of ponies have flooded the central streets of Bales and other cities, demanding a reverse of course. If only they knew what dangerous ground they were treading."
  BLS_no_more_workshops:0 "No Mere Workshops"
  BLS_no_more_workshops_desc:0 "Apparently, within the last century, a phenomenon known as the Industrial Revolution swept across all of Equus as well as portions of the continents of the griffons and of the zebras. What the greatest artisans of Solar Flare's hoped to achieve in a lifetime can now be produced in a matter of hours with the machinery available in these factories. It is truly a marvelous time to destroy the world."

  BLS_mandatory_families_desc:0 "It has become apparant that not only is this nation corrupt in the mind, it is corrupt in the heart. Although this idea of a "population pyramid" is rather foreign, it is clear that not enough young mares are having foals to dedicate to the Goddess. If they will not willingly pair with stallions, then they shall be motivated in other ways. Magic can easily control the feelings of the heart, too."

  BLS_excavate_ancient_city_desc:0 "While the Directorate did start the uncovering of its deepest roots, they only scratched the surface through unveiling the library. In truth, an entire metropolis lies beneath the soil in Bales. Although this was known, the Directorate had no idea the valuables they had yet to find in the ancient Balesh'ka Serath. With our new resources, we can recover much of what was lost when the final conflict with the traitors occurred."
  BLS_unwilling_sacrifices:0 "Unwilling Sacrifices"
  BLS_unwilling_sacrifices_desc:0 "Let it not be said that the Goddess was merciless to those that despise her the most. Every soul that has fought against her in these last few weeks have been given chances to repent and return to their duties, but they have summarily grown more rebellious. If they will not serve in the factories, then they will serve as examples to any others questioning their loyalties."
  BLS_only_worship_breaks:0 "The Only Breaks are Worship Breaks"
  BLS_only_worship_breaks_desc:0 "Since we have introduced the continuous work cycles, ponies have slowly been collapsing from exhaustion from the sheer amount of time they spend toiling in our manufactories. Although they can always be replaced, it takes time to train said replacement. Therefore, it is in the best interest to slacken the demands slightly, by allotting an hour's worship break each day for them. They should be grateful."
  BLS_amazing_tools:0 "Astounding Tools of Industry"
  BLS_amazing_tools_desc:0 "There are always seems to be a new discovery for the Goddess or her followers in how ponies have ingeniously adapted to a world without proper order and structure in their lives.

  BLS_goddess_quotas:0 "Goddess-Ordained Quotas"
  BLS_goddess_quotas_desc:0 "With the marvels of modern technology, it is a shame that there is not more production of the important things for a nation of war. Many industries have sprung up around the concept of meeting only the needs of a civilian, rather than the military. Due to this, our stockpiles are worringly low in many areas ahead of our future wars. A few heavy "suggestions" should get them on the right track."
  BLS_establish_ley_line:0 "Establish Ley Line Indutries"
  BLS_establish_ley_line_desc:0 "This region was once the heartlands of the Goddess's empire, and it was a land flowing with milk, honey, and an abundance of natural resources. While there is still some evidence of our ancient mineshafts in the hills in the north, much of what could be extracted has been lost, and we must build from scratch. We shall facilitate it with a new company that will follow our every word on when and where to dig, so that we can reasp the most benefits."

  BLS_digging_depths_desc:0 "There are numerous sections around the city of Bales that we could begin to burrow into, but the Directorate has already saved us some of the work through uncovering the ancient library. Some may decry using explosives and other heavy tools in a residential location, but it is none of our concern if there are casualties."
  BLS_correct_organizers:0 "Correct the Organizers"
  BLS_correct_organizers_desc:0 "Despite the numerous ponies that have taken to the streets, they have been headed only by a couple of dozen ponies at most, from various labor unions across the nation. This is an excellent opportunity to use them as the best witnesses for Solar Flare's mercy. For if they refuse our generous offer of a few concessions in exchange for peace, they can spread the word to their followers. They're dead, if they don't."
  BLS_hunt_organizers:0 "Hunt Down the Organizers"
  BLS_hunt_organizers_desc:0 "As it is only a small number of ponies who have organized the unrest of the workers, it should be simple enough to dispatch some of our best followers and elminate them before they are able to cause much more issue. Their fate was sealed the moment they thought they could resist the power of the Goddess."
  BLS_instruments_of_punishment:0 "Instruments of Punishment"
  BLS_instruments_of_punishment_desc:0 "With the production capacity that our great factories can handle, it is a wonder that we have not dedicated everything to the tools that are the most needed. While many citizens may cry for fresh clothing, new utensils, or a million other inane things, we should be streamlining and focusing only on what will achieve us success. A few starving mouths is nothing compared to hundreds of new guns."
  BLS_instruments_of_desire:0 "Instruments of Desire"
  BLS_instruments_of_desire_desc:0 "As we have an inordinate amount of production capacity, it is no wonder that some of it was dedicated to meeting the wants of our citizens, albeit, inefficiently. Unfortunately, the screams and bleating of the layponies for their nicities is something that is not easily silenced. If we keep at least the bare minimum happy, it will be safer in the long run."
  BLS_ground_level:0 "Ground Level"
  BLS_ground_level_desc:0 "After weeks of digging, at elast a dozen traps prepared as the last battle took place, and one or two tunnel cave-ins, we have finally reached the bottom level of Balesh'ka Serath. Through the magics that wiped it from the map, it has been preserved within a massive cavern underneath modern Bales. It is time we begin to expand out to see what we find."
  BLS_pardon_laborers:0 "Pardon the Laborers"
  BLS_pardon_laborers_desc:0 "Many of the ponies that protested against our regime were merely caught up in the herd mentality that all crowds eventually develop. Others were deceived by the lies of the organizers, who said that the Goddess did not care about them at all. These misguided fools must be exonerated for their error. However, the punishment will be thrice as severe if they are arrested again."
  BLS_string_up_layponies:0 "String Up the Laborers"
  BLS_string_up_layponies_desc:0 "Multitudes were deceived by the protest organizers or caught up in the mania of the swarms that descended up on Bales, but that does not matter. They believed themselves the determiners of their fates, and that the Goddess was infringing upon so-called "Pony Rights." That idea alone is preposterous, and therefore, they are all guilty for their crimes. Ignorance is no excuse."
  BLS_melt_unneeded_luxuries:0 "Melt Down Unneeded Luxueries"
  BLS_melt_unneeded_luxuries_desc:0 "There are untold numbers of luxuries that the citizens of Bales still enjoy, that could be put to far greater use in our factories. Does anypony really need a radio device? The metals in that alone could create the receiver of new rifle instead. It is time we confiscated all those extraneous items that could be repurposed."
  BLS_forges_for_future:0 "Additional Forges for the Future"
  BLS_forges_for_future_desc:0 "To facilitate greater capacity for both the military and for the needy citizens, we shall grant them the freedom to add a few private enterprises to mostly handle the the asks of the everyday pony. However, for this to be allowed, they must provide us some of their products, or maintain a portion of production for weapons, which can then be shipped to our soldiers where needed."
  BLS_refine_extraction:0 "Refine the Extraction Process"
  BLS_refine_extraction_desc:0 "The old mining companies of Bales were completely ignorant of the techniques that they could have used to improve their extraction rates of the mines that were still active. Some of the greatest metallurgists in the world once lived in the Goddess's empire, and while they are gone, their knowledge still remains with her. Soon we will be filled to the brim with the raw resources we need."
  BLS_thorough_digging:0 "Thorough and Complete"
  BLS_thorough_digging_desc:0 "There is an inordinate amount of relics buried in the necropolis, and over time some of the caverns have collapsed to bury them from us. While the construction of the city is incredibly durable, time is not kind to anything and even slightly careless work may lead to catastrophics losses. It is better we don't risk losing anything more than go through it speedily."
  BLS_quick_digging:0 "Quick and Precise"
  BLS_quick_digging_desc:0 "The construction of Balesh'ka Serath is incredibly hardy, and for the most part, time has not seemed to wear it down too much. Although we shouldn't be completely haphazard in our approach, some carelessness is acceptable within reason. Any artifacts that we may lose will be replaced once we reach our prize of the old palace of the Goddess."
  BLS_end_chaos:0 "An End to the Chaos"
  BLS_end_chaos_desc:0 "With the last of the workers rounded up an dealt with, it is now time to assess the economic damage to the nation and plot a way forward. Many ponies lost their lives in some of the worst of the rioting, and it is only appropriate that we use the lessons learned here to prevent another uprising from happening related to the economy."
  BLS_work_to_bone:0 "Work Them to the Bone"
  BLS_work_to_bone_desc:0 "The idea that workers have any right to breaks in their labor is patently ridiculous. Anypony not found serving the Goddess with their every waking breath is at risk of falling into apostasy, or is in fact a hypocritical infidel that never followed her to begin with. Therefore, so long as they are working consistently, they will be of no threat to us, and will produce what is needed for the nation."
  BLS_slaves_for_fire:0 "More Slaves for the Fires"
  BLS_slaves_for_fire_desc:0 "As our industry continues to expand, most factory owners and businessponies that haven't fled have been trying to hire ponies with contracts for payment. Unsurprisingly, few are willing to trade away all their free time for labor, with little to show for it as we dictate. It is of no matter, however, as we can simply take them by force to toil for us. It is the solution we should have done from the start."
  BLS_ultimate_efficiency:0 "Ultimate Efficiency"
  BLS_ultimate_efficiency_desc:0 "Through combining the knowledge of the advanced refining and extracting processes of Bales with our own mages' magical talent, we can reduce the amount of waste that we create while we dig through the earth for more resources. Through it, the bounties of the world will make us the most powerful weapons that ponies can imagine!"
  BLS_proper_protocol:0 "Properly Protect the Artifacts"
  BLS_proper_protocol_desc:0 "As part of our intricate excavation of the ancient necropolis, we are uncovering hundreds of relics and artifacts. Sometimes they are nothing but simple wares, but occasionally they include some of the old spell technology used in Balesh'ka Serath. All of these must be preserved and analyzed for us to get a proper benefit from the old city."
  BLS_rewards_for_labor:0 "Rewards for Labor"
  BLS_rewards_for_labor_desc:0 "As the old palace of Solar Flare is cleared, Nebula has taken it upon herself to document some of the new rooms. There are hundreds that have yet to be uncovered, and as of late she has spent more time underground than in fresh air. If she finds something of importance, hopefully it will at least be useful for all the time spent there."
  BLS_ignore_warnings:0 "Ignore the Warning Signs"
  BLS_ignore_warnings_desc:0 "A few ponies have raised concerns that the newest tunnels and cleared sites appear more unstable than before. Additionally, some minor damage has been inflicted on a few of the buildings from hasty workers. However, there are a number of promising avenues we can still take, and throwing a few more ponies at a problem will never hurt anything, even if they're not well-trained."
  BLS_full_workforce:0 "Full Workforce Mobilization"
  BLS_full_workforce_desc:0 "If we do not have a functioning economy, then whether we have swarms of troops or only a few dozen, they will be effectively the same. Although some within the Perditionem believe that forcing so many to toil in our factories will negatively affect our military, we must have the production base to supply them all their needs, even it means we feel the pinch on conscription numbers."
  BLS_last_freeponies:0 "The Last Freeponies"
  BLS_last_freeponies_desc:0 "Through all our efforts of placing more ponies in the workforce, there have been a number of scientists who have, until this moment, evaded notice while they continued to work for their vaunted "knowledge." Since they have been spared so far, Nebula has begun to agitate more to let them remain free and work for us. It is agreeable, so long as they concede to some demands."
  BLS_full_flexibility:0 "Full Economic Flexibility"
  BLS_full_flexibility_desc:0 "Through the additional forges that have been constructed, as well as the knowledge of resourceful recycling from our ancient mages, our economy can flip to a different requirement in short notice. Whether the workers grumble about sudden shifts is irrelevant if we can respond to any situation at a moment's notice."
  BLS_slow_and_steady:0 "Slow and Steady"
  BLS_slow_and_steady_desc:0 "By now, the excavation teams have gone well past their intended timeframes for uncovering the old palace, but they have made up for it by the wealth of relics that they have preserved with their meticulous attention to preserving the everything. As much as the Goddess is growing impatient, we must encourage this behavior if we want everything we can from the city."
  BLS_pick_up_pace:0 "Picking Up the Pace"
  BLS_pick_up_pace_desc:0 "As the excavation teams have dawdled well past their allotted dates of delivering their promises, their excuses for being careful are beginning to grate further upon everypony involved with the digsite. Although even Nebula has cautioned for care with this, especially as we go through the old palace, the Goddess has ordered that the tempo increase. It's a strong building. It can handle a few explosives."
  BLS_respect_age:0 "Respect the Age"
  BLS_respect_age_desc:0 "As much as we've been hasty so far in our excavation, now that we have finally reached the palace, it is best if we slow down our efforts and perform the rest of the operation more surgically. While we still don't know what we are supposed to find, the Goddess has implied it's important. We don't want an accident to destroy it, do we?"
  BLS_hasty_scouting:0 "A Rapid Search"
  BLS_hasty_scouting_desc:0 "We are under much pressure to deliver whatever the Goddess wants so dearly in the old palace of Balesh'ka Serath. At this point, there is some question to the remaining structural integrity of the palace, and there is a good chance it could partly collapse if we do much more to it. Still, the threat of punishment for laziness is rather obvious, so it is time to split up the expedition to speed discoveries."
  BLS_factory_with_state:0 "A Factory with a State"
  BLS_factory_with_state_desc:0 "With the various changes that have been implemented in the nation since the Goddess first was shown the state of modern industry is nothing short of a miracle. Ponies now labor around the clock to forge weapons for our military. Most of the griping has silenced, and more are becoming happy to toil for a shred of Solar Flare's mercy. In all, our economy is an envy of every infidel on the planet!"
  BLS_old_memories:0 "Old Memories"
  BLS_old_memories_desc:0 "With the palace finally cleared, adn the sealed throne room of the Goddess uncovered, Solar Flare has taken a personal interest in exploring what used to be her home. As she normally is followed by a few lackies, it is surprising she went down by herself. Perhaps there is one final secret that this palace still holds?"

  ###Leader Descriptions###
  POLITICS_SOLAR_FLARE_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: At least 5000 BLB\n\n§YBiography§!: Once, eons ago, the continent of Equus was a far different land. Pony settlements were few and scattered, and they kept their relevant cliques. Great pegasus enclaves floated in the sky, rarely trading with their neighbors above or on the ground. Earth ponies tilled the dirt, hoarding most of their crop for themselves, and barely providing for everypony else. Unicorns, the most powerful of the three, neither toiled for their food nor aided in weather. For the price of protection from harm, they were given what was left of the goods from the earth pony tribes. Frequently they would take more, leading to increased strife in all aspects.\n\nAll of this was not what they believed the great Faust, creator of the world and universe, had intended. She believed that her ponies would live in harmony, utilizing their innate talents to complement and support each other. Ponies had sinned, and they needed salvation.\n\nFrom this, two new ponies arrived one day in the heart of the early Equish Empire. They were an odd combination: They had the strength of earth ponies, the flight of pegasi, and the magic of unicorns. Both claimed to be descended from the great Faust. The elder sister, Elysia, was forged from a piece of the sun; the younger, Selena, was crafted out of the face of the moon. Together, they healed the divide between the three tribes, and for centuries, their rule created harmony in the land.\n\nIt would not last, as the three tribes began their squabbles. A chasm opened, ripping apart those who were loyal to the diarchs, and those who believed their individuality was more important. In the culmination of the combatting, Selena was captured, and subsequently killed. It was in that moment, Elysia realized her mother's mistake: Ponies could not be controlled. They would have to be punished instead. The world was corrupt, and she would bring its destruction.\n\nSolar Flare is the epitome of power: her veins pulse with the plasma that fuels the sun itself. Bloodthirsty, haughty, unyielding, Solar Flare has one overarching goal: the punishment of ponykind for its rejection she and her sister. For she is death incarnate, and Equus's debt is finally to be collected.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: cameil"
  POLITICS_NEBULA_FLARE_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 23rd of January, 1020 in Manehattan\n\n§YBiography§!: Nebula Flare was one of the first ponies to graduate from Daybreaker's School for Blessed Unicorns. During her time, she achieved great heights through her studious nature and her desire to improve her knowledge in fire magic. When she was in her graduate class, she met another promising student, Aurora Shinespark, and the two of them worked together on a few final projects that catapulted Nebula into the position as the first archmage of Manehattan.\n\nAs archmage, Nebula was assigned the unenviable duty of ensuring the compliance of the city in honoring Daybreaker. Manehattan had only recently recovered from the first communist uprising in the city, and both Nebula and Aurora were dedicated to seeing their home remain loyal to the Empress. Additionally, she was assigned Aurora's studentship to eventually guide her to become an archmage.\n\nNebula eventually grew disenfranchised with the Solar Empire. Although most ponies refused to expand their horizons beyond limited aspects of their field, she constantly searched new sources of knowledge. Some of these were forbidden in the Empire. From them, she concluded that Daybreaker was deceiving all of Equus. She was no goddess, merely an alicorn who was a pony like any other.\n\nFor a time, Nebula still served, but her two charges, Aurora and Nova Glow, noticed the change, and secretly investigated her. When she found out, she fled the city, and the Empire. Branded a heretic for her studies, she sought refuge in the Bales Technocracy, where she was coldly accepted until her initial research projects bore fruit.\n\nNebula is meticulous and patient. With a streak of sarcasm, she is prone to wait until more information is available until she makes a decision. However, she is obsessed with indications of alternate realities, and Bales under her direction has specialized in that field. Some say that she is not the true leader, but nopony has seen any indication otherwise, although a strange, pink pony has been seen visiting her lab frequently...\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Avrameow"
  POLITICS_BLAZING_SHEATH_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: Around 3875 BLB in Balesh'ka Serath (Modern-day Bales)\n\nFor centuries after the apparent death of Solar Flare, the squabbling of the different pony nation states grew, as they no longer had a unifying force in the ancient alicorns of old. Pegasi moved once again to their cloud cities, sealing off vital resources for the earth pony farmers; the earth ponies refused to pay tribute to the unicorns, who in turn lashed out and sacked swaths of land as retribution for starving many of their communities.\n\nInto this chaos was born Blazing Sheath. Little is known of her past, for she is just as mysterious as the great goddess that she serves. Living initially almost five thousand years ago, Blazing Sheath was raised in a small village that was long lost to the sands of time. Precious few scraps are understood beyond that.\n\nSometime after reaching adulthood, she encountered a priestess of the Solaris Perditionem. At least twice in the past different prophetesses had arisen to lead the cult to attempt to resurrect their hibernating Solar Flare, but to no avail. When she met this priestess, it was to be a fateful day, for she soon learned the true gifts of her fiery abilities.\n\nWhile she had spent some time working with smithing tools for unicorn soldiers, she eventually stopped, disappearing entirely from her life with her family and in the greater region. Years passed, and she reappeared in the ancient Bales region, leading a secret sect of ponies who attempted to bring back the spirit of Solar Flare. It was to no avail, as its location was hard to hide in the grand library of the city. In the aftermath of the fight, she took her last few surviving members and fled north, to an ancient temple housing Solar Flare's body.\n\nPursued, she sacrificed herself to curse the ponies who would dare try to destroy her goddess, trapping her own soul in the catacombs of the temple. Now, resurrected to serve again Solar Flare, she is prepared to lead the armies of the undead cultists against all those who dare oppose the alicorn. Whether for vengeance for the years she lost to her family, or for a devotion to the sun goddess remains unseen. Traces of her descendants' past occasionally come to light, and she has gathered inklings of one who lives in the Solar Empire.\n\nYet not even familial status will stop her. For in her own words: \"Solar Flare is light, and light must always purify the darkness from the world.\""
  POLITICS_BUNSEN_BEAKER_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 19th of September, 997 in Bitterbury\n\n§YBiography§!: Youngest of three brothers, Bunsen Beaker was born in Luna Nova, where he spent much of his time studying and reading, despite the heckling that he received from the rest of his family. Unlike many of the lucky who lived in the city, his parents barely had the money to afford him food, let alone send him to university like he dreamed. To them, wasting time on knowledge was pointless when they struggled to make ends' meet.\n\nEventually, though, after clawing enough savings to at least attend first year of university in advanced magic theory and how it interacted with the different races, he received a scholarship to finish his education in Solar Beauty University near Bales. From there, he graduated with honors before remaining on for a post-graduate research study.\n\nDuring the Great War, he remained low-profile and eventually received tenure just before Daybreaker ascended. Seeing how the universities were becoming more neglected under Daybreaker's rule, he grew to advocate for their funding and how they could assist the Empire. When Daybreaker remained adamant, he formed a cabal with various professors in the region, soon organizing a faculty and student uprising which removed the Empire from power in 1028.\n\nAs Bales' Director, Bunsen leads the Directorate of academics and heads different research projects of his own. Over the years, he's grown more obsessed with immortality and solving the final question of death, sometimes ranting about it unprovoked. Rumors abound of strange occurrences in his lab, but nopony dares venture near them, lest they disappear like some of his other strongest opponents.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: pfeffaroo"

One of the resurrected members of Solar Flare's ancient Solaris Perditionem cult, this pony channels their leader's aggression above all else. They have little time to learn the new ways of the world, and happily sacrifice hordes of soldiers under them to the meat grinder of battle.§!"
  flame_master:0 "Flame Master"
  flame_master_desc:0 "§LBorn in the ancient region of Sennistin, Purple Haze was inducted into the Solaris Perditionem during one of the final attempts to revive her goddess, Solar Flare. Like her fellow priestess, Blazing Sheath, she sacrificed herself rather than be captured by the foes of the cleansing light. Resurrected by her goddes, she gleefully leads the charge against the rebellious world that has greeted her.§!"
  prophetess_of_death:0 "Prophetess of Death"
  prophetess_of_death_desc:0 "§LAs a pony from the ancient past of Equestria, Blazing Sheath barely has a care for the soldiers under her command. Used to being obeyed by her lessers, she has little care for the life of the soldiers she now leads into battle. After all, they are worthy of punishment, too, and there is no better way to judge both sides than letting them kill each other en masse.§!"
  timeless_fury:0 "Timeless Fury"
  timeless_fury_desc:0 "§LFor millennia, Blazing Sheath sat in isolation only learning snippets of what the outside world accomplished. With every new piece of information she learned, her distaste for the opulence, the debauchery, and the irreverence to Solar Flare grew. Now unleashed as Solar Flare's supreme general, she has more than enough ponies to use to exact her own brand of punishment. Who cares if a few guilty get killed along the way?§!"
  jaded_pragmatist:0 "Jaded Pragmatist"
  jaded_pragmatist_desc:0 "§LOne of the three former sirens, Aria Blaze is the most level-headed of her sisters. Contrasted to Adagio's renewed conniving and Sonata's constant ignorance, Aria has grown more irritable with time, especially since her suggestions have been ignored frequently despite their merit. Regardless of these sore points, she has taken a position of leadership in the military and has proven quite capable.§!"
  steadfast_disciple:0 "Steadfast Disciple"
  steadfast_disciple_desc:0 "§LWhen the ponies banded together to prevent Solar Flare's resurrection the first time, Melting Point stayed behind to ensure a way for the future to know how to find the great alicorn and return her to the world. For her sacrifice, leading to her death in the ancient library, she has been made one of Solar Flare's generals, her stubborn and unwavering personality transferring to the troops under her command to hold off agaisnt any threat to her goddess.§!"
  marshal_of_science:0 "Marshal of Science"
  marshal_of_science_desc:0 "§LTasked with protecting the Bales Technocracy, Bright Vector has avoided multiple conflicts within the last twenty years due to his quick wit. In the case of conflict, he always prioritizes knowledge above all else, and frequently triple-checks scouting intel before attacking, which has saved his troops dozens of times in the past while serving in the Equestrian Army.§!"
  nerdy_jock:0 "Science's Athelete"
  nerdy_jock_desc:0 "§LAs one of the only athletes in Bales' Sol Victoria University to move on to also include study in the hard sciences, Marathon has gained recognition as somepony more than just a jock. Other Mechanicus members may still mock her for devoting time to "excessive" exercise, but her troops have been pushed to the limit and will go farther and harder than anypony else.§!"
  precise_orator:0 "Precise Orator"
  precise_orator_desc:0 "§LBorn in Canterlot shortly before Daybreaker's ascension, Fine Cursive knows the importance of proper and efficient communication from all angles of leadership, since she assisted the creation of the Mechanicus Deus. Instructions from her to lackeys are clear and concise with minimal chance of error being read, which is a wonder for coordinating strikes and logistics.§!"
  hyperactive:0 "Hyperactive"
  hyperactive_desc:0 "§LRainbow Dash has always been overeager for new experiences, from the very first day that she joined the soccer team in Canterlot Highschool. From then on, a passion was fed to try novel things again and again, whether or not they were the wisest of ideas. This has carried over into leadership, as always being on the move makes it difficult for her troops to maintain cohesion.§!"
  cynical_idealist:0 "Skeptic"
  cynical_idealist_desc:0 "§LSome days, there are difficulties in believing anything said to oneself, especially if that one pony happens to be Sunset Shimmer. After decades of claiming to be in places she wasn't, things she didn't, doubt and mistrust became part and parcel of her. Keeping this cynical wit has given her an edge in discering truth, now that's stuck in Equus, even if she herself is now distrusted by those she commands.§!"
