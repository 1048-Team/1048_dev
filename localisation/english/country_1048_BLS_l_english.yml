  ###Focus Trees###

  BLS_in_the_name_of_science:0 "In the Name of Science"
  BLS_in_the_name_of_science_desc:0 "As we enter yet another year in the history of Bales, it is ever-important to remember why we are here. For the advancement of science and knowledge, away from the restrictions and eyes of those like in the Solar Empire. There is much still to learn, and there is little time to waste."
  BLS_changing_directions:0 "Changing Directions"
  BLS_changing_directions_desc:0 "Our Director, Bunsen Beaker, has done great work in the past, but he has hit a bit of a snag on his primary project. While it is unfortunate, it gives ample opportunity to pursue his other ambition years in the making; plasma weaponry. Already close to completition, he is confident that with one final focused effort, it will be ready."
  BLS_work_with_the_directorate:0 "Work with the Directorate"
  BLS_work_with_the_directorate_desc:0 "The Directorate, a board made up of each of the five universities of Bales, has been quite the annoyance in years past for our goals. Yet despite that, they remain an important group should we wish to continue our necessary research. Ensuring their continued support is critical for our continued success."
  BLS_status_of_the_mechanicus:0 "Status of the Mechanicus"
  BLS_status_of_the_mechanicus_desc:0 "The Mechanicus Deus, a cult-like group devoted to knowledge and in large part our Director, has undergone a bit of an issue in recent years. Sharply split now between lines of ethics, tensions are always a present issue, yet an escalation of conflict is not something we can afford. Peace will be maintained between the two, at least until a more permanent solution can be found."
  BLS_unfortunate_realities:0 "Unfortunate Realities"
  BLS_unfortunate_realities_desc:0 "Bunsen is loath to admit it, but the writing on the wall is clear. If he is to finish the Plasma project in time, he will require additional help in the form of his Vice-Director, Stratus Stream. A talented and influencial researcher in her own right, her expertise will be invaluable, even if conflict between the two is sure to arise..."

  ###Solar Flare###
  BLS_the_awakening:0 "The Awakening"
  BLS_the_awakening_desc:0 "At last, after so many millennia, she has been freed. The dawn approaches for Equus, and none shall escape the searing light of Her fury."
  BLS_first_follower:0 "The First Follower"
  BLS_first_follower_desc:0 "It is a strange and unnerving experience to awaken from slumber after thousands of years. To see odd ponies, descendants of the traitors, poking, prodding, and probing one's flesh even more. Yet, the Goddess has decided that one shall be spared. The one who made the "mistake" and overloaded the matrices that brought her back. She will die last, and in the meantime, she will serve well."
  BLS_atheists_everywhere:0 "Atheists Everywhere"
  BLS_atheists_everywhere_desc:0 "Untold ages have passed since the last of the generation that knew of Solar Flare died out. Now, society has progressed beyond its humble and dutiful reverence of alicorns as the deities they are. Ponies believe themselves masters of their fates, with their "knowledge" and "science" but they have fallen into infidelity instead. The Goddess shall correct this, and do so justly."
  BLS_thousand_year_nap:0 "The Millennia-long Slumber"
  BLS_thousand_year_nap_desc:0 "Although she was aware of her surroundings for the thousands of years she was sealed away, the Goddess has never seen the unbelievable advancement that the world has undergone while she was gone. Advanced applications of spells, electronics, refridgeration, among myriad other new things can prove overwhelming. Thankfully, there is a pony that can teach her all of it, whether she wants to or not."
  BLS_spare_nerds:0 "Spare the Smartest"
  BLS_spare_nerds_desc:0 "Unsurprisingly, with the sudden jump in mortality rate, many of the scientists and researchers in the universities have begun to flee before they become the next to meet Solar Flare, which is leading to a sudden brain drain. However, a number know Nebula Flare personally, and if she could convince them to swear loyalty with no requirement to worship the Goddess, then we could stem the worst of it."
  BLS_spare_jocks:0 "Spare the Strongest"
  BLS_spare_jocks_desc:0 "Untold throngs of ponies, more than ever lived in the domain of the Goddess thousands of years ago, toil in the factories and construction sites of the Directorate's designs. Since our savior's return, they have poured out in droves to fight agaisnt the few of us who currently serve her. However, she has decided that she will deal with this issue personally and correct their error."
  BLS_instruct_weak:0 "Instruct the Weak"
  BLS_instruct_weak_desc:0 "While those who were "convinced" by Nebula have stayed on, they are only simple, imperfect ponies who see no rhyme or reason to life. Because of their foolish worldview, they have cut themselves off from potential solutions to some of the greatest physical problems of their day. It is time she enlighten their empty minds."
  BLS_whelps_mission:0 "The Whelp's Mission"
  BLS_whelps_mission_desc:0 "Although Nebula Flare has proven her usefulness thus far, she has yet to convince the Goddess that she will follow orders completely, especially when her leash is slackened. Despite the Goddess's mercy through restoring her eyesight, she could still be rebellious. To prove her loyalty, she will be given the most important, but measurable task: the last High Priestess must be restored."
  BLS_first_task:0 "A Mighty First Task"
  BLS_first_task_desc:0 "Now that a number of workers have pledged themselves to Solar Flare, we can begin on recapturing the beauty of the former capital of the Goddess's empire. Thousands of years of erosion, weather patterns, and the effects of the final resurrection attempt have left it unrecognizable, but with these new bodies, the restoration will be accomplished."
  BLS_zealous_nerds:0 "Push Them to Zealotry"
  BLS_zealous_nerds_desc:0 "Bales primarily relied on a small, professional military comprised of perhaps a few thousand souls, with the rest being militia that would defend the nation if invaded by any of their neighbors. Only a few remained loyal, and they are also looking to desert. Yet the Goddess desires them to be the first of her new soldiers, and if it involves some coercion to stay, then so be it."
  BLS_correcting_primitives:0 "Correcting the Primitives"
  BLS_correcting_primitives_desc:0 "The Whelp has delivered a report of her findings, and after tracing the recorded history of Blazing Sheath's life - which was minimal - Nebula Flare has reached one conclusion. Blazing Sheath led the last defense of the Perditionem, and is somewhere in the same catacombs as the Goddess's resting place. Marechester will not appreciate the second visit."
  BLS_reface_land:0 "Reface the Land"
  BLS_reface_land_desc:0 "Now that the foundations have been set, we can begin to establish new blocs for the servants of the Goddess to reside and to toil. Great swathes of the outer-city will be reclaimed from nature so that we may construct great monuments to the Bright Day Star, and all those who see them will weep."
  BLS_mortals_dissent:0 "Mortals' One Dissent"
  BLS_mortals_dissent_desc:0 "As the difficulty of replacing ponies on short notice becomes apparent, the Goddess has decreed that she will provide mercy this one time to those who still fight against her will. All those in the military and militia must swear loyalty to her, though, lest her grace be revoked. It is doubtful many will be that foolish."
  BLS_fresh_blood:0 "Fresh Blood"
  BLS_fresh_blood_desc:0 "Having proved her mettle, Nebula Flare is the ideal candidate for working with the Goddess on her plans for punishing the world. As she is knowledgable on the modern world, she has experience where Blazing Sheath lacks, and her unique thinking will provide apt input for Solar Flare into the future."
  BLS_last_chance:0 "A Faithful's Last Chance"
  BLS_last_chance_desc:0 "As punishment for failure, Blazing Sheath had been left in torment, her soul stuck between this world and the afterlife. Now with her forgiveness, she has been provided the opportunity to show her competency to the Goddess again. Who else would be qualified to lead the Perditionem than her?"
  BLS_unearth_old_palace:0 "Unearth the Old Palace"
  BLS_unearth_old_palace_desc:0 "For part of our restructing of Bales, we will continue to excavate this "necropolis" that was discovered by the Directorate. In actuality, it is the buried city of Paelit, the Goddess's rightful home. What lays buried beneath remains to be seen, as the city was cleansed in the final war with the traitors. Only time will tell what secrets it holds."
  BLS_sun_guidance:0 "Guidance from the Sun"
  BLS_sun_guidance_desc:0 "It is laughable how the Balish leaders have neglected the state of their military so much. For even a small nation, the numbers and tactics employeed by the Technocracy were pathetic. If they were to be attacked by any real force, they would have collapsed within days. Thankfully, the Goddess knows war perfectly, and has deigned to lead our soldiers in glorious combat."
  BLS_salvage_magics:0 "Salvage New Magics"
  BLS_salvage_magics_desc:0 "Not everything that has been created by the vile Directorate is unfit for the faithful's use. While most of it is infidel refuse, the recent developments of using magic to containn miniature solar reactions could prove quite useful, especially if employed en masse. Perhaps there is some benefit to their foolishiness after all."
  BLS_proclaim_new_kingdom:0 "The Kingdom of Perdition"
  BLS_proclaim_new_kingdom_desc:0 "With our initial takeover from the Directorate complete, we can now reveal ourselves to the world. Every creature, every soul upon this wretched planet will learn of their determined fate, and they will tremble in fear of our Goddess and Her righteous judgement!"
  BLS_rebellious_masses:0 "The Rebellious Masses"
  BLS_rebellious_masses_desc:0 "Despite our complete control of their lives, the ponies of Bales and the surrounding states refuse to bow the knee to their Goddess. Insurrection has only continued to climb, which has endangered those who have followed their calling of submission. We must rectify this dire situation soon."
  BLS_last_guardian:0 "Reward the Last Guardian"
  BLS_last_guardian_desc:0 "Blazing Sheath was not the only pony involved in the final attempt to return Solar Flare to the world centuries ago. Were it not for Melting Point's meticulous journals in her last days in the ancient city, Nebula Flare would never have found the Goddess and initiated this world's judgement. Melting Point should be blessed in kind."
  BLS_new_works_master:0 "Appoint a New Master of Works"
  BLS_new_works_master_desc:0 "When the Goddess once ruled her empire before she was killed, she had had multiple ponies in positions of architectural projects, so that her servants could continue to edify her supremacy in works of art. Now that there is another, new empire for Her to rule, we must find somepony appropriate for the position, and there is one member of the Directorate that files the bill perfectly."
  
  ###Political###
  BLS_open_the_tombs:0 "Open the Tombs"
  BLS_open_the_tombs_desc:0 "In the beginning, during the original war against the traitors, many ponies pledged their lives to serve the Goddess's will. Great mausoleums were built as the war stretched on and casualties piled up. Now it is time to call upon these resting faithful again, so they may serve from the grave."
  BLS_the_twelve:0 "The Twelve"
  BLS_the_twelve_desc:0 "To fully finalize the Goddess's control, she needs appropriate servants to implement her will far and wide. While Nebula Flare and Blazing Sheath are a start, they are only two ponies, and have more meaningful tasks than what Solar Flare's inner circle would need to do. Proper followers, dedicated to the cause, or to promises of reward, are needed."
  BLS_influence_the_foalish:0 "Influence the Foolish"
  BLS_influence_the_foalish_desc:0 "Despite their desire for freedom and their steadfast adherrence to "knowledge" and "freewill," the majority of the ponies fighting against the Goddess are nothing but mindless sheep. We have instructed more of our followers in how to effectively inspire, entice, or threaten these hapless layponies back to us, and it is now time to disperse them through the countryside. Their labor will not be in vain."
  BLS_leave_them_undead:0 "Leave Them Undead"
  BLS_leave_them_undead_desc:0 "Uncountable numbers of the ancient Perditionem or the warriors that pledged their lives to Solar Flare lay beneath the ground of Bales and other ancient sites. It is unrealistic to expect either the Goddess or her servants to bring every one back to this world, when a simple necromancy spell will give us a mindless servant to act as cannon fodder. More bodies are preferrable for the coming war."
  BLS_born_again:0 "Born Again"
  BLS_born_again_desc:0 "There are untold numbers of faithful servants and loyal warriers that perished in the first war withe the traitors, and it would be unmerciful of the Goddess to leave them buried or to return as mindless, rotting husks to be used as simple tools. It may be more taxing, but we must do our part to bring back every brother or sister to fight for Solar Flare in their greatest capacity."
  BLS_direct_to_grave:0 "Direct Them to the Grave"
  BLS_direct_to_grave_desc:0 "The vile Directorate encapsulates everything that Solar Flare is not. They are haughty, arrogant enough to believe they can discover every answer, when the answer to everything they seek is directly in front of them. As an embodiment of the spirit of rebellion that filled this world centuries ago, there is only one fate befitting them: Holy fire."
  BLS_promise_salvation:0 "Promise Them Salvation"
  BLS_promise_salvation_desc:0 "Although many will serve us, there are numerous others that are wary of us, and claim we want nothing more than to see the world burn around us. They are not entirely wrong, but we must get every body serving the Goddess, no matter what we must say or do. To that end, a small twisting of the Goddess's plans to be marketed as a saving grace is required. When they accept it, it will be too late to back out."
  BLS_promise_death:0 "Promise Them Death"
  BLS_promise_death_desc:0 "There is no need to hide what we desire: the destruction of this world and its sinful state is the greatest mission that any pony could be given. With nations all around us hostile, we can only ensure one thing that will befall our followers: a glorious death and fulfilling of the ultimate purpose of serving the Goddess. And that will all that need be said."
  BLS_apostolic_rebirth:0 "Rebirth of the Apostles"
  BLS_apostolic_rebirth_desc:0 "In the time of Solar Flare, four great servants of the Perditionem were appointed to head all aspects of the cult, underneath the High Priestess and of course, the Goddess herself. These zealous followers have been found amongst the graves, and it is time for them to restart their holy mission."
  BLS_no_distinction:0 "No Difference Between Life and Death"
  BLS_no_distinction_desc:0 "There is no meaning in the world outside of serving the Goddess, and whether one works in the factories, the mines, or the military, one has equal important to accomplish her goals. Even the soldiers are a vital piece of her plans, and death is not the final end to their service. Only when she is done will they meet the sweet embrace of the afterlife."
  BLS_temples_not_schools:0 "Temples Instead of Schools"
  BLS_temples_not_schools_desc:0 "While it is a despicable waste of time and resources, the universities and public education of the former Technocracy is incredibly robust, and at the moment, ponies have still been attending without much disruption. However, these could be put to use teaching far more important things than mathematics or physics: how to be a perfect servant for Solar Flare."
  BLS_slaves_of_the_mind:0 "Slaves of the Mind"
  BLS_slaves_of_the_mind_desc:0 "Until now, the laypony has been secure knowing that their thoughts, their hidden desires and sins, were their own, and nopony could see them. That was until the Goddess regained enough strength to see her servants' minds. Nothing can be hidden from her for long, and less can be done to resist her will if she directs on a pony."
  BLS_leave_to_priestesses:0 "Leave it to the Priestesses"
  BLS_leave_to_priestesses_desc:0 "With the amount of work that must still be accomplished, it is unwise to leave the Goddess with bearing the brunt of running the increasingly complex country that lays before her. As the role of High Priestess is still currently split between two ponies, it shall be left to them. They have more than enough time to handle it."
  BLS_control_the_traitors:0 "Direct Control"
  BLS_control_the_traitors_desc:0 "Although it appears almost insurmountable, the work that still lays undone to shape the nation into a singularly focused weapon to destroy the world is too difficult for anypony else other than Solar Flare. Nopony else is competent enough to see her vision to completetion, so she will forge the figurative blade herself. Woe to anypony who stands against her!"
  
  ###Priestesses###
  BLS_improvement_directive:0 "An Improvement Directive"
  BLS_improvement_directive_desc:0 "With Solar Flare pulling back from direct influence on the path of the country, that provides some leeway for a few policy changes. These will be designed around protecting the few scientists and teachers that are still left in [ROOT.GetName], as we need at least SOME ponies to advance our industry."
  BLS_zealous_directive:0 "A Zealous Directive"
  BLS_zealous_directive_desc:0 "Just because Solar Flare has given control of the nation over to the two High Priestesses, that does not mean we can sit idly by and let the essence of the Perditionem degrade from Nebula's influence. Enshrining further benefits for those who willingly serve the Goddess will keep us on the right track."
  BLS_find_reason_to_madness:0 "Find Reason to the Madness"
  BLS_find_reason_to_madness_desc:0 "Quantifying the insane devotion that Solar Flare inspires amongst her followers is next to impossible. To understand how religion has worked its way again into Bales, also unrealistic to comprehend. However, that doesn't mean we can't attempt to understand a few of the nuances in our new position."
  BLS_honor_guard_of_the_goddess:0 "Honor Guard of the Goddess"
  BLS_honor_guard_of_the_goddess_desc:0 "As the war with the world slowly approaches, we must ensure that the Goddess is protected from any potential threat to her rule. To that end, identifying the most zealous and loyal among the cult will be required and an elite force to strike hardest will be formed, where they will serve for eternity."
  BLS_new_paint:0 "New Coats of Paint"
  BLS_new_paint_desc:0 "Perhaps it was wishful thinking to figure out the twisted logic of the cult, but there are other distractions that can at least improve layponies while we are all still here. High Priestess Nebula and some of her old associates have spent countless hours improving civilian and military tech, and we are already reaping the benefits of their work."
  BLS_repurpose_resistance:0 "Repurpose the Resistance"
  BLS_repurpose_resistance_desc:0 "Although the atheistic resistance has been crushed, it is not unheard of to discover a new cell, or that an old one has restarted. They are woefully outmatched, but they provide an ample scapegoat. Embellishing some of their worst acts, or lying about their purpose could drive more ponies into a frenzy to serve the Goddess."
  BLS_scheme_to_succeed:0 "Disjointed Priorities"
  BLS_scheme_to_succeed_desc:0 "Since the role of leadership has fallen upon both High Priestesses, spats have not been unheard of over sometimes trivial things. As of late, the issue of where resources are allocated has become the hot-button topic. It remains to be seen how Nebula and Blazing will resolve the disagreement."
  BLS_who_needs_education:0 "Who Needs an Education?"
  BLS_who_needs_education_desc:0 "If our citizens will merely perish in glorious combat, and the ones who do not can taught on the job, why should we bother wasting time with academic pursuits? The ponies and costs will be better put to use elsewhere. Like a new statue to Solar Flare."
  BLS_return_to_ponke:0 "Returning to the Old Ways"
  BLS_return_to_ponke_desc:0 "Since Blazing has gained enough influence, she has attempted time and again to reduce the living standards of the laypony, to both motivate them to join the cult, and also to focus the resources elsewhere. This has not gone over well, to say the least, and Nebula has been grumbling about it. We can only hope it doesn't explode into something worse."
  BLS_science_always_wins:0 "Science Always Triumphs"
  BLS_science_always_wins_desc:0 "Through some clever manevuering, Nebula has gained some backing by the Perditionem and has begun to act more boldly on her less orthodox projects. This has garnered attention, but at this point, it seems there is little that anypony else can do about it. Science has endured, after all."
  BLS_heresy_never_wins:0 "Infidels Never Triumph"
  BLS_heresy_never_wins_desc:0 "As Blazing has regained more of her former supporters, she has centralized many of the decisions for the Perditionem to just her and her clique. Inductions into the cult have skyrocketed, and it appears that the threats to the Goddess have dwindled. Outside of Nebula and her ilk, that is."
  BLS_apply_magic_tech:0 "Apply Further Magical Technology"
  BLS_apply_magic_tech_desc:0 "There are numerous inefficiences and failings within the Perditionem that can be shored up with even basic usage of technology that's been in the Technocracy for decades. Dragging a few Luddites into the eleventh century would do everypony some - temporary - good."
  BLS_meet_basic_needs:0 "Meet Everypony's Needs"
  BLS_meet_basic_needs_desc:0 "It may be inevitable that the world will end, but there should still be some effort to preserving the lives of our citizens. Advancements in medical technology may not excite Blazing Sheath or others, but it will ead to stronger workers. And worshipers."
  BLS_primacy_of_mind:0 "Primacy of the Mind"
  BLS_primacy_of_mind_desc:0 "Ponies are not just mindless sacks of flesh that are meant to follow a leader, but they are creatures with minds and wills that can come up with ingenious solutions to problems. If we do not allow them some room to breathe, we will collapse upon ourselves and be overwhelmed by our enemies."
  BLS_primacy_of_soul:0 "Primacy of the Soul"
  BLS_primacy_of_soul_desc:0 "Everypony's duty is to serve without question the commands of the Goddess or her High Priestess. Freewill is but an illusion, crafted by apostates and infidels to encourage sin. We may not have the most advanced weapons, but our faith will carry us to everypony's end."
  BLS_expand_death_cults:0 "Expand the Perditionem"
  BLS_expand_death_cults_desc:0 "With the growing length of the Goddess's reign, ponies are starting to acclimate to her rule, and many more are showing interest in joining the Perditionem. If we drive recruitment even harder, we will have more than enough warm - or cold - bodies to serve the Goddess for eternity."
  BLS_prioritize_faithful:0 "Prioritize the Faithful"
  BLS_prioritize_faithful_desc:0 "Nebula Flare believes that Blazing is ignoring the heatlh of everypony. It is not the case. Simply put, the state of the layponies is of no concern to the blessed of Solar Flare. However, the state of our own must be tended to, lest any grow too weak or sick to serve her to their utmost."
  BLS_modern_as_can_be:0 "As Modern as Can Be"
  BLS_modern_as_can_be_desc:0 "Through enough hard work, Nebula has managed to wrangle most of the control of the Perditionem away from Blazing and now can direct some of its reform without interruption. There still are a few loose ends, namely how to rid the nation of Blazing permanently without inciting uproar. There are always ways to be found, though."
  BLS_faithful_as_can_be:0 "As Faithful as Can Be"
  BLS_faithful_as_can_be_desc:0 "At last, enough of the Perditionem has been swayed by Blazing Sheath to back her once again that any hope Nebula had of moderating the cult can be considered eliminated. And, with total control, comes finally ridding the final gasps of the infidels from the cult, as gruesomely as possible."
  BLS_purgatory_on_equus:0 "Purgatory on Equus"
  BLS_purgatory_on_equus_desc:0 "Bales has been reshaped into an image of what will be to come for the rest of Equus, and then the world. Ponies from far and near seen their fate, which will be an eternal existence of suffering for their sins, before ultimate destruction. Our faithful High Priestess will lead the charge into the mouth of our enemies, and return victorious!"
  
  ###Solar Flare###
  BLS_spare_weakest:0 "Weakest for Labor"
  BLS_spare_weakest_desc:0 "It is a reality that not everypony in the country can fight on the frontlines. Some are too old, young, or incapable to properly wield a weapon to attack our foes. That doesn't mean they are useless, however. If they were hoping the be spared from their comrades' fate, they are mistaken. They'll simply be used for another, easier purpose."
  BLS_weakest_for_fodder:0 "Use the Infirm as Fodder"
  BLS_weakest_for_fodder_desc:0 "It is true that not everypony in the nation can sesrve as proper soldiers to fight for the end of creation. Whether they are incompetent, too young, or too old, they have some reason for their incapability in battle. However, that doesn't mean they are spared. We'll simply use them as shields for our proper units, and leave them to their fate."
  BLS_show_suns_might:0 "Show the Sun's Might"
  BLS_show_suns_might_desc:0 "So far, the punishment for the infidels and apostates of the land have been doled out by the Perditionem. With Solar Flare assuming total control of the country, there are some who still doubt whether she is the goddess that she claims to be. A simple reminder, through exacting justice with her own hooves, should be ample reminder enough."
  BLS_institute_fear_of_failure:0 "Institute Fear of Failure"
  BLS_institute_fear_of_failure_desc:0 "One of the contributions to the Goddess's last defeat was the lack of retribution for failing to achieve her desired outcomes. Of course, part of this was due to Solar Flare's undead state, but the fact remains that ponies in the cult, and in the greater ruling apparatus have yet to understand the peril they are in if they fail Solar Flare. That will require correcting. Immediately."
  BLS_review_military:0 "Review the "Military""
  BLS_review_military_desc:0 "The heart of Bales's defense is the Ministry of Arcane Defenses, which also is the primary military department for the region. While they have a number of skilled leaders, they have remained, through it all, rather independent. Reports of infidelity have remained high. It is time that it has its reins tightened with a few new appointments that will inform the Goddess of any wrongdoing."

  ###Leader Descriptions###
  POLITICS_SOLAR_FLARE_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: At least 5000 BLB\n\n§YBiography§!: Once, eons ago, the continent of Equus was a far different land. Pony settlements were few and scattered, and they kept their relevant cliques. Great pegasus enclaves floated in the sky, rarely trading with their neighbors above or on the ground. Earth ponies tilled the dirt, hoarding most of their crop for themselves, and barely providing for everypony else. Unicorns, the most powerful of the three, neither toiled for their food nor aided in weather. For the price of protection from harm, they were given what was left of the goods from the earth pony tribes. Frequently they would take more, leading to increased strife in all aspects.\n\nAll of this was not what they believed the great Faust, creator of the world and universe, had intended. She believed that her ponies would live in harmony, utilizing their innate talents to complement and support each other. Ponies had sinned, and they needed salvation.\n\nFrom this, two new ponies arrived one day in the heart of the early Equish Empire. They were an odd combination: They had the strength of earth ponies, the flight of pegasi, and the magic of unicorns. Both claimed to be descended from the great Faust. The elder sister, Elysia, was forged from a piece of the sun; the younger, Selena, was crafted out of the face of the moon. Together, they healed the divide between the three tribes, and for centuries, their rule created harmony in the land.\n\nIt would not last, as the three tribes began their squabbles. A chasm opened, ripping apart those who were loyal to the diarchs, and those who believed their individuality was more important. In the culmination of the combatting, Selena was captured, and subsequently killed. It was in that moment, Elysia realized her mother's mistake: Ponies could not be controlled. They would have to be punished instead. The world was corrupt, and she would bring its destruction.\n\nSolar Flare is the epitome of power: her veins pulse with the plasma that fuels the sun itself. Bloodthirsty, haughty, unyielding, Solar Flare has one overarching goal: the punishment of ponykind for its rejection she and her sister. For she is death incarnate, and Equus's debt is finally to be collected.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: cameil"
  POLITICS_NEBULA_FLARE_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: January 23rd, 1020 ALB\n\n§YBiography§!: Born in Manehattan, Nebula Flare was one of the first ponies to graduate from Daybreaker's School for Blessed Unicorns. During her time, she achieved great heights through her studious nature and her desire to improve her knowledge in fire magic. When she was in her graduate class, she met another promising student, Aurora Shinespark, and the two of them worked together on a few final projects that catapulted Nebula into the position as the first archmage of Manehattan.\n\nAs archmage, Nebula was assigned the unenviable duty of ensuring the compliance of the city in honoring Daybreaker. Manehattan had only recently recovered from the first communist uprising in the city, and both Nebula and Aurora were dedicated to seeing their home remain loyal to the Empress. Additionally, she was assigned Aurora's studentship to eventually guide her to become an archmage.\n\nNebula eventually grew disenfranchised with the Solar Empire. Although most ponies refused to expand their horizons beyond limited aspects of their field, she constantly searched new sources of knowledge. Some of these were forbidden in the Empire. From them, she concluded that Daybreaker was deceiving all of Equus. She was no goddess, merely an alicorn who was a pony like any other.\n\nFor a time, Nebula still served, but her two charges, Aurora and Nova Glow, noticed the change, and secretly investigated her. When she found out, she fled the city, and the Empire. Branded a heretic for her studies, she sought refuge in the Bales Technocracy, where she was coldly accepted until her initial research projects bore fruit.\n\nNebula is meticulous and patient. With a streak of sarcasm, she is prone to wait until more information is available until she makes a decision. However, she is obsessed with indications of alternate realities, and Bales under her direction has specialized in that field. Some say that she is not the true leader, but nopony has seen any indication otherwise, although a strange, pink pony has been seen visiting her lab frequently...\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Avrameow"
  POLITICS_BLAZING_SHEATH_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: Around 3875 BLB\n\nFor centuries after the apparent death of Solar Flare, the squabbling of the different pony nation states grew, as they no longer had a unifying force in the ancient alicorns of old. Pegasi moved once again to their cloud cities, sealing off vital resources for the earth pony farmers; the earth ponies refused to pay tribute to the unicorns, who in turn lashed out and sacked swaths of land as retribution for starving many of their communities.\n\nInto this chaos was born Blazing Sheath. Little is known of her past, for she is just as mysterious as the great goddess that she serves. Living initially almost five thousand years ago, Blazing Sheath was raised in a small village that was long lost to the sands of time. Precious few scraps are understood beyond that.\n\nSometime after reaching adulthood, she encountered a priestess of the Solaris Perditionem. At least twice in the past different prophetesses had arisen to lead the cult to attempt to resurrect their hibernating Solar Flare, but to no avail. When she met this priestess, it was to be a fateful day, for she soon learned the true gifts of her fiery abilities.\n\nWhile she had spent some time working with smithing tools for unicorn soldiers, she eventually stopped, disappearing entirely from her life with her family and in the greater region. Years passed, and she reappeared in the ancient Bales region, leading a secret sect of ponies who attempted to bring back the spirit of Solar Flare. It was to no avail, as its location was hard to hide in the grand library of the city. In the aftermath of the fight, she took her last few surviving members and fled north, to an ancient temple housing Solar Flare's body.\n\nPursued, she sacrificed herself to curse the ponies who would dare try to destroy her goddess, trapping her own soul in the catacombs of the temple. Now, resurrected to serve again Solar Flare, she is prepared to lead the armies of the undead cultists against all those who dare oppose the alicorn. Whether for vengeance for the years she lost to her family, or for a devotion to the sun goddess remains unseen. Traces of her descendants' past occasionally come to light, and she has gathered inklings of one who lives in the Solar Empire.\n\nYet not even familial status will stop her. For in her own words: \"Solar Flare is light, and light must always purify the darkness from the world.\""
  POLITICS_BUNSEN_BEAKER_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: September 19th, 997 ALB\n\n§YBiography§!: Youngest of three brothers, Bunsen Beaker was born in Luna Nova, where he spent much of his time studying and reading, despite the heckling that he received from the rest of his family. Unlike many of the lucky who lived in the city, his parents barely had the money to afford him food, let alone send him to university like he dreamed. To them, wasting time on knowledge was pointless when they struggled to make ends' meet.\n\nEventually, though, after clawing enough savings to at least attend first year of university in advanced magic theory and how it interacted with the different races, he received a scholarship to finish his education in Solar Beauty University near Bales. From there, he graduated with honors before remaining on for a post-graduate research study.\n\nDuring the Great War, he remained low-profile and eventually received tenure just before Daybreaker ascended. Seeing how the universities were becoming more neglected under Daybreaker's rule, he grew to advocate for their funding and how they could assist the Empire. When Daybreaker remained adamant, he formed a cabal with various professors in the region, soon organizing a faculty and student uprising which removed the Empire from power in 1028.\n\nAs Bales' Director, Bunsen leads the Directorate of academics and heads different research projects of his own. Over the years, he's grown more obsessed with immortality and solving the final question of death, sometimes ranting about it unprovoked. Rumors abound of strange occurrences in his lab, but nopony dares venture near them, lest they disappear like some of his other strongest opponents.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: pfeffaroo"
