  ###Leader Descriptions###
  POLITICS_SOLAR_FLARE_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: At least 5000 BLB\n\n§YBiography§!: Once, eons ago, the continent of Equus was a far different land. Pony settlements were few and scattered, and they kept their relevant cliques. Great pegasus enclaves floated in the sky, rarely trading with their neighbors above or on the ground. Earth ponies tilled the dirt, hoarding most of their crop for themselves, and barely providing for everypony else. Unicorns, the most powerful of the three, neither toiled for their food nor aided in weather. For the price of protection from harm, they were given what was left of the goods from the earth pony tribes. Frequently they would take more, leading to increased strife in all aspects.\n\nAll of this was not what they believed the great Faust, creator of the world and universe, had intended. She believed that her ponies would live in harmony, utilizing their innate talents to complement and support each other. Ponies had sinned, and they needed salvation.\n\nFrom this, two new ponies arrived one day in the heart of the early Equish Empire. They were an odd combination: They had the strength of earth ponies, the flight of pegasi, and the magic of unicorns. Both claimed to be descended from the great Faust. The elder sister, Elysia, was forged from a piece of the sun; the younger, Selena, was crafted out of the face of the moon. Together, they healed the divide between the three tribes, and for centuries, their rule created harmony in the land.\n\nIt would not last, as the three tribes began their squabbles. A chasm opened, ripping apart those who were loyal to the diarchs, and those who believed their individuality was more important. In the culmination of the combatting, Selena was captured, and subsequently killed. It was in that moment, Elysia realized her mother's mistake: Ponies could not be controlled. They would have to be punished instead. The world was corrupt, and she would bring its destruction.\n\nSolar Flare is the epitome of power: her veins pulse with the plasma that fuels the sun itself. Bloodthirsty, haughty, unyielding, Solar Flare has one overarching goal: the punishment of ponykind for its rejection she and her sister. For she is death incarnate, and Equus' debt is finally to be collected.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: cameil"
  POLITICS_NEBULA_FLARE_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 1020 ALB\n\n§YBiography§!: Born in Manehattan, Nebula Flare was one of the first ponies to graduate from Daybreaker's School for Blessed Unicorns. During her time, she achieved great heights through her studious nature and her desire to improve her knowledge in fire magic. When she was in her graduate class, she met another promising student, Aurora Shinespark, and the two of them worked together on a few final projects that catapulted Nebula into the position as the first archmage of Manehattan.\n\nAs archmage, Nebula was assigned the unenviable duty of ensuring the compliance of the city in honoring Daybreaker. Manehattan had only recently recovered from the first communist uprising in the city, and both Nebula and Aurora were dedicated to seeing their home remain loyal to the Empress. Additionally, she was assigned Aurora's studentship to eventually guide her to become an archmage.\n\nNebula eventually grew disenfranchised with the Solar Empire. Although most ponies refused to expand their horizons beyond limited aspects of their field, she constantly searched new sources of knowledge. Some of these were forbidden in the Empire. From them, she concluded that Daybreaker was deceiving all of Equus. She was no goddess, merely an alicorn who was a pony like any other.\n\nFor a time, Nebula still served, but her two charges, Aurora and Nova Glow, noticed the change, and secretly investigated her. When she found out, she fled the city, and the Empire. Branded a heretic for her studies, she sought refuge in the Bales Technocracy, where she was coldly accepted until her initial research projects bore fruit.\n\nNebula is meticulous and patient. With a streak of sarcasm, she is prone to wait until more information is available until she makes a decision. However, she is obsessed with indications of alternate realities, and Bales under her direction has specialized in that field. Some say that she is not the true leader, but nopony has seen any indication otherwise, although a strange, pink pony has been seen visiting her lab frequently...\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Avrameow"
  POLITICS_BLAZING_SHEATH_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 3874 BLB\n\nFor centuries after the apparent death of Solar Flare, the squabbling of the different pony nation states grew, as they no longer had a unifying force in the ancient alicorns of old. Pegasi moved once again to their cloud cities, sealing off vital resources for the earth pony farmers; the earth ponies refused to pay tribute to the unicorns, who in turn lashed out and sacked swaths of land as retribution for starving many of their communities.\n\nInto this chaos was born Blazing Sheath. Little is known of her past, for she is just as mysterious as the great goddess that she serves. Living initially almost five thousand years ago, Blazing Sheath was raised in a small village that was long lost to the sands of time. Precious few scraps are understood beyond that.\n\nSometime after reaching adulthood, she encountered a priestess of the Solaris Perditionem. At least twice in the past different prophetesses had arisen to lead the cult to attempt to resurrect their hibernating Solar Flare, but to no avail. When she met this priestess, it was to be a fateful day, for she soon learned the true gifts of her fiery abilities.\n\nWhile she had spent some time working with smithing tools for unicorn soldiers, she eventually stopped, disappearing entirely from her life with her family and in the greater region. Years passed, and she reappeared in the ancient Bales region, leading a secret sect of ponies who attempted to bring back the spirit of Solar Flare. It was to no avail, as its location was hard to hide in the grand library of the city. In the aftermath of the fight, she took her last few surviving members and fled north, to an ancient temple housing Solar Flare's body.\n\nPursued, she sacrificed herself to curse the ponies who would dare try to destroy her goddess, trapping her own soul in the catacombs of the temple. Now, resurrected to serve again Solar Flare, she is prepared to lead the armies of the undead cultists against all those who dare oppose the alicorn. Whether for vengeance for the years she lost to her family, or for a devotion to the sun goddess remains unseen. Traces of her descendants' past occasionally come to light, and she has gathered inklings of one who lives in the Solar Empire.\n\nYet not even familial status will stop her. For in her own words: \"Solar Flare is light, and light must always purify the darkness from the world.\""

  the_end_of_all_things_desc:0 "As the morning, We are inevitable. Soon the flames of destruction will wash over this cursed world. We are the herald of its salvation. Death has come for you. Do not resist its call."
  victory_through_planning:0 "Victoriam per Consilio"
  victory_through_planning_desc:0 "Nebula Flare is meticulous and patient, as she spent far too long being hampered by Daybreaker when she was in the Solaris Adoratio. As a general, she spends far more time going through plans and potentialities than leading directly, and her troops are always well-prepared, if somewhat inflexible."
  mechanicus_deus:0 "Mechanicus Acolyte"
  mechanicus_deus_desc:0 "A member of the Mechanicus Deus of the Bales Technocracy. As a pony dedicated to the all-powerful Knowledge Spark, they learn faster than the average pony. New techniques frequently spring up on the field of battle that they implement to full effect."
  ancient_cultist:0 "Solaris Perditionem Priestess"
  ancient_cultist_desc:0 "Mysterious and ancient, this pony is literally out of time. One of the resurrected members of Solar Flare's ancient Solaris Perditionem cult, this pony channels their leader's aggression above all else. They have little time to learn the new ways of the world, and happily sacrifice hordes of soldiers under them to the meat grinder of battle."
  flame_master:0 "Flame Master"
  flame_master_desc:0 "Born in the ancient region of Sennistin, Purple Haze was inducted into the Solaris Perditionem during one of the final attempts to revive her goddess, Solar Flare. Like her fellow priestess, Blazing Sheath, she sacrificed herself rather than be captured by the foes of the cleansing light. Resurrected by her goddes, she gleefully leads the charge against the rebellious world that has greeted her."
  prophetess_of_death:0 "Prophetess of Death"
  prophetess_of_death_desc:0 "As a pony from the ancient past of Equestria, Blazing Sheath barely has a care for the soldiers under her command. Used to being obeyed by her lessers, she has little care for the life of the soldiers she now leads into battle. After all, they are worthy of punishment, too, and there is no better way to judge both sides than letting them kill each other en masse."
  timeless_fury:0 "Timeless Fury"
  timeless_fury_desc:0 "For millennia, Blazing Sheath sat in isolation only learning snippets of what the outside world accomplished. With every new piece of information she learned, her distaste for the opulence, the debauchery, and the irreverence to Solar Flare grew. Now unleashed as Solar Flare's supreme general, she has more than enough ponies to use to exact her own brand of punishment. Who cares if a few guilty get killed along the way?"
