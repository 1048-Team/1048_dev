  POLITICS_FH_KING_KLOSEU:0"§YBorn:§! 11th of January, 937 ALB in Kissau\n\n§YBiography:§!First and sole ruler of the Kingdom of Brodfeld, King Kloseu di Kissau has been a monolithic force guiding the small it for close to eighty years. Many griffons have lived their entire lives under his claw, with a not insignificant number born, living, and dying of old age while he remained on the throne.\n\nIn his youth, he was instructed by the best tutors that money could buy during the Empire's golden age to learn everything a young prince would need. Much like the polarizing Grover IV, Kloseu was popular with the lower classes and when he succeeded to the throne in 963 ALB and later elected as the ruling prince of the remaining region of Sydia, his social policies and economic reforms ensured Brodfeld prospered despite the crumbling empire around it.\n\nHowever, not all was well with his rule, and after a famine in 995 ALB and later economic disaster, his rule became more autocratic, until he used his authority to declare a state of emergency, which the kingdom has remained in ever since. After a failed assassination left him cradling his dead wife, tensions boiled over into a bloody civil war in 1005, which lasted a decade. Only through desperate aid were the communists crushed, and he secured his rule against all sympathizers—including his son, Tomado—with mass arrests and executions.\n\nUnder his reign, Brodfeld has stood strong against the communist threat, as he has brutally massacred any vocal resistance to his rule as communist rebellions. With the threat of Marelandia, he has convinced the nearby griffon nations to band together with the kingdom as its head. Although he has prodded numerous times into the Marelandia's sphere, it has mostly kept them at bay, instead of destroying them outright. Many of his social reforms have been repealed, and he has instituted an almost religious hatred of communism within the nation, which has slowly spread to his neighbors. Despite being over a century old, his vitality is no less sapped. Rumors about he has formed a pact with Maar for extended life, while others believe he is blessed by Boreas to be a shield against socialism. Whatever is the truth, he has made on thing clear: until communism has been wiped off the face of Griffonia, his work will never be finished.\n\n§YPortrait By:§! Scroup"
