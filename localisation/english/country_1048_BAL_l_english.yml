  POLITICS_COBALT_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: March 26th, 983 ALB\n\n§YBiography§!: The First-Citizen and Party-Governor of the South-Eastern Governorate, Cobalt Hoof has made a name for himself as the Guardian of the Revolution, and the spawn of all good in the region. Despite this, not much is truly known about his past. \n\nBecoming the Minister of Infrastructure upon the victory of the Governorate against the Solar Empire, he'd become a leading figure in the revolution against the Marksists in 1025. \nDeclaring himself the leader of the new revolutionary government, he began the purging of traitors, transforming the country into a Brutalist Utopia where all are truly equal, and foreign invaders dare not to trample the people. \n\nFor the Freedom to Love Cobalt is Absolute. \nThe Freedom to Laugh at the Enemy is Absolute. \nThe Freedom to Serve is Absolute. \n\n§YPortrait By§!: cotton-art"

  ###Ideas###
  BAL_no_recognition:0 "International Isolation"
  BAL_no_recognition_desc:0 "Ever since 1041 when Marelandia withdrew their support the Governorate has lacked recognition by any existing nation, with their entire existence ignored on most maps. \nNo diplomats arrive or depart, and traders are far and few between, forcing the country to try and rely on its own resources, much to no avail."
  BAL_red_glory:0 "Red Glory"
  BAL_red_glory_desc:0 "Upon the ashes of Tenochtitlan arose Red Glory.\nA pure example of the First Citizen's desire for Brutalism, its many complexes and skyscrapers portray a grand manifestation of concrete and glass, with much of the old demolished for the new. \nA sign of the glorious future, it has become the cultural staple of the Governorate, even if it has failed to pacify the tribes."
  BAL_imminent_war:0 "Imminent Collapse"
  BAL_imminent_war_desc:0 "The South-Eastern Governorate from its very inception has had little stability. \nFollowing the disastrous Anti-Insurgency Campaign, the country sees itself on the brink of collapse between various factions. \n\nTo the west lies the National Redemption Front, a militia of former Equestrian Military Remnants dedicated to opposing MARESOC and re-establishing Equestria under a Constitutional Monarchy. \nA thorn in the governments side for decades, its recent offensives have forced the government out of much of the jungle.\nPirates on the coast roam free, and camp revolts across the sea have become worringyly frequent. \nTo make matters worse the Neighua and Thestral populations have begun to fight eachother once more, with the New Baltimare government powerless to stop them. \n\nCombined with a devastated economy, failing military, and increasing dissidence from within the party itself, if the situation is not stabilized immediately §Ra complete collapse is inevitable.§!"
  BAL_party_conflict:0 "Party Conflict"
  BAL_party_conflict_desc:0 "The Inner Party from an outside perspective may seem unified, but this couldn't be further from the case. \n\nCobalt's position as Party-Governor is threatened by the 'Contender', who sees Marelandia's polticies to be too moderate for survival, and that individuality must be abolished for true equality. \nAnti-Marelandian Opposition is itself beginning to become rampant, with the so-called 'New Reds' arguing that the purge of Marksists is what brought the country to near-collapse, and that a counter-purge is neccasarry for its continued existence. \n\nTo purge either side would result in the parties complete collapse, so Cobalt must play his cards carefully to ensure his eventual death does not cause the §Rcountries disintergration.§!"
  BAL_collapsed_economy:0 "Devastated Economy"
  BAL_collapsed_economy_desc:0 "The economy is in a state of near constant collapse due to serious mismanagement by the government. If action is not taken to revitilize the industrial sector the country risks being far too weak to withstand the hoards of the [3.Owner.GetName]."
  ###EVENTS###
  southeast.1.t: "Birthday Preparations" 
  southeast.1.d: "It was that time of the year once again. Soon, it would be Cobalt's birthday, and the entire nation would celebrate in the resounding glory of their leader. At least, that would be what the Ministry of Truth would print. \nIt was far too dangerous for him to go out in public anymore, not to mention the mayhem the Outer Party could cause. \nHe would still celebrate it, of course, it was one of the few things that made him happy after all, but it would need to be within the complexes halls, and only with those he trusted the most. \n\nPerhaps the Contender and a few of those 'New Reds' could be invited as well to ease tensions? A couple represenatives from Nidhogg wouldn't cause any harm, either, and maybe he could finally eliminate Lucky Star without causing any suspicion...before he could finish his trail of thought, however, a pounding headache came upon him, forcing him into a kneeling position with agonizing pain.\nDespite how much he had rejected it, his illness had become worse, impacting his ability to do much of anything. \nWould inviting so many even be fruitful?"
  southeast.1.a: "Surely it wouldn't be harmful to invite a few more ponies!"
  southeast.1.b: "Maybe it isn't the wisest idea..."
