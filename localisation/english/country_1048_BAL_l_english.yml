  POLITICS_COBALT_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 26th of March, 983 in Baltimare\n\n§YBiography§!: The First-Citizen and Party-Governor of the South-Eastern Governorate, Cobalt Hoof has made a name for himself as the Guardian of the Revolution, and the spawn of all good in the region. Despite this, not much is truly known about his past. \n\nBecoming the Minister of Infrastructure upon the victory of the Governorate against the Solar Empire, he'd become a leading figure in the revolution against the Marksists in 1025. \nDeclaring himself the leader of the new revolutionary government, he began the purging of traitors, transforming the country into a Brutalist Utopia where all are truly equal, and foreign invaders dare not to trample the people. \n\nFor the Freedom to Love Cobalt is Absolute. \nThe Freedom to Laugh at the Enemy is Absolute. \nThe Freedom to Serve is Absolute. \n\n§YPortrait By§!: cotton-art"

  ###Ideas###
  BAL_no_recognition:0 "International Isolation"
  BAL_no_recognition_desc:0 "Ever since 1041 when Marelandia withdrew their support, the Governorate has lacked recognition from any existing nation, resulting in its absence on most maps. \nNo diplomats arrive or depart, and traders are few and far between, forcing the country to try and rely on its own resources, much to no avail."
  BAL_red_glory:0 "Red Glory"
  BAL_red_glory_desc:0 "Upon the ashes of Tenochtitlan arose Red Glory.\nA pure example of the First Citizen's desire for Brutalism, its many complexes and skyscrapers portray a grand manifestation of concrete and glass, with much of the old demolished for the new. \nA sign of the glorious future, it has become the cultural staple of the Governorate, even if it has failed to pacify the tribes."
  BAL_imminent_war:0 "Imminent Collapse"
  BAL_imminent_war_desc:0 "The South-Eastern Governorate from its very inception has had little stability. \nFollowing the disastrous Anti-Insurgency Campaign, the country sees itself on the brink of collapse between various factions. \n\nTo the south lies the National Redemption Front, a militia of former Equestrian Military Remnants dedicated to opposing MARESOC and re-establishing Equestria under a Constitutional Monarchy. \nA thorn in the government's side for decades, its recent offensives have forced the government out of much of the jungle.\nPirates on the coast roam free, and camp revolts across the sea have become worryingly frequent. \nTo make matters worse the Neighua and Thestral populations have begun to fight each other once more, with the New Baltimare government powerless to stop them. \n\nCombined with a devastated economy, failing military, and increasing dissidence from within the party itself, if the situation is not stabilized immediately §Ra complete collapse is inevitable.§!"
  BAL_party_conflict:0 "Party Conflict"
  BAL_party_conflict_desc:0 "The Inner Party from an outside perspective may seem unified, but this couldn't be further from the case. \n\nCobalt's position as Party-Governor is threatened by the 'Contender', who sees Marelandia's polticies to be too moderate for survival, and that individuality must be abolished for true equality. \nAnti-Marelandian Opposition is itself beginning to become rampant, with the so-called 'New Reds' arguing that the purge of Marksists is what brought the country to near-collapse, and that a counter-purge is necessary for its continued existence. \n\nTo purge either side would result in the party's complete collapse, so Cobalt must play his cards carefully to ensure his eventual death does not cause the §Rcountry's disintergration.§!"
  BAL_collapsed_economy:0 "Devastated Economy"
  BAL_collapsed_economy_desc:0 "The economy is in a state of near constant collapse due to serious mismanagement by the government. If action is not taken to revitalize the industrial sector the country risks being far too weak to withstand the hordes of the [3.Owner.GetName]."
  BAL_collapsed_economy_1:0 "Devastated Economy"
  BAL_collapsed_economy_1_desc:0 "The economy is in a state of near constant collapse due to serious mismanagement by the government. If action is not taken to revitalize the industrial sector the country risks being far too weak to withstand the hordes of the [3.Owner.GetName]."
  BAL_buggy_trade:0 "STT Treaty Member"
  BAL_buggy_trade_desc:0 "As a consequence of accepting the treaty offered by a group of one of [BUG.GetNameDef]'s largest trade companies, we have agreed to lease out Yukka Island to the bugs. This port has been used to expand their trade influence into Zebrica, but in turn has helped stave off bankrupty.\n\nIt'd be nice to have that island back, though."
  ###EVENTS###
  southeast.1.t:0 "Everything is on Fire"
  southeast.1.d:0 "Nobody truly remembered the days of the Great Revolution. After all, it was something he had made sure of. \nYet Cobalt had held onto his memories, despite the haziness developing around them: a revolution against the tyranny of Celestia, corrupted by the vile Stallionists who knew nothing of strategy nor of governance. \nIt was they who had launched the failed assault on Baltimare, they who forced us into the jungles! Yet we, like angels from the sky, lifted the revolution from its lowest point, and brought it to victory!\n\nYet his dream had been ruined.\nLooking upon the large swaths of grey from the balcony of the towering Governmental Complex, Cobalt had been left wondering what exactly went wrong.\nNew Baltimare was the Brutalist Utopia of his dreams, yet its beautiful sights were not enough to calm his worries.\nHe was no idiot: ever since the treacherous Marelandians refused support, the country had been struggling.\nIf it had only impacted the proles, there’d be no cause for concern, yet whispers from even the Inner Party were becoming ever apparent. The constant insurgencies didn’t help alleviate a thing, and he had his hoof forced to sell Yukka to the pathetic changelings.\n\nBut what would wallowing in sorrow do for the party?\nMoving himself away from the balcony, the stallion marched steadfast towards his quarters with determination he had not experienced in a long time.\nNo matter what the traitors wished, no matter what the insurgents fought for, no matter the constant headaches, Cobalt swore to bring the South-East back to its former glory.\n\nTo bring COBSOC back to its rightful place."
  southeast.1.a:0 "''...I swear my life on it.''"
  southeast.2.t:0 "A Talk with the Rosy Mayor"
  southeast.2.d:0 "The telephone was an amazing invention, pioneered by the First Citizen himself.\nAn instrument upon which the sounds of those miles apart could be conveyed through a simple device, why, it was simply genius!\nOf course, it came with certain...consequences.\n\n''All I am saying, First Citizen, is that you simply cannot ask me kindly. If you expect respect, you must respect me!''\n''You are a valued part of the Inner Party, of course we respect you. We simply cannot divert more funds to your proj-''\n''Yet you can divert funds towards your own! We were once the bastion of stability, we once had the most prosperous economy in the South East, yet your regime fucked us all over! If you seriously think that I, Lucky Star, will simply shut my opinions up because you asked kindly, you’ve got another thing coming!''\nLetting off a deep, prolonged sigh, Cobalt slowly put the handset back in its holding position, collapsing onto his chair.\n\nLucky Star had always been difficult to walk with, yet never were they truly this bad. \nIf he had the power to, he’d make sure the so-called “Rosy Mayor” was ten hooves under, yet every attempt to take their life resulted in complete failure.\nEverything in this country did.\nNo matter how hard Cobalt had tried, everything failed. He’d succeed in the end, it was the only way things could go, yet at times he couldn’t help but wish he could strangle the traitors himself.\n\nThe telephone would do, though."

  southeast.3.d:0 "DATE FILED: [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHour]                                             FILED BY: F.G LAST RAY\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nInsert Report about operations going better than in the past. That's not saying much. "
