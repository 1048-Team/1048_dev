  BAL_no_recognition:0 "International Isolation"
  BAL_no_recognition_desc:0 "Ever since 1041 when Marelandia withdrew their support the Governate has lacked recognition by any existing nation, with their entire existence ignored on most maps. \nNo diplomats arrive or depart, and traders are far and few between, forcing the country to try and rely on its own resources, much to no avail."
