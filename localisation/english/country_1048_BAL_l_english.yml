  POLITICS_COBALT_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: March 26th, 983 ALB\n\n§YBiography§!: The First-Citizen and Party-Governor of the South-Eastern Governorate, Cobalt Hoof has made a name for himself as the Guardian of the Revolution, and the spawn of all good in the region. Despite this, not much is truly known about his past. \n\nBecoming the Minister of Infrastructure upon the victory of the Governorate against the Solar Empire, he'd become a leading figure in the revolution against the Marksists in 1025. \nDeclaring himself the leader of the new revolutionary government, he began the purging of traitors, transforming the country into a Brutalist Utopia where all are truly equal, and foreign invaders dare not to trample the people. \n\nFor the Freedom to Love Cobalt is Absolute. \nThe Freedom to Laugh at the Enemy is Absolute. \nThe Freedom to Serve is Absolute. \n\n§YPortrait By§!: cotton-art"

  ###Ideas###
  BAL_no_recognition:0 "International Isolation"
  BAL_no_recognition_desc:0 "Ever since 1041 when Marelandia withdrew their support, the Governorate has lacked recognition from any existing nation, resulting in its absence on most maps. \nNo diplomats arrive or depart, and traders are few and far between, forcing the country to try and rely on its own resources, much to no avail."
  BAL_red_glory:0 "Red Glory"
  BAL_red_glory_desc:0 "Upon the ashes of Tenochtitlan arose Red Glory.\nA pure example of the First Citizen's desire for Brutalism, its many complexes and skyscrapers portray a grand manifestation of concrete and glass, with much of the old demolished for the new. \nA sign of the glorious future, it has become the cultural staple of the Governorate, even if it has failed to pacify the tribes."
  BAL_imminent_war:0 "Imminent Collapse"
  BAL_imminent_war_desc:0 "The South-Eastern Governorate from its very inception has had little stability. \nFollowing the disastrous Anti-Insurgency Campaign, the country sees itself on the brink of collapse between various factions. \n\nTo the west lies the National Redemption Front, a militia of former Equestrian Military Remnants dedicated to opposing MARESOC and re-establishing Equestria under a Constitutional Monarchy. \nA thorn in the government's side for decades, its recent offensives have forced the government out of much of the jungle.\nPirates on the coast roam free, and camp revolts across the sea have become worryingly frequent. \nTo make matters worse the Neighua and Thestral populations have begun to fight each other once more, with the New Baltimare government powerless to stop them. \n\nCombined with a devastated economy, failing military, and increasing dissidence from within the party itself, if the situation is not stabilized immediately §Ra complete collapse is inevitable.§!"
  BAL_party_conflict:0 "Party Conflict"
  BAL_party_conflict_desc:0 "The Inner Party from an outside perspective may seem unified, but this couldn't be further from the case. \n\nCobalt's position as Party-Governor is threatened by the 'Contender', who sees Marelandia's polticies to be too moderate for survival, and that individuality must be abolished for true equality. \nAnti-Marelandian Opposition is itself beginning to become rampant, with the so-called 'New Reds' arguing that the purge of Marksists is what brought the country to near-collapse, and that a counter-purge is necessary for its continued existence. \n\nTo purge either side would result in the party's complete collapse, so Cobalt must play his cards carefully to ensure his eventual death does not cause the §Rcountry's disintergration.§!"
  BAL_collapsed_economy:0 "Devastated Economy"
  BAL_collapsed_economy_desc:0 "The economy is in a state of near constant collapse due to serious mismanagement by the government. If action is not taken to revitalize the industrial sector the country risks being far too weak to withstand the hoards of the [3.Owner.GetName]."
  ###EVENTS###
  southeast.1.t: "Birthday Preparations" 
  southeast.1.d: "It was that time of the year once again. Soon, it would be Cobalt's birthday, and the entire nation would celebrate in the resounding glory of their leader. At least, that would be what the Ministry of Truth would print. \nIt was far too dangerous for him to go out in public anymore, not to mention the mayhem the Outer Party could cause. \nHe would still celebrate it, of course, it was one of the few things that made him happy after all, but it would need to be within the complexes halls, and only with those he trusted the most. \n\nPerhaps the Contender and a few of those 'New Reds' could be invited as well to ease tensions? A couple represenatives from Nidhogg wouldn't cause any harm, either, and maybe he could finally eliminate Lucky Star without causing any suspicion...\nBefore he could finish his trail of thought, however, a pounding headache came upon him, which forced him onto his knees as agony shot through his body.\nDespite how much he had rejected it, his illness had become worse, impacting his ability to do much of anything. \nWould inviting so many even be fruitful?"
  southeast.1.a: "Surely it wouldn't be any harm to invite a few more ponies!"
  southeast.1.b: "Maybe this isn't the wisest idea..."
  southeast.3.t: "Silence in the Complex"
  southeast.3.d: "Being a member of the Inner Party brought a plethora of benefits yet it still did not excuse you from guard duty, as the young stallion had to learn the hard way. It wasn't all bad, of course, and he much preferred to stand around than deal with whatever propaganda the Ministry of Truth spouted out, but it still brought a sense of inferiority only those within the lower party had to experience. \nDutifully serving Cobalt was his duty, yet he couldn't help but wish the uniform was at least comfortable.\n\nThinking for a second, he wondered just what Cobalt was doing within his room. After all, it wasn't like him to stay indoors all day, even with the weakness and paranoia he seemed to have. \nThe thought then dawned upon him, prompting him to barge through the doors and scream at the top of his lungs: \n''Party-Governor, are you alright?!''" \n\nYet no reply came."
  southeast.3.a: "And the silence was broken with screams."

  convene_party_desc:0 "No matter how much propaganda the Ministry of Truth prints out, those within the Inner Party know just how dire the situation is. \nWe barely control our own country, with large swaths of land in total anarchy. It's only a matter of time before we experience a complete collapse. \nWe must convene the party, and ensure this does not happen!"
  everything_is_shit:0 "Everything is on Fire"

  hold_talks_desc:0 "If we want to ensure that our party does not collapse, it may be necessary to speak with those who oppose us. \nWhat's the worst that could happen?"
  Reign_Party:0 "Survey the Outer Party"
  Reign_Party_desc:0 "In our society, there are three social castes: the Proles, the Outer Party, and the Inner Party. Although we could easily ignore the Proles, the Outer Party holds a plethora of opposition groups with the power and resources to threaten our already fragile regime. \nPerhaps it's time to teach them who truly rules these lands."
  SOLIDFY_NOW:0 "Cobalt Sees All"
  SOLIDFY_NOW_desc:0 "Cobalt is our Leader. \nCobalt is our First Citizen, and Party-Governor. \nCobalt Watches with a Thoughtful yet Stern Eye. \nCobalt Protects Us from the Imperialistic Capitalists. \n§RCobalt Sees All.§!"

  mane_snorts_cocaine:0 "Aris Controls All"
  mane_snorts_cocaine_desc:0 "Even a dictator must have his keys to the nation, and it seems that Cobalt's keyholder is the contender to his rule in the first place. \nAris Mane is a threat not only to Cobalt's rule, but the survival of Marelandian Socialism as a whole, and her radical ideology must be clamped down on."
  insanity_ensues:0 "The Valleys Speak Equuish"
  insanity_ensues_desc:0 "The National Redemption Front is a collection of ex-military ponies who wish to overthrow our government, and re-establish Equestria under a Constitional Monarchy. \nWith recent offenses striking deeper into our land, they've started to become problematic for our regime, and must be dealt with as soon as possible."
  insanity_ensues_pt2:0 "The Trees Screech"
  insanity_ensues_pt2_desc:0 "The Thestrals, out of fear of severe repression by the Solarists, sided with our revolution. It seems their trust of us has run out, however, as every day reports of missing shipments at night increases drastically. They're no better than the tribes, and must be shown their place."
  time_ticks:0 "The Clock Ticks Down"
  time_ticks_desc:0 "The clock is ticking down. If all has gone according to plan, a party election for the next Party-Governor shall commence. \nOf course the only option shall be hand-picked by Cobalt, as he knows what's best for the people."
