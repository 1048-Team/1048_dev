 SINISTER_DEMENTED_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! 974 ALB\n\nBorn to lowly farmers in the former Severnaya region of Equestria, Sinister Serov has reached heights never believed by all who knew him. In 1007 ALB, when the general secretary of the fledgling Stalliongrad state, Altydaya, resigned due to health issues, he swayed the voting members of the Supreme Soviet and replaced her, immediately implementing rapid levels of industrialization to put Stalliongrad on a course of eventually liberating the workers of Equestria from the oppressive capitalist bourgeoise.\n\nThrough dragging the primitive farmers and the still teetering industrial capacity of Stalliongrad into the 11th century, he achieved something that his peers not thought possible: challenging their former homeland's production might. Subsidies and mass-collectivization, the failing food supplies burgeoned to feed the hungry mouths of hundreds of thousands of soldiers willing to march to the gates of Tartarus to free their oppressed comrades.\n\nWhen Equestria was on the brink of stabilization against the changeling horde of Western Equus, Sinister realized his opportunity to strike, and he declared war on the struggling nation. At first, early successes fed his growing personality cult, but soon he snagged on the reborn Solar Empire. With his forces ground to a halt, he eventually created a stalemate by holding the river line north of Manehattan and establishing the first of his Shield of Steel buffer states.\n\nIn the aftermath of his failed liberation, other members of the Supreme Soviet began to question his rule, chief among them former ally Vasiliy Pentushenko. Within months, many former friends and supporters turned traitors, arrested and sentenced to death in the first purge of Stalliongrad.\n\nWith another two failed liberation wars under his belt, Sinister has let Stalliongrad grow into an industrial powerhouse, but one that is beginning to falter. Over the last several years, his mind has begun to cloud, and his orders muddled and confused. A series of strokes has left him weakened and a shadow of the great mind he once was. Sometimes reduced to raving and incoherent babbling, the great Father of the Workers' Liberation is nothing more than a feeble old stud, soon to leave behind nothing but a house of cards.\n\n§YPortrait By:§!
