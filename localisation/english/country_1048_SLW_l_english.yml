  ###Leader Descriptions###
  POLITICS_1048_MIDWINTER_HALO_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: February 11th, 985 ALB\n\n§YBiography§!: For most of her life, Midwinter Halo has served Daybreaker faithfully as one of the first-generation inquisitors that helped to establish the Solar Empire. As a foal, she lived in one of the estates near Canterlot to one of the minor noble families who served in Celestia's day court. She would make numerous trips to Canterlot to experience the high life in Canterlot Castle, and she met Celestia numerous times before attending school.\n\nWhen the Great War broke out in 1011, she volunteered to serve as one of the various military officers that Equestria desperately needed. By this point, she had already become known for her harsh demeanor against other nobles, especially those of the Corona family, and she applied much of her same aggressive tactics to warfare.\n\nIn the chaos that ensued after Daybreaker's ascension, she ultimately stayed loyal to the throne and followed to the pits of the worst fighting that anypony could envision. After displaying some of her talent for fire magic, Daybreaker promoted her laterally, from major to inquisitor, one of the first mages of the Solar Empire to root out heresy and keep the country safe from internal threats.\n\nAs years passed, she slowly worked her way to archmage status after she led a small band of inquisitors to squash a growing rebel cell near the border with the Principality of Central Equestria. Her skill from her years as a noble in court also gave her decent administrative ability, which moved her in her later years to general oversight of Inquisitionis movements.\n\nWith Daybreaker gone, the throne of the Empire now lays empty, and Midwinter has taken it upon herself to lead in her stead. Pragmatic and ruthless, she has the backing of most of the Solar Cult for the time being, she has already expressed her disinterest in complete control. She is the pony the Empire needs, but not the one it deserves.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
  POLITICS_1048_NOVA_GLOW_SLW_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: August 25th, 1018 ALB\n\nWhile not the most talented of mages of the Solaris Inquisitionis, Nova Glow replaces it with general competency and a ruthless desire to see Daybreaker honored. An orphan from the Southeast's war of independence, she was raised in a household that resisted the order that Daybreaker had set up. Yet this only drove her resolve of anti-heresy further, which in turn fueled eventual punishment from her adoptive family.\n\nIn 1029, she was able to finally alert the Inquisitionis to her family and turned them in herself, as she brought Ordo Multi inquisitors to her abode. Only a single member escaped, and she was soon seen as a potential devotee of the cult, which led to placement in one of the religious schools in Manehattan.\n\nAfter showing enough promise to be sent to Daybreaker's school for training mages and archmages, she reached her limit, barely passing and receiving a stationing back in Ordo Multi. Under its newest archmage, Nebula Flare, she learned some more abilities while practicing physical warfare with her fellow mage, Aurora Shinespark.\n\nAs a fairly reserved pony, she grew close with Nebula before her mentor fled as an exposed heretic, which pushed Nova further into her drive to eliminate it. Aurora was made archmage in Nebula's stead, leaving Nova with the same rank she held before, something that niggled her for years.\n\nIn the civil war with Equestria, Nova proved herself capable as a general, and unwholly loyal to Daybreaker. Now as the Prefectess of the Solar Empire, she has been tasked with filling the shoes of her God-Empress in guiding the Empire to new heights. Yet coming on the heels of an omnipotent, omniscient goddess is a massive task, and it remains to be seen if she can handle the pressure.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

  ###Midwinter Civil War Tree###
  SLW_light_unperceived:0 "Light Unperceived"
  SLW_light_unperceived_desc:0 "It is our own fault. We failed to see the signs of heresy building throughout the Empire. Now, with our Empress gone, what hope do we have left? A last, desperate fight for Order will be how we treat our enemies and we must find somepony to fill those shoes quickly."
  SLW_keeping_the_crown_jewel:0 "Keeping the Crown Jewel"
  SLW_keeping_the_crown_jewel_desc:0 "Manehattan has been one of the centers of the Empire, and now that we have lost Sanctum Solar to rebellion, it is our de facto capital. Focusing further on it will leave it in a better position if we win this war and will also aid us in the coming battles."
  SLW_force_them_to_work:0 "Force Them to Work"
  SLW_force_them_to_work_desc:0 "Why should ponies worry about shift times, fair labor, or breaks when there is a war for survival going on? Anypony seen abandoning their jobs will be treated like a coward running from battle: with a bullet to the back of their head."
  SLW_service_absolves_heresy:0 "Service Absolves Heresy"
  SLW_service_absolves_heresy_desc:0 "Promising convicts, vagabonds, and heretics that they will be freed upon the conclusion of this war if they fight for us will allow us to press further bodies into service. Of course, we're lying. Nopony earns forgiveness after the crimes they committed. Nopony."
  SLW_emergency_restructuring:0 "Emergency Restructuring"
  SLW_emergency_restructuring_desc:0 "When Daybreaker was... killed, the heretics that took power arrested almost all of the various heads of government were arrested or turned sides. [SLW.GetLeader] is doing her best, but she is one mare and requires assistance. Thankfully there are many faithful in Manehattan who can fill the roles needed."
  SLW_conscript_the_adoratio_militias:0 "Conscript the Inquisitionis Militias"
  SLW_conscript_the_adoratio_militias_desc:0 "While the Militarium is the primary military defense of the Empire, the Inquisitionis and even the Adoratio kept reserves of paramilitary forces. Now it is time to call upon them, whether they wish to go to the front lines or not."
  SLW_redeemed_by_the_praetorians:0 "Saved by the Praetorians"
  SLW_redeemed_by_the_praetorians_desc:0 "By a stroke of Daybreaker's holy mane, a chunk of the Praetorian guard survived and escaped to the Empire. Now their commander, Thundering Hoofbeat has stepped in to provide his expertise. These veterans fighting by our sides will cause the heretics to tremble and give our soldiers a much-needed boon to their morale."
  SLW_an_unexpected_surprise:0 "An Unexpected Arrival"
  SLW_an_unexpected_surprise_desc:0 "Nopony made it out of Sanctum Solar. Not one. However, somepony dressed as an archmage is demanding to see [SLW.GetLeader]. She claims she needs to see somepony from Sanctum Solar to calm down. And about three glasses of wine."
  SLW_imperial_sanctity:0 "Imperial_sanctity"
  SLW_imperial_sanctity_desc:0 "These last few months have proven that we are not a pushover to the heretics. Every inch of this country is holy ground, and we will not see it defiled by their presence. Not one step back further will be tolerated. Not one!"
  SLW_ensure_the_loyalty_of_the_militarium:0 "Ensure Militarium Loyalty"
  SLW_ensure_the_loyalty_of_the_militarium_desc:0 "Heresy was and probably still is rampant throughout the Militarium. It's time we remind them that they are not above a culling every now and then."
  SLW_end_the_false_empress:0 "Death to the False Goddess!"
  SLW_end_the_false_empress_desc:0 "Celestia is not our goddess! She never was. She was weak, ineffective, and the one who spawned much evil into this world. All those who follow her are nothing but insects which we must eradicate from our homeland. Nothing less will please the memory of Daybreaker. Sol Invicta!"
  
  ###Opening Nova Tree###
  SLW_glowing_corpse:0 "Glowing Corpse"
  SLW_glowing_corpse_desc:0 "The Imperium Civil Was has ended. We have won. But what at what cost?"
  SLW_ease_minds:0 "Ease Their Minds"
  SLW_ease_minds_desc:0 "Although the immediate threat of the civil war has ended, many faithful are rightfully terrified of the coming months. Our Empress is dead, and the false goddess Celestia has taken her place to spout mockeries and heresies to anypony who comes near her. The Prefectess must calm everypony quickly, lest more violence breaks out and leaves us defenseless."
  SLW_tenuous_control:0 "Tenuous Control"
  SLW_tenuous_control_desc:0 "Many ponies within the Militarium willfully sided with the false goddess to fight against us in the name of "freedom" and "harmony." What is left of it has already expressed their distaste that they were not consulted with choosing a successor to Daybreaker. As their new head, it is up to the Prefectess to keep them in line, especially as more dissent appears to be growing."
  SLW_teetering_edge:0 "Teetering on the Edge"
  SLW_teetering_edge_desc:0 "To say that the civil war was decimating on our economy would be an understatement. Many factories were destroyed and infrastructure was shredded thanks to Harmonist activity. And that was before the frontlines began to clash. Our economists have assessed the damage, and not one is around to present it after their worried, hasty exit out of a tenth story window after they finished."
  SLW_status_quo:0 "Return to the Status Quo"
  SLW_status_quo_desc:0 "Sanctum Solar has been the capital of the Empire since its inception, and the ancestral head of ponykind since Equestria was formed. Now that the war is over, many nobles that survived have already returned to the city, and are begging for us to return proper governance there. There is little reason to disappoint them."
  SLW_compromise_location:0 "Compromise on a Central Location"
  SLW_compromise_location_desc:0 "Both Sanctum Solar and Manehattan have been vying for their location to be chosen for the new Imperial capital, and it would lead to unfortunate unrest if one was chosen over the other. However, there is a third option. Fillydelphia remained loyal and is roughly halfway between Sanctum Solar and Manehattan, so there is no reason why it cannot be chosen instead."
  SLW_faithful_city:0 "Reward the Faithful City"
  SLW_faithful_city_desc:0 "Manehattan was our de facto capital while we fought in this vicious war. It has remained fairly undamaged from the fighting, and is the best location to permanently establish our new government. While many of the nobles can complain and whine about it, a majority of the city's populace supports this idea, and we should bless them for staying loyal to the Empress."
  SLW_execute_ringleaders:0 "Execute the Ringleaders"
  SLW_execute_ringleaders_desc:0 "When Celestia slew Daybreaker, it was a dog whistle for every other Harmonist who resided within the Empire to come out of the woodwork and be a thorn in our side. However, this is a double-edged sword, as we have captured a majority of the rebels that have plagued us for years. We have a special place for them in the heretic pyre."
  SLW_everypony_mourn:0 "Everypony Must Mourn"
  SLW_everypony_mourn_desc:0 "In the last few months there has not been proper time to hold ceremony for Daybreaker, which has caused growing despair and anger in the faithful. A midday vigil is being planned in Manehattan, Fillydelphia, and Sanctum Solar, along with numerous other towns and villages. Everypony must mourn our Empress, for her light has gone out in the world. There isn't even a body to inter."
  SLW_everypony_to_daybreaker:0 "Point Them All to Daybreaker"
  SLW_everypony_to_daybreaker_desc:0 "The Prefectess has been incredibly stressed this past while, and she has finally turned to the Adoratio and Inquisitionis for help. Together, they have started to draft new ideas for government, the first of which leaving all final matters up to prayer and divination from the Empress. She will solve all the problems, even now, beyond the grave."
  SLW_continue_fight:0 "Continue the Fight"
  SLW_continue_fight_desc:0 "Despite the pressure of the last few months, Prefectess Nova Glow has weathered it well. In fact, she has taken to it admirably, with a regal air to her. Even with the damage the nation is still recovering from, she has laid out her intentions to push us to victory, one dead heretic at a time."
  
  ###Shared Political Tree###
  SLW_witch_hunts:0 "Encourage Further Witch Hunts"
  SLW_witch_hunts_desc:0 "Ponies are angry, that much is clear. The civil war ripped this nation apart and exposed old wounds that had festered for far too long. For the last several weeks many of the faithful have taken it upon themselves to enact judgement of those who are suspected Harmonists. So it's been prevented from getting out of hoof, by why should we stop them doing our work for us?"
  SLW_jumpstart_economy:0 "Jumpstart with some Heat"
  SLW_jumpstart_economy_desc:0 "There is no reason why production levels are so low, except for one thing: slothfulness. In the chaos, many ponies have banded together to demand improved "workers rights" and the like. We will give them an ultimatum: return to work, or be shot. It would be one less pony to feed."
  SLW_scrutinize_cult:0 "Scrutinize the Cult"
  SLW_scrutinize_cult_desc:0 "There have been dissenting voices within the Adoratio and Inquisitionis regarding the appointment of the Prefectess. On top of that, the only reason that heresy was allowed to get out of hoof so easily must have been because of traitors in its midst. There msut be a cleansing at once, lest the Prefectess suffers the same fate as Daybreaker."
  SLW_fund_speculatores:0 "Further Fund the Speculatores"
  SLW_fund_speculatores_desc:0 "Obviously one of the shortcomings in the Empire was that the Solaris Speculatores, our elite intelligence agency, was not provided enough money to properly observe every detail prior. The new head, Subdacta Lux, has contacted the Prefectess regarding such matters, with the promises of rich rewards."
  SLW_expand_praetorians:0 "Expand the Praetorian Guard"
  SLW_expand_praetorians_desc:0 "Only the Praetorian Guard had the loyalty and wherewithal to stay pure to the Empress. For that they shall be rewarded. While they were once part of the Militarium, they are their own separate branch, answerable only to the Prefectess and their commander, Thundering Hoofbeat. Further support will swell their numbers, until they can protect the Prefectess no matter where she goes."
  SLW_observe_everypony:0 "Observe Everypony"
  SLW_observe_everypony_desc:0 "The Speculatores have already put the additional financing to good use, and greatly enlarged our network of informants, contacts, and remote surveillance spell matrices. In some way, shape, or form, everypony in the Empire is now being watched. Surely none of them have anything to hide, do they?"
  SLW_execute_false_empress:0 "Execute the False Goddess"
  SLW_execute_false_empress_desc:0 "It was with exceeding travail that we were able to capture the one who perpetrated all this. Princess Celestia has been rotting in our cells for months now, but we finally have the capacity to enforce her sentence. For the murder of the God-Empress, there is only one verdict: death."

As she is descended from one of the many noble houses of Sanctum Solar, she frequently meddles in things beyond her purview. With her hooves in so many pies, she tends to keep a charisma about her that is able to distract from her true intentions. That doesn't really lend well to a position as general, however, which hampers her units' offensive capabilities in battle."

A sub-branch of the Solaris Militarium, the Praetorian Guard acts completely autonomously from the rest of the Solar Empire's military and government, fully dedicated to their sole duty of protecting the Empress from harm. Only the most talented of soldiers are turned into a hulking Praetorian, and it requires true grit to rise to the top of them all."
