  ###Unit Leaders###
  
  ###Focuses###
  
  ###Midwinter Civil War Tree###
  SLW_light_unperceived:0 "Light Unperceived"
  SLW_light_unperceived_desc:0 "It is our own fault. We failed to see the signs of heresy building throughout the Empire. Now, with our Empress gone, what hope do we have left? A last, desperate fight for Order will be how we treat our enemies and we must find somepony to fill those shoes quickly."
  
  SLW_keeping_the_crown_jewel:0 "Keeping the Crown Jewel"
  SLW_keeping_the_crown_jewel_desc:0 "Manehattan has been one of the centers of the Empire, and now that we have lost Sanctum Solar to rebellion, it is our de facto capital. Focusing further on it will leave it in a better position if we win this war and will also aid us in the coming battles."
  
  SLW_force_them_to_work:0 "Force Them to Work"
  SLW_force_them_to_work_desc:0 "Why should ponies worry about shift times, fair labor, or breaks when there is a war for survival going on? Anypony seen abandoning their jobs will be treated like a coward running from battle: with a bullet to the back of their head."
  
  SLW_service_absolves_heresy:0 "Service Absolves Heresy"
  SLW_service_absolves_heresy_desc:0 "Promising convicts, vagabonds, and heretics that they will be freed upon the conclusion of this war if they fight for us will allow us to press further bodies into service. Of course, we're lying. Nopony earns forgiveness after the crimes they committed. Nopony."
  
  SLW_emergency_restructuring:0 "Emergency Restructuring"
  SLW_emergency_restructuring_desc:0 "When Daybreaker was... killed, the heretics that took power arrested almost all of the various heads of government were arrested or turned sides. [SLW.GetLeader] is doing her best, but she is one mare and requires assistance. Thankfully there are many faithful in Manehattan who can fill the roles needed."
  
  SLW_conscript_the_adoratio_militias:0 "Conscript the Inquisitionis Militias"
  SLW_conscript_the_adoratio_militias_desc:0 "While the Militarium is the primary military defense of the Empire, the Inquisitionis and even the Adoratio kept reserves of paramilitary forces. Now it is time to call upon them, whether they wish to go to the front lines or not."
  
  SLW_redeemed_by_the_praetorians:0 "Saved by the Praetorians"
  SLW_redeemed_by_the_praetorians_desc:0 "By a stroke of Daybreaker's holy mane, a chunk of the Praetorian guard survived and escaped to the Empire. Now their commander, Thundering Hoofbeat has stepped in to provide his expertise. These veterans fighting by our sides will cause the heretics to tremble and give our soldiers a much-needed boon to their morale."
  
  SLW_an_unexpected_surprise:0 "An Unexpected Arrival"
  SLW_an_unexpected_surprise_desc:0 "Nopony made it out of Sanctum Solar. Not one. However, somepony dressed as an archmage is demanding to see [SLW.GetLeader]. She claims she needs to see somepony from Sanctum Solar to calm down. And about three glasses of wine."
  
  SLW_imperial_sanctity:0 "Imperial_sanctity"
  SLW_imperial_sanctity_desc:0 "These last few months have proven that we are not a pushover to the heretics. Every inch of this country is holy ground, and we will not see it defiled by their presence. Not one step back further will be tolerated. Not one!"
  
  SLW_ensure_the_loyalty_of_the_militarium:0 "Ensure Militarium Loyalty"
  SLW_ensure_the_loyalty_of_the_militarium_desc:0 "Heresy was and probably still is rampant throughout the Militarium. It's time we remind them that they are not above a culling every now and then."
  
  SLW_end_the_false_empress:0 "Death to the False Goddess!"
  SLW_end_the_false_empress_desc:0 "Celestia is not our goddess! She never was. She was weak, ineffective, and the one who spawned much evil into this world. All those who follow her are nothing but insects which we must eradicate from our homeland. Nothing less will please the memory of Daybreaker. Sol Invicta!"

  SLW_steadfast_on_holy_ground_desc:0 "The Empire is sacred. Everypony will lay down their lives to hold onto every inch of ground we gain. Only through blood will the heretics take it back."

  ###Unit Leader Traits###
  career_archmage:0 "Career Archmage"
  career_archmage_desc:0 "Seething Corona has been the archmage of Ordo Solis since its inception. As she is descended from one of the many noble houses of Sanctum Solar, she frequently meddles in things beyond her purview. With her hooves in so many pies, she tends to keep a charisma about her that is able to distract from her true intentions. That doesn't really lend well to a position as general, however, which hampers her units' offensive capabilities in battle."
  praetorian_guard_commander:0 "Praetorian General"
  praetorian_guard_commander_desc:0 "The current commander of the elite Praetorian Guard of Sanctum Solar. A sub-branch of the Solaris Militarium, the Praetorian Guard acts completely autonomously from the rest of the Solar Empire's military and government, fully dedicated to their sole duty of protecting the Empress from harm. Only the most talented of soldiers are turned into a hulking Praetorian, and it requires true grit to rise to the top of them all."
  giant_stick:0 "Hulking Brute"
  giant_stick_desc:0 "A fanatical loyalist to Daybreaker, Thundering Hoofbeat ensures that his entire command is tasked with defending her and the Empire at all costs, for as long as they need. The magics used to give him his incredible strength have hampered some of his higher preservation instincts, and he has no issue performing the same failed tactics again and again until they work."
