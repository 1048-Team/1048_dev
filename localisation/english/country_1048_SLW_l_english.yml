  ###Leader Descriptions###
  POLITICS_1048_MIDWINTER_HALO_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: February 11th, 985 ALB\n\n§YBiography§!: For most of her life, Midwinter Halo has served Daybreaker faithfully as one of the first-generation inquisitors that helped to establish the Solar Empire. As a foal, she lived in one of the estates near Canterlot to one of the minor noble families who served in Celestia's day court. She would make numerous trips to Canterlot to experience the high life in Canterlot Castle, and she met Celestia numerous times before attending school.\n\nWhen the Great War broke out in 1011, she volunteered to serve as one of the various military officers that Equestria desperately needed. By this point, she had already become known for her harsh demeanor against other nobles, especially those of the Corona family, and she applied much of her same aggressive tactics to warfare.\n\nIn the chaos that ensued after Daybreaker's ascension, she ultimately stayed loyal to the throne and followed to the pits of the worst fighting that anypony could envision. After displaying some of her talent for fire magic, Daybreaker promoted her laterally, from major to inquisitor, one of the first mages of the Solar Empire to root out heresy and keep the country safe from internal threats.\n\nAs years passed, she slowly worked her way to archmage status after she led a small band of inquisitors to squash a growing rebel cell near the border with the Principality of Central Equestria. Her skill from her years as a noble in court also gave her decent administrative ability, which moved her in her later years to general oversight of Inquisitionis movements.\n\nWith Daybreaker gone, the throne of the Empire now lays empty, and Midwinter has taken it upon herself to lead in her stead. Pragmatic and ruthless, she has the backing of most of the Solar Cult for the time being, she has already expressed her disinterest in complete control. She is the pony the Empire needs, but not the one it deserves.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
  POLITICS_1048_NOVA_GLOW_SLW_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: August 25th, 1018 ALB\n\nWhile not the most talented of mages of the Solaris Inquisitionis, Nova Glow replaces it with general competency and a ruthless desire to see Daybreaker honored. An orphan from the Southeast's war of independence, she was raised in a household that resisted the order that Daybreaker had set up. Yet this only drove her resolve of anti-heresy further, which in turn fueled eventual punishment from her adoptive family.\n\nIn 1029, she was able to finally alert the Inquisitionis to her family and turned them in herself, as she brought Ordo Multi inquisitors to her abode. Only a single member escaped, and she was soon seen as a potential devotee of the cult, which led to placement in one of the religious schools in Manehattan.\n\nAfter showing enough promise to be sent to Daybreaker's school for training mages and archmages, she reached her limit, barely passing and receiving a stationing back in Ordo Multi. Under its newest archmage, Nebula Flare, she learned some more abilities while practicing physical warfare with her fellow mage, Aurora Shinespark.\n\nAs a fairly reserved pony, she grew close with Nebula before her mentor fled as an exposed heretic, which pushed Nova further into her drive to eliminate it. Aurora was made archmage in Nebula's stead, leaving Nova with the same rank she held before, something that niggled her for years.\n\nIn the civil war with Equestria, Nova proved herself capable as a general, and unwholly loyal to Daybreaker. Now as the Prefectess of the Solar Empire, she has been tasked with filling the shoes of her God-Empress in guiding the Empire to new heights. Yet coming on the heels of an omnipotent, omniscient goddess is a massive task, and it remains to be seen if she can handle the pressure.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

  ###Midwinter Civil War Tree###
  SLW_light_unperceived:0 "Light Unperceived"
  SLW_light_unperceived_desc:0 "It is our own fault. We failed to see the signs of heresy building throughout the Empire. Now, with our Empress gone, what hope do we have left? A last, desperate fight for Order will be how we treat our enemies and we must find somepony to fill those shoes quickly."
  SLW_keeping_the_crown_jewel:0 "Keeping the Crown Jewel"
  SLW_keeping_the_crown_jewel_desc:0 "Manehattan has been one of the centers of the Empire, and now that we have lost Sanctum Solar to rebellion, it is our de facto capital. Focusing further on it will leave it in a better position if we win this war and will also aid us in the coming battles."
  SLW_force_them_to_work:0 "Force Them to Work"
  SLW_force_them_to_work_desc:0 "Why should ponies worry about shift times, fair labor, or breaks when there is a war for survival going on? Anypony seen abandoning their jobs will be treated like a coward running from battle: with a bullet to the back of their head."
  SLW_service_absolves_heresy:0 "Service Absolves Heresy"
  SLW_service_absolves_heresy_desc:0 "Promising convicts, vagabonds, and heretics that they will be freed upon the conclusion of this war if they fight for us will allow us to press further bodies into service. Of course, we're lying. Nopony earns forgiveness after the crimes they committed. Nopony."
  SLW_emergency_restructuring:0 "Emergency Restructuring"
  SLW_emergency_restructuring_desc:0 "When Daybreaker was... killed, the heretics that took power arrested almost all of the various heads of government were arrested or turned sides. [SLW.GetLeader] is doing her best, but she is one mare and requires assistance. Thankfully there are many faithful in Manehattan who can fill the roles needed."
  SLW_conscript_the_adoratio_militias:0 "Conscript the Inquisitionis Militias"
  SLW_conscript_the_adoratio_militias_desc:0 "While the Militarium is the primary military defense of the Empire, the Inquisitionis and even the Adoratio kept reserves of paramilitary forces. Now it is time to call upon them, whether they wish to go to the front lines or not."
  SLW_redeemed_by_the_praetorians:0 "Saved by the Praetorians"
  SLW_redeemed_by_the_praetorians_desc:0 "By a stroke of Daybreaker's holy mane, a chunk of the Praetorian guard survived and escaped to the Empire. Now their commander, Thundering Hoofbeat has stepped in to provide his expertise. These veterans fighting by our sides will cause the heretics to tremble and give our soldiers a much-needed boon to their morale."
  SLW_an_unexpected_surprise:0 "An Unexpected Arrival"
  SLW_an_unexpected_surprise_desc:0 "Nopony made it out of Sanctum Solar. Not one. However, somepony dressed as an archmage is demanding to see [SLW.GetLeader]. She claims she needs to see somepony from Sanctum Solar to calm down. And about three glasses of wine."
  SLW_imperial_sanctity:0 "Imperial Sanctity"
  SLW_imperial_sanctity_desc:0 "These last few months have proven that we are not a pushover to the heretics. Every inch of this country is holy ground, and we will not see it defiled by their presence. Not one step back further will be tolerated. Not one!"
  SLW_ensure_the_loyalty_of_the_militarium:0 "Ensure Militarium Loyalty"
  SLW_ensure_the_loyalty_of_the_militarium_desc:0 "Heresy was and probably still is rampant throughout the Militarium. It's time we remind them that they are not above a culling every now and then."
  SLW_end_the_false_empress:0 "Death to the False Goddess!"
  SLW_end_the_false_empress_desc:0 "Celestia is not our goddess! She never was. She was weak, ineffective, and the one who spawned much evil into this world. All those who follow her are nothing but insects which we must eradicate from our homeland. Nothing less will please the memory of Daybreaker. Sol Invicta!"
  
  ###Opening Nova Tree###
  SLW_glowing_corpse:0 "Glowing Corpse"
  SLW_glowing_corpse_desc:0 "The Imperium Civil Was has ended. We have won. But what at what cost?"
  SLW_ease_minds:0 "Ease Their Minds"
  SLW_ease_minds_desc:0 "Although the immediate threat of the civil war has ended, many faithful are rightfully terrified of the coming months. Our Empress is dead, and the false goddess Celestia has taken her place to spout mockeries and heresies to anypony who comes near her. The Prefectess must calm everypony quickly, lest more violence breaks out and leaves us defenseless."
  SLW_tenuous_control:0 "Tenuous Control"
  SLW_tenuous_control_desc:0 "Many ponies within the Militarium willfully sided with the false goddess to fight against us in the name of "freedom" and "harmony." What is left of it has already expressed their distaste that they were not consulted with choosing a successor to Daybreaker. As their new head, it is up to the Prefectess to keep them in line, especially as more dissent appears to be growing."
  SLW_teetering_edge:0 "Teetering on the Edge"
  SLW_teetering_edge_desc:0 "To say that the civil war was decimating on our economy would be an understatement. Many factories were destroyed and infrastructure was shredded thanks to Harmonist activity. And that was before the frontlines began to clash. Our economists have assessed the damage, and not one is around to present it after their worried, hasty exit out of a tenth story window after they finished."
  SLW_status_quo:0 "Return to the Status Quo"
  SLW_status_quo_desc:0 "Sanctum Solar has been the capital of the Empire since its inception, and the ancestral head of ponykind since Equestria was formed. Now that the war is over, many nobles that survived have already returned to the city, and are begging for us to return proper governance there. There is little reason to disappoint them."
  SLW_compromise_location:0 "Compromise on a Central Location"
  SLW_compromise_location_desc:0 "Both Sanctum Solar and Manehattan have been vying for their location to be chosen for the new Imperial capital, and it would lead to unfortunate unrest if one was chosen over the other. However, there is a third option. Fillydelphia remained loyal and is roughly halfway between Sanctum Solar and Manehattan, so there is no reason why it cannot be chosen instead."
  SLW_faithful_city:0 "Reward the Faithful City"
  SLW_faithful_city_desc:0 "Manehattan was our de facto capital while we fought in this vicious war. It has remained fairly undamaged from the fighting, and is the best location to permanently establish our new government. While many of the nobles can complain and whine about it, a majority of the city's populace supports this idea, and we should bless them for staying loyal to the Empress."
  SLW_execute_ringleaders:0 "Execute the Ringleaders"
  SLW_execute_ringleaders_desc:0 "When Celestia slew Daybreaker, it was a dog whistle for every other Harmonist who resided within the Empire to come out of the woodwork and be a thorn in our side. However, this is a double-edged sword, as we have captured a majority of the rebels that have plagued us for years. We have a special place for them in the heretic pyre."
  SLW_everypony_mourn:0 "Everypony Must Mourn"
  SLW_everypony_mourn_desc:0 "In the last few months there has not been proper time to hold ceremony for Daybreaker, which has caused growing despair and anger in the faithful. A midday vigil is being planned in Manehattan, Fillydelphia, and Sanctum Solar, along with numerous other towns and villages. Everypony must mourn our Empress, for her light has gone out in the world. There isn't even a body to inter."
  SLW_everypony_to_daybreaker:0 "Point Them All to Daybreaker"
  SLW_everypony_to_daybreaker_desc:0 "The Prefectess has been incredibly stressed this past while, and she has finally turned to the Adoratio and Inquisitionis for help. Together, they have started to draft new ideas for government, the first of which leaving all final matters up to prayer and divination from the Empress. She will solve all the problems, even now, beyond the grave."
  SLW_continue_fight:0 "Continue the Fight"
  SLW_continue_fight_desc:0 "Despite the pressure of the last few months, Prefectess Nova Glow has weathered it well. In fact, she has taken to it admirably, with a regal air to her. Even with the damage the nation is still recovering from, she has laid out her intentions to push us to victory, one dead heretic at a time."
  
  ###Shared Political Tree###
  SLW_witch_hunts:0 "Encourage Further Witch Hunts"
  SLW_witch_hunts_desc:0 "Ponies are angry, that much is clear. The civil war ripped this nation apart and exposed old wounds that had festered for far too long. For the last several weeks many of the faithful have taken it upon themselves to enact judgement of those who are suspected Harmonists. So it's been prevented from getting out of hoof, by why should we stop them doing our work for us?"
  SLW_jumpstart_economy:0 "Jumpstart with some Heat"
  SLW_jumpstart_economy_desc:0 "There is no reason why production levels are so low, except for one thing: slothfulness. In the chaos, many ponies have banded together to demand improved "workers rights" and the like. We will give them an ultimatum: return to work, or be shot. It would be one less pony to feed."
  SLW_scrutinize_cult:0 "Scrutinize the Cult"
  SLW_scrutinize_cult_desc:0 "There have been dissenting voices within the Adoratio and Inquisitionis regarding the appointment of the Prefectess. On top of that, the only reason that heresy was allowed to get out of hoof so easily must have been because of traitors in its midst. There msut be a cleansing at once, lest the Prefectess suffers the same fate as Daybreaker."
  SLW_fund_speculatores:0 "Further Fund the Speculatores"
  SLW_fund_speculatores_desc:0 "Obviously one of the shortcomings in the Empire was that the Solaris Speculatores, our elite intelligence agency, was not provided enough money to properly observe every detail prior. The new head, Subdacta Lux, has contacted the Prefectess regarding such matters, with the promises of rich rewards."
  SLW_expand_praetorians:0 "Expand the Praetorian Guard"
  SLW_expand_praetorians_desc:0 "Only the Praetorian Guard had the loyalty and wherewithal to stay pure to the Empress. For that they shall be rewarded. While they were once part of the Militarium, they are their own separate branch, answerable only to the Prefectess and their commander, Thundering Hoofbeat. Further support will swell their numbers, until they can protect the Prefectess no matter where she goes."
  SLW_observe_everypony:0 "Observe Everypony"
  SLW_observe_everypony_desc:0 "The Speculatores have already put the additional financing to good use, and greatly enlarged our network of informants, contacts, and remote surveillance spell matrices. In some way, shape, or form, everypony in the Empire is now being watched. Surely none of them have anything to hide, do they?"
  SLW_execute_false_empress:0 "Execute the False Goddess"
  SLW_execute_false_empress_desc:0 "It was with exceeding travail that we were able to capture the one who perpetrated all this. Princess Celestia has been rotting in our cells for months now, but we finally have the capacity to enforce her sentence. For the murder of the God-Empress, there is only one verdict: death."
  
  ###Nova Empress Tree###
  SLW_declare_heretics:0 "Declare All Opposed as Heretics"
  SLW_declare_heretics_desc:0 "Many of the layponies have decried Nova's desire to increase military preparedness before recovering entirely from the civil war. They are clearly against the will of Daybreaker, and must be silenced. A few heresy charges will end opposition in short order."
  SLW_inquisitionis_kneel:0 "Make the Inquisitionis Kneel"
  SLW_inquisitionis_kneel_desc:0 "Not even the Inquisitionis is free from dissent. Nova's decrees have stirred up some within the ranks to question whether she is still fit to lead as Prefectess. Pondering the ability of the Empress's chosen is pure heresy. These inquisitors must be broken, or they will be executed."
  SLW_dissolve_government:0 "Dissolve the Imperial Cabinet"
  SLW_dissolve_government_desc:0 "What did the cabinet ever do for us? They delayed and stalled, adding more red tape than was needed to stymie any attempts at passing laws without the Empress's direct power. They have no use for us now, as ultimate power lies in the Prefectess, who always knows what is best."
  SLW_purify_adoratio:0 "Purify the Militias"
  SLW_purify_adoratio_desc:0 "The Adoratio helps maintain and organize various militia groups of faithful ponies across the Empire. But they have been tainted, as heretics and harmonists have slipped into the ranks to corrupt it from within. We must rip the chaff out, before we have to destroy the entire Ordo to keep it pure."
  SLW_cleanse_inquisitors:0 "Cleanse Rebellious Inquisitors"
  SLW_cleanse_inquisitors_desc:0 "Despite every chance of receiving mercy, there are some inquisitors who believe that Nova is attempting to usurp Daybreaker's place as the goddess of all ponies. That is absurd! She only seeks to keep the Empire together, through any means. These voices must be silenced. Permanently."
  SLW_above_all:0 "One Head Above All"
  SLW_above_all_desc:0 "The weakness of the Adoratio and Inquisitionis was its separation. Sunset led the Adoratio, while Quasar Pulse was an entirely autonomous underling. In correcting the errors of the past, Nova Glow will place this heavy burden on herself. It is her Daybreaker-given right, after all."
  SLW_puppet_diet:0 "Install a Puppet Diet"
  SLW_puppet_diet_desc:0 "The Prefectess may be absolute, but establishing a small council that she can "converse" with will provide a stronger backing for her decrees. This will be made of her most loyal supporters. If somepony questions her, they will be shot, until an agreement is ratified. It sounds like a fair deal."
  SLW_some_live:0 "Allow Some to Live"
  SLW_some_live_desc:0 "There would be too much wasted talent to kill everypony who has doubts about the legitimacy of the Prefectess's mission. Nova has promised mercy to some, asking any who want restitution to meet with her so she can intercede on their behalf to the Empress that they may be returned to the fold."
  SLW_swear_new_oaths:0 "Swear New Oaths"
  SLW_swear_new_oaths_desc:0 ""For her mercy is great, her patience everlasting.\nWe are her sword and shield, we do not think of our own safety.\nOur salvation is bought with our blood, spilt for the Prefectess's will.\nPraise to her who speaks on our behalf to the God-Empress.\nSol Invicta, glory to Daybreaker.""
  SLW_bless_praetorians:0 "Bless the Praetorian Guard"
  SLW_bless_praetorians_desc:0 "Our loyal servants in the Praetorian Guard stood with us when nopony else would. That strength should be rewarded. The Prefectess promises that the Empress will give them great victory in the future, as she and they tie their futures together for the good of the Empire."
  SLW_silence_deniers:0 "Silence the Last Deniers"
  SLW_silence_deniers_desc:0 "It is a shame that Sunset and some of the other most talented inquisitors have steadfastly refused to cooperate with the Prefectess. It is no matter, they will be replaced eventually. We only wish that she could have seen the light of day."
  SLW_correct_misinformation:0 "Correct Misinformation"
  SLW_correct_misinformation_desc:0 "There is a remarkable amount of fake news being instructed in the schools. Daybreaker did not perish, she is still with us the whole time! This must be rectified immediately!"
  SLW_power_of_sun:0 "Show the Power of the Sun"
  SLW_power_of_sun_desc:0 "Ponies believed that the Forever Sun Celebration would never be seen again, but they were wrong. As we speak, the event planning is underway. It is promised that it will be the grandest, most extravegant yet, to show all that they mustn't fear for the future."
  SLW_new_empress:0 "The New Empress"
  SLW_new_empress_desc:0 "§RFor I am her and she is me. I am her and she is me. I AM HER AND SHE IS ME!§!"
  
  ###Nova Theocracy Tree###
  SLW_religious_exemption:0 "Religious Exemptions"
  SLW_religious_exemption_desc:0 "Many ponies have shown their true colors after the civil war, and we must find ways to differentiate between a potential heretic and a true follower of Daybreaker. To that end, new laws will be put in place that will be hheavily enforced. Anypony who doesn't swear immediate faith in Daybreaker will be cut off from society, where they can more easily be inspected for heresy."
  SLW_another_crusade:0 "Another Grand Crusade"
  SLW_another_crusade_desc:0 "Quasar Pulse has been nearly begging for the chance to lead inquisitors from her own private Ordo, Ordo Fidelum, on a hunt for anypony in Ordo Solis suspected of heresy. These inquisitors have been known to grow far too zealous and take justice into their own hooves in the field. They will be perfect to exact vengeance."
  SLW_merge_cults:0 "Merge the Two Cults"
  SLW_merge_cults_desc:0 "For decades the Solaris Adoratio and Inquisitionis have been in a strange relationship. Technically, they are one, but the former is led by the High Mage - who is in charge of both - and the latter is led de facto by the Lady Inquisitor. As these leaders have clashed in the past, it is time to do away with these barriers. Lady Inquisitor Quasar Pulse is just the pony for the job."
  SLW_replace_nobles:0 "Faithful Nobles"
  SLW_replace_nobles_desc:0 "The oldest of the aristocracy are those who have lived before and through the Great War. When Daybreaker awakened, she kept them as political pawns to give the appearance that she consulted with others before her laws were enacted. These nobles held little love for her, and it is time we repay them in kind by replacing them. With loyal puppets."
  SLW_oversee_command:0 "Oversee the High Command"
  SLW_oversee_command_desc:0 "Most generals are loyal. Most. There were, however, a number of talented ponies that secretly remained followers of Celestia, and we must ensure that future generations of generals do not fall prey to Harmony's lies."
  SLW_sanctified_unicorns:0 "Sanctified for the Empress"
  SLW_sanctified_unicorns_desc:0 "Blessed are the unicorns of the Empire, for they are the most favored of all creation. We must induct more of them into the Adoratio and Inquisitionis, so that we may truly protect the Empire from any threat. Every unicorn mare shall be recruited. They have no choice. It is their perfect sacrifice to Daybreaker."
  SLW_imperial_science:0 "Imperial Science"
  SLW_imperial_science_desc:0 "Clearly one of the reasons for why so many ponies fell to Celestia's Harmonist fables was because they were not educated in proper Imperial doctrine. Instructors and teachers of the laypony class have been given too much leniency; now they will be replaced with priestesses, who can properly guide our young and their impressionable minds."
  SLW_adoratio_primacy:0 "Adoratio Primacy"
  SLW_adoratio_primacy_desc:0 "As it is larger, the Solaris Adoratio should be given priority in government and furture policies. Through allocating more funding to it, we can inspire our populace to follow Daybreaker to the brink of death, with a priestess around every corner to push them to greatness."
  SLW_inquisitionis_primacy:0 "Inquisitionis Primacy"
  SLW_inquisitionis_primacy_desc:0 "Since the Inquisitionis is the branch that actually protects against heresy, we should allow it further priority than it already has in governmental decisions. How can they plausibly guard the Empire if they do not have an inquisitor to follow every single pony in the Empire, after all?"
  SLW_reignite_war_forges:0 "War Forges Reignited"
  SLW_reignite_war_forges_desc:0 "Many factories and smelteries have lain dormant since the end of the civil war. This is a crime against all of ponykind, for how are we to rebuild if we cannot defend ourselves? We shall dedicate everything to upping our production, beginning with new work shifts for the workers..."
  SLW_solarist_restored:0 "A Solarist Restored"
  SLW_solarist_restored_desc:0 "Sunset Shimmer and some of thsoe who were part of her quest to "save" Daybreaker have been observed and denied any restitution with the Solar Cult since the war has ended. However, there has been no worries from any of them regarding their loyalty, and it is time that they all take their places again, although Sunset will have to accept a lower rank than before."
  SLW_honor_eldest:0 "Honor the Eldest"
  SLW_honor_eldest_desc:0 "It is uncommon for age to be a signifier of respect in the Empire. But the savior of the Empire, Midwinter Halo, deserves recognition. As a faithful servant for many years, it is time that the Prefectess bless her with a unique position, to signify her importance to the Empire, forever."
  SLW_new_tithes:0 "Levy New Tithes"
  SLW_new_tithes_desc:0 "Ponies complain about taxes but they are, quite frankly, not extracted from enough! The Empire has expanded beyond its former needs after integrating the Cult, and to that end, more revenue is needed. We shall make a tithe for every single service, and then some, and it shall be an offer the laypony cannot refuse."
  SLW_empire_church:0 "The Church of the Solar Empire"
  SLW_empire_church_desc:0 ""Daybreaker, who art in Aetheria: Hallowed by thy name; thy Flame guide us; and your Holy Light provide wisdom to us.\nLead us in this new chapter of your Equestrian Empire, and empower our weapons that we may smite the heretic where they stand.\nProtect us as we carry out thy will!\nSol Invicta!""
  
  ###War Trees###
  SLW_awake_and_angry:0 "Awake and Angry"
  SLW_awake_and_angry_desc:0 "The former regions of the Empire have laughed at us for long enough. Their days are numbered, for we will engulf them in a firestorm that will leave none alive!"
  SLW_demonstrate_strength:0 "Demonstrate the Empress's Strength"
  SLW_demonstrate_strength_desc:0 "Nopony will expect it. While the traitors in the heartlands prepare their pathetic armies against us, we will strike at the heart of one rebellion: the birthplace of the communist revolution."
  SLW_adapt:0 "Adapt"
  SLW_adapt_desc:0 "Winters are harsh in the northern reaches of Stalliongrad, and our weapony was not intended to be used in such extreme conditions. As not much testing as been done, the matrices that power many of our vehicles could refuse to work or they could explode in their chambers. Extensive retrofitting will have to be done, and quickly, to ensure the Militarium is ready for Stalliongrad."
  SLW_overcome:0 "Overcome"
  SLW_overcome_desc:0 "[SLW.GetNameDefCap] will not fall prey to the wiles of the Stalliongradian environment. What do we need to prepare for, when we can simply level any resistance from a safe distance? Stalliongrad will fear the rumble of our guns before they are shelled into oblivion!"
  SLW_winter_spell_matrices:0 "Winterized Spell Matrices"
  SLW_winter_spell_matrices_desc:0 "In a not completely unexpected twist, our initial design alterations to fit Stalliongrad's were woefully inadequate for the harshest of the communists' winters. Therefore, further tinkering with the functionality of weapons and vehicles will be needed, including infusions with heat spells, and other ways to keep the crystals from shattering from the slightest bump in the cold."
  SLW_death_machines:0 "Machines of Death"
  SLW_death_machines_desc:0 "The open plains of southern Stalliongrad have proven the utility and practicality of our few battle tank designs, as they have swept across enemy lines and achieved multiple victories. We should further pursue this, while we have the chance to learn from Stalliongrad's own tank program."
  SLW_vaporize_wastes:0 "Vaporize the Snowy Wastes"
  SLW_vaporize_wastes_desc:0 "Everything can be solved by lobbing more shells at it. The ice and snow will be turned to slag so that we may cross Stalliongrad's plains and forests unopposed and decimate any resistance in our path."
  SLW_slice_STG_up:0 "Slice Off Stalliongrad's Head"
  SLW_slice_STG_up_desc:0 "One of Stalliongrad's strengths is its centralized command structure. One of its weaknesses is its centralized command structure. While the Militarium suffers from a similar blight, we can order strikes on rear lines in attempts to eliminating an army's commander, leaving their forces in disarry while we decapitate their forces in a precise attack."
  SLW_eradicate_evidence:0 "Eradicate Evidence of Communism"
  SLW_eradicate_evidence_desc:0 "Communism has been a blight on society since it was first conceived by Caramel Marks. Every statue, every building, every book that makes mention of this heretical doctrine will be destroyed, starting with the origin of it all: Caramel Marks' residence. Heavy resistance should be expected, but it will ponies saving us having to file paperwork for death warrants."
  SLW_plunder_lowlands:0 "Plunder the Lowlands"
  SLW_plunder_lowlands_desc:0 "Much wealth has been stored in the southern territories of Stalliongrad and its puppets. Much of that has been stolen from the Empire when Stalliongrad snatched the Prench region from us. It's time we returned the favor, and brought them all back into the fold while we take what is rightfully ours from their greedy hooves."
  SLW_mockers_and_heretics:0 "Mockers and Heretics"
  SLW_mockers_and_heretics_desc:0 "We are still surrounded by enemies on our southern borders. Two of the most egregious are [CLD.GetNameDef] and [CER.GetNameDef], who have proved nothing but thorns in our sides since they abandoned us. Now that we have proven our capability, it is time to dole out their reward: a slow and painful death."
  SLW_complete_idiots:0 "Fools Everywhere"
  SLW_complete_idiots_desc:0 "Anypony who does not submit to the will of the Empress is a blind fool, for how else could they be so stupid to go against her? Technocrats, communists, traitors; all of those we have in droves to our north, but they shall see a swift end at the hooves of our soldiers."
  SLW_lockdown_everypony:0 "Lockdown Everypony"
  SLW_lockdown_everypony_desc:0 "The level of tenacity that the wayward ponies we reclaimed resist us is unexpected. Every new territory must be locked down completely, so that the Militarium can have an easier time policing the populace until they have accepted their true masters. Anypony caught breaking quarantine shall be executed, as they have proved their heretical thoughts then and there."
  SLW_pacify_cities:0 "Pacify the Cities"
  SLW_pacify_cities_desc:0 "Due to our rapid reconquest, we have not had the time to properly garrison the various settlements and enforce Imperial law upon them. As there are a number of regions that are in open rebellion, there needs to be a simple and sure way to keep them in line, and we already have a target in mind."
  
  ###Post-war Coring Tree###
  SLW_heretics_everywhere:0 "Heretics Behind Every Bale"
  SLW_heretics_everywhere_desc:0 "Our returned territories were breeding grounds for sedition and heresy for a generation. There is no easy cure for something so corrupted and twisted, save by the purifying light of the Empress's Holy Flame."
  SLW_remove_heresy:0 "Surgically Remove Heresy"
  SLW_remove_heresy_desc:0 "While there is unfathomable numbers of heretics that have lived in the rump states surrounding us, there are others who are ambivalent or eager to be under our rule again. There is no need to be heavy-hoofed about punishment. After all, it is best we put the Solaris Speculatores to work every so often to sniff out true heresy."
  SLW_false_heresy:0 "Fabricate False Accusations"
  SLW_false_heresy_desc:0 "The search for heretics has turned up far fewer than we previously believed existed. This cannot be! Where are the droves of heretics, rebels, and partisans? We have promised the Empire blood for the suffering it received through these ponies' actions, and we will provide it. By any means necessary."
  SLW_topple_monuments:0 "Topple Their Monuments"
  SLW_topple_monuments_desc:0 "Ponies living outside the Empire had the gall to erect statues or dedicate buildings in honor of their own backstabbing "rulers" without rightfully acknowledging the Empress as the one who deserves all glory and worship. Every monument must be wiped out, lest they spread thoughts to other ponies to resist our rule."
  SLW_find_evidence:0 "Sniff Out Evidence"
  SLW_find_evidence_desc:0 "The heretics may be hidden, but few ponies can fully evade the combined efforts of the Solaris Speculatores and Inquisitionis. Snippets of conversation, occasional paper trails, or other inklings of secret cells are only the tip of the iceberg on what the faithful will search for. Nopony will escape us. Nopony."
  SLW_arrest_suspicious:0 "Arrest Anypony Suspicious"
  SLW_arrest_suspicious_desc:0 "As the embodiment of the Empress's law, the Inquisitionis has the right to detain anypony whom they deem to be suspected of heresy. Some of these ponies may resist, since they believe they have the right to a fair hearing. But when has that ever stopped us?"
  SLW_solar_lebensraum:0 "More Living Space for the Faithful"
  SLW_solar_lebensraum_desc:0 "Residing in our new lands are many creatures who are barely worth acknowledgement. Changelings, yaks, griffons, and of course heretical ponies themselves. These do not deserve the earth on which they sit. We shall send settlers to reclaim it, and if any of them resist, they will be executed on the spot. They never owned it, anyway."
  SLW_greatest_purge:0 "The Greatest Purge"
  SLW_greatest_purge_desc:0 "There has still not been enough cleansing to account for the believed heresy. We must dispense of any pretense: an order will go out to every inquisitor, every soldier. Wipe out a tenth of every settlement. We must nip any future heresy in the bud, here and now!"
  SLW_stamp_resistance:0 "Stamp out the Resistance"
  SLW_stamp_resistance_desc:0 "After months of searching, we can conclude that the actual number of heretical cells is far less than we believed, but that doesn't mean that we've come up empty. There are numerous in [CLD.GetNameDef]'s or [CER.GetNameDef]'s territory alone, and it will be more than enough to set examples for future conquests."
  SLW_adoratio_missionaries:0 "Missionaries from the Adoratio"
  SLW_adoratio_missionaries_desc:0 "There are so many who have not heard the good news of Daybreaker's salvation! This was one of the original intentions of the Solaris Adoratio to begin with, and it is now time to preach to the unwashed masses again! All will love the Empress as we do, and if they don't, they shall be sent to the Holy Flame to be purified forever."
  SLW_dominion_across_equus:0 "Dominion Across Equus"
  SLW_dominion_across_equus_desc:0 "We have achieved our end goal of integrating and pacifying the nations that broke from us decades ago. Heresy has subsided, and ponies have acknowledged [SLW.GetLeader]'s right to rule. It is time we turned our attention elsewhere: to the "nation" that started it all."
  
  ###Southeast Tree###
  SLW_pound_to_dust:0 "Pound Them To Dust"
  SLW_pound_to_dust_desc:0 "The first time we fought in the South-east, we were halted by the hit and run tactics of the different groups fighting for their "freedom." This time we have come prepared, and we will bring with us new ways to flatten their hideaways before they have a chance to strike at us."
  SLW_fight_like_bats:0 "Fight Like the Bats"
  SLW_fight_like_bats_desc:0 "Thestrals were part of the reason we were pushed back when Daybreaker led us into the penninsula before, using their unnatural crepuscular tendancies and maneuverability to poke out of remote jungle and mountain settlements and then slip away. We can take a page from their book, at least when it comes to fighting in disadvantageous terrain."
  SLW_rein_in_communists:0 "Rein in the Communists"
  SLW_rein_in_communists_desc:0 "A majority of the northern half of the South-east has succumbed to the lies and promises of [BAL.GetLeader]. MARESOC, Socialist, Markist, Sinisterist. They all spout untruths to get ponies to follow them and wander astray. Some well-placed executions will show what happens when ponies are deceived and willingly abandon the Empress."
  SLW_baltimares_end:0 "Baltimare's End, Finale"
  SLW_baltimares_end_desc:0 "Once the jewel of the South-east, Baltimare has fallen into disgrace as [BAL.GetLeader] has tightened the governemnt's control and given the entire city into its vices and ignorance. When we first came here, we almost leveled the city, but were pushed back by MARESOC's untimely arrival. We won't be stopped again."
  SLW_introduce_flame:0 "Introduce the Holy Flame"
  SLW_introduce_flame_desc:0 "The thestrals have been beaten back to their hovels and villages, where they cower in anticipation of their eternal punishment. Not a single creature of darkness shall be suffered to live. The Empress's Holy Flame will finally rid us of these accursed creatures of the Nightmare. Forever."
  SLW_defiant_no_longer:0 "Defiant No Longer"
  SLW_defiant_no_longer_desc:0 "Both under Baltimare's control, and now under our guidance, the southern half of the penninsula has remained stubbornly resistant to any attempts of occupation. It's time we turn up the heat, and flush out from the festering jungles these rebels and bring the region to heel."
  SLW_repair_mistakes:0 "Repair the Empire's Mistake"
  SLW_repair_mistakes_desc:0 "Ponies have argued for decades what started the Empire's decline. Most have argued that it was Celestia's failing that allowed the changelings to snatch half our territory, but if the South-east had not slipped away, we could have brought the bugs under boot much sooner. Today, the [GetNovaTitle] has righted this wrong and cemented herself in greatest of history!"
  
  ###CHN and CRY Tree###
  SLW_solarist_hegemony:0 "Solarist Hegemony"
  SLW_solarist_hegemony_desc:0 "We stand as one of the true superpowers of Equus again, and are close to retaking our lost territory from the cursed changelings. We only have a couple of roadblocks left in our way before we can declare complete dominance on the continent."
  SLW_repay_owed:0 "Repay What is Owed"
  SLW_repay_owed_desc:0 "The claim is it was by sheer luck that a passing patrol captured [CHN.GetName]'s Queen Chrysalis as she attempted to flee on hoof through one of the supply trains that have been going through Vesalipolis, but the [GetNovaTitle] knows better. By providence or fate, the scourge of the Empire has been delivered into our hooves. We mustn't waste this opportunity."
  SLW_suffer_slowly:0 "Let them Suffer, Slowly"
  SLW_suffer_slowly_desc:0 "Like our brethren that have been starved, beaten, and killed for the amusement of the changelings, we have intentions for our former oppressors. The Inquisitionis has been drafting up ways of utilizing them to their fullest extent, and it is sure to be painful. And when they beg for mercy, we will only give them the kiss of hard labor until they perish."
  SLW_new_monuments:0 "Crystal Monuments to the Empress"
  SLW_new_monuments_desc:0 "[CRY.GetNameDefCap] stabbed us in the back when we relied on their help in the Great War, and for that they shall have their collective memory erased. With a new degree, the [GetNovaTitle] has decreed that the entire city will be repurposed into a monument to the Empire, for all to look on and despair."
  SLW_homeland:0 "Homeland of Ponies"
  SLW_homeland_desc:0 "Despite the years, the land that the Hegemony had snatched from us remains our dejure territory, and it has yearned for our return for decades. With the liberation of our ensnared brethren, the land has already begun to heal, and we have begun integrating the various cities back into the Empire."
  SLW_waste_not:0 "Waste Not Want Not"
  SLW_waste_not_desc:0 "The Hegemony did not have time to scuttle their ships when we finally overran their territory and captured the shipyards of Ditrysium, and we now have a swelling of warships of all sizes, as well as a sizeable submarine flotilla. These may not be as intricate as ours, but we can't look a gift horse in the mouth, as it were."
  SLW_drill_depths:0 "Drill to the Depths of Tartarus"
  SLW_drill_depths_desc:0 "[CRY.GetNameDefCap] foolishly let much of its natural resources still rot in the ground instead of utilizing them. With our influx of fresh bodies after the war, there is ample opportunity to rectify that problem."
  SLW_new_territory:0 "A New Imperial Territory"
  SLW_new_territory_desc:0 "One of Equestria's many mistakes throughout its lifetime before the Great War, aside from humoring the ridiculous ideals of Harmony, was never formally annexing the Crystal Empire when it had ample opportunity to do so. If they had direct administrative control, perhaps the Great War would have turned out differently. However, the Crystal Ponies will not get the same liberties again."
  SLW_bug_land:0 "Snatch the Bugs' Land"
  SLW_bug_land_desc:0 "While we're here, we might as well take a bit more. Our ponies could use a smidgen more living room in the northern stretches of the Empire."
  SLW_equus_hegemony:0 "Hegemony Across Equus"
  SLW_equus_hegemony_desc:0 "It is not enough that we have toppled the changelings or corrected the wayward Crystal Empire. There are still those on Equus who do not bend the knee to the Empress and live in complete ignorance of their heresy and apostasy. We must bring the light of the sun to them all."
  
  ###EQC Tree###
  SLW_last_heresy:0 "The Final Heresy"
  SLW_last_heresy_desc:0 "At last, our situation on Equus is secured, and with that, we can direct our entire efforts toward the instigator of every ill that has occurred in this last half-century. [EQC.GetName] has been tolerated for too long, and they will be cleansed with the bright light of the Holy Flame."
  SLW_no_innocent:0 "Nopony is Innocent"
  SLW_no_innocent_desc:0 "Everypony from a young age in [EQC.GetName] has been brainwashed into believing the lies of the MARESOC and [EQC.GetLeader], so not a single pony is innocent and willing to aid us. If anypony seems open to our help, it is a trap, and we must react accordingly. The Militarium must shoot to kill. Always."
  SLW_setting_sun:0 "Setting of the Sun"
  SLW_setting_sun_desc:0 "It is fitting that MARESOC has never changed the name of Sunset, as it will be a monument to the destruction of their regime as we send it into the raging inferno of the evening sun!"
  SLW_crude_copy:0 "A Crude Copy"
  SLW_crude_copy_desc:0 "In an ultimate defiance of their predecessors, MARESOC has had the gall to the declare the former New Manehattan colony as the one and only Manehattan in the world. They have attempted to carve reconstructions of our greatest monuments there, but have failed miserably. They willl not live long to remember, however."
  SLW_dual_empress:0 "Dual-Prefectess"
  SLW_dual_empress_desc:0 "The last heretics have fallen. As we emerge victorious, we stand dominant over two great continents, and we can spread the might of the Empress to every nook and cranny of the world! There has been only one pony who has led us to this point, [GetNovaTitle] [SLW.GetLeader]. Praise to her, the dual-[GetNovaTitle]!"
  
  ###Communist Decisions Tree###
  SLW_meeting_devil:0 "Meeting with the Devil"
  SLW_meeting_devil_desc:0 "Among the communists' many, many demands, their leader, Smoldering Carbon, has requested to meet with the [GetNovaTitle] to discuss things in detail and in good faith. It is preposterious! The [GetNovaTitle] would never meet with scum like them! Do they wish to command the day while they are at it?"
  SLW_hear_their_side:0 "Hear Out the Other Side"
  SLW_hear_their_side_desc:0 "There have been many levelheaded requests and complaints from the communists, and even the ones that were voiced with more... passion carried strong points. We cannot just execute all of them, and the Empress had the wisdom to allow some tolerance. Perhaps we should send negotiators to the various outward groups and learn more."
  SLW_provide_audience:0 "Provide an Audience with Nova"
  SLW_provide_audience_desc:0 "Surprisingly, the [GetNovaTitle] has agreed to meet with Smoldering Carbon. Orders have been dispatched to prepare the grandest ceremonies, although even Nova Glow has admitted curiosity if this will impress, intimidate, or irritate Smoldering while meeting."
  SLW_safer_industry:0 "A Safer Industry"
  SLW_safer_industry_desc:0 "We could have simply wiped the communists and unions of the face of the planet, but the [GetNovaTitle] decided in her wisdom to allow them to be heard. Now their ideas have spread further, and we have no choice but to concede. This will at least buy us peace, but at what cost in the future?"
  SLW_never_negotiate:0 "Never Negotiate"
  SLW_never_negotiate_desc:0 "There is a simple policy in the Solar Empire from the Solaris Inquisitionis: never negotiate with terrorists and heretics. Each and every pony decrying the "unfairness" in the Empire has proven their disloyalty, and they have signed their own death warrants." 
  SLW_pulverize_protesters:0 "Pulverize the Protests"
  SLW_pulverize_protesters_desc:0 "We cannot allow further destablization of the Empire through these whelps' pity parties. By the end of the day, every garrison in the Militarium will be equipped and given instructions, and these protesters will be rounded up and arrested. Let us hope there's no spark of violence in any of them..."
  SLW_monitor_members:0 "Monitor the Members"
  SLW_monitor_members_desc:0 "There are thousands of members of various underground unions that have sprung to light, and while they have not technically committed any heretical acts, nor have they joined their fellows in dissent against the Empress, they must be observed. One wrong move, and they will wish they were never born."
  SLW_lob_heads:0 "Lob off the Heads"
  SLW_lob_heads_desc:0 "As of yet, there has not been definitive proof that Smoldering Carbon or others of her inner circle were behind some of the more violent protests, but evidence has surfaced through the Speculatores that she encouraged the ponies in Manehattan to rebel, just as much as Starlight and Trixie were involved. A raid will be conducted at once, and she will rue the day she thought she could outwit the Empress."
  
  ###Military Trees###
  SLW_traitors_in_midst:0 "Traitors in Our Midst"
  SLW_traitors_in_midst_desc:0 "There are many ponies who are not content with the new rule of the [GetNovaTitle]. These stradle the line between apostasy and heresy. We must rid them at once."
  
  ###Army Tree###
  SLW_imprison_sympathizers:0 "Imprison Any Sympathizers"
  SLW_imprison_sympathizers_desc:0 "Just because they didn't rebel with the other Harmonists doesn't mean that those left in the Militarium are innocent. A number of officers and soldiers have made suspicious comments. It is time they are removed before their heresy grows."
  SLW_try_blueblood:0 "Try Blueblood for Heresy"
  SLW_try_blueblood_desc:0 "When he was rescued, Blueblood was hardly thankful for the lives lost to free him from Celestia's imprisonment. In fact, he seemed rather comfortable in his quarters; far too comfortable. Combined with his penchant to criticize the [GetNovaTitle] there could be more than meets the eye."
  SLW_cleanse_ranks:0 "Cleanse the Upper Ranks"
  SLW_cleanse_ranks_desc:0 "It is not a secret that many of the remaining generals and officers in the Militarium have grown discontent with Nova's leadership and desire to reform and strengthen the Adoratio and Inquisitionis. Furthermore, a few have been seen meeting at odd times, and it must be decided to handle these outliers immediately."
  SLW_purify_troops:0 "Purify the Troops"
  SLW_purify_troops_desc:0 "Since there was so much confusion in the civil war, there were no doubt Harmonists that didn't desert the Militarium while we battled for our existence. It is time that the Militarium receive another cleanse of the enlisted. We can always replace them with more down the line."
  SLW_keep_militarium_command:0 "Keep the Militarium Command Style"
  SLW_keep_militarium_command_desc:0 "Despite its bloated bureaucracy, the Militarium has kept the Empire safe for the last few decades, and there is no reason we must completely gut it to remain safe from heresy. There may be a few inefficiences, but it's unquestionable that they get things done effectively when they do."
  SLW_modernize_supply_system:0 "Modernize the Supply System"
  SLW_modernize_supply_system_desc:0 "The Militarium desperately needs modernization, starting with how supplies and equipment are transferred between troops on the frontline. We don't even have proper military train lines to ensure the fastest route to our soldiers while at war. A restructuring is in order, at the blessing of the [GetNovaTitle]."
  SLW_praetorian_leadership:0 "Praetorian Leadership"
  SLW_praetorian_leadership_desc:0 "The Militarium is unfit to properly serve the Empire as it has been compromised again and again with heresy. There has been only one sub-branch that has remained loyal at all times, and they will whip them into shape. Lord Commander Praetorian Hoofbeat has a ring to it."
  SLW_loyalty_bred:0 "Loyalty Bred Through Education"
  SLW_loyalty_bred_desc:0 "When most ponies enter the Militarium for officer positions, they go through either Manehattan's or Sanctum Solar's academies. Until this point, not enough religious thought had been drilled into them, as they didn't consider the Empress's goals at all times. All new officers will require classes dedicated solely to learning the Empress's will. When they leave, they will never deviate from her desires ever again."
  SLW_armored_swarms:0 "Armored Swarms"
  SLW_armored_swarms_desc:0 "The Militarium has stayed firmly in the past when it has come to warfare. There may be many talented generals and commissioned officers, but what good is having a large military when most of it can be splattered across a battlefield in short order because there is no adequate protection. We shall implement combined warfare immediately."
  SLW_fully_mechanized:0 "Fully Mechanized Support"
  SLW_fully_mechanized_desc:0 "To achieve our goal of integrating tanks and other armored vehicles into main Militarium tactics instead of special operations, we will also require fully protected trucks and light infantry assault vehicles to transport our troops in the heat of battle with some level of security and ensure our supplies are not disrupted."
  SLW_point_blank:0 "Point-blank Bombardment"
  SLW_point_blank_desc:0 "Unprecedented times call for uncanny and odd tactics. For the majority of its existence, the Militarium has treated tanks as a special unit, never as a frontline assault force to charge straight at the enemy. But we have such large vehicles of destruction, why should we not use them to sow terror in the midst of enemy lines, even if it is more costly?"
  SLW_tank_wave:0 "Tank Wave Offensives"
  SLW_tank_wave_desc:0 "At this point, tanks and other armored weapons are like a standard trooper. Armor and other aspects of combined warfare have been fully integrated into our mass assault waves, leaving us as an unstoppable front that will roll over every heretic that stands against us!"
  SLW_endless_hordes:0 "Endless Hordes"
  SLW_endless_hordes_desc:0 "Since the Militarium's inception, the standard infantrypony has served the Empire as its premier form of defense. If we are to hope to face our enemies on the battlefield, we will need far more of them to overwhelm the opposition and bring them to their knees."
  SLW_streamlined_auxiliaries:0 "Streamlined Auxiliaries"
  SLW_streamlined_auxiliaries_desc:0 "Not all enlisted ponies must serve on the front lines, as with an expanded hoofprint on the battlefield, our armies will require significantly larger investments into support squads and equipment. Some of our commissioned officers must also now go to these efforts to organize the supply lines as well."
  SLW_figure_it_out:0 "The Soldiers Will Figure It Out"
  SLW_figure_it_out_desc:0 "Training takes time, a luxury that we don't have now that more bodies than ever are swelling our ranks to face anything that threatens the Empire. To that end, we will have to slacken our standards slightly. If they're able to shoot a gun, we can send them into battle. They'll figure the rest out soon enough."
  SLW_drown_in_blood:0 "Drowning the Enemy in Blood"
  SLW_drown_in_blood_desc:0 "Our reforms have ballooned the serving members of the Militarium to the point that we barely have enough room to fit them all in barracks and bases. When war inevitability comes, we will be ready, and the enemy shall drown in the holy blood of our soldiers!"
  SLW_praetorious_maximus:0 "Praetorious Maximus"
  SLW_praetorious_maximus_desc:0 "The Praetorian Guard is the elite fighting force of the Empire. While they used to be only for defensive purposes, we can work with Thundering Hoofbeat to carefully select more for other operations. They won't go through the magical binding process, but they can be used for sabotage or other covert efforts, such as securing beachheads with indiscriminate force."
  SLW_for_empress_and_country:0 "For Empress and Country"
  SLW_for_empress_and_country_desc:0 "The Empress was our purpose, and while she no longer is physically with us, we must always remember our promise: no matter how dire, no matter how difficult, the Militarium will prevail, and will protect the Empire. Praise Daybreaker! Praise the [GetNovaTitle]! Sol Invicta!"
  
  ###Navy Tree###
  SLW_scrape_barnacles:0 "Scrape the Barnacles Off"
  SLW_scrape_barnacles_desc:0 "There are numerous old and crusty admirals that make up the Militarium's naval branch. Most of them have somehow stuck around since before the Great War, and are nothing more than relics from bygone eras. Given that they have also spoken unkindly of the [GetNovaTitle], freshening the roster may be in order."
  SLW_punish_deserters:0 "Punishment for Desertion"
  SLW_punish_deserters_desc:0 "Half the Imperial fleet is still at large, run by those who wish to remain free of [GetNovaTitle] Nova Glow's rule as either apostates or heretics. They forget we have other means of reaching them, and if they will not be coerced back, then they shall be destroyed instead."
  SLW_no_civilian_sea:0 "No Civilians on the Sea"
  SLW_no_civilian_sea_desc:0 "We are in a state of perpetual emergency, and we are allowing fishers and traders to flitter about our waters without escorts or proper paperwork? These merchantponies and schooners may be light, but they can serve us well as replacements for the ships we had to scuttle in the purging of heresy, especially if they're refitted."
  SLW_refactored_roles:0 "Refactored Roles"
  SLW_refactored_roles_desc:0 "Screening vessels in earlier conflicts were quick, nimble, and could skirt in and out of combat range to provide protection for our heavier ships. But with fewer numbers than ever before, we have to punch above our weight in any potential engagements in the future. We shall rebuild them with heavier guns, all else be damned!"
  SLW_realign_doctrines:0 "Realign Imperial Doctrines"
  SLW_realign_doctrines_desc:0 "Standard Imperial policy was to have the largests ships take the brunt of the engagement and batter the enemy into submission. Those tactics have proved less than worthless as we have only constructed giant targets for base strikes. The age of the battleship is over, and in its place, we shall create a super-carrier worth of its mantle."
  SLW_innovate_upon_heretics:0 "Innovate Upon the Heretics"
  SLW_innovate_upon_heretics_desc:0 "Our naval carrier knowledge is woefully behind other nations that have adopted these long-range doctrines, but that doesn't mean we are without hope. Analyzing battles that have occurred elsewhere in the world since, especially from Hippogriffia, should give us ways to implement reforms. And we may add a few Solaris twists while we're at it."
  SLW_across_sea:0 "Reach Across the Sea"
  SLW_across_sea_desc:0 "Our carriers will be the envy of the world once we have completed our doctrine refinement. There will not be a single spot their wings cannot reach, which will let us strike fear into all heretics who dare oppose us!"
  SLW_fire_up_forges:0 "Fire Up the Forges"
  SLW_fire_up_forges_desc:0 "Factories still lie dormant while they could be used for something useful. An entire section of Fillydelphia is completely silent, all of its refinement sluicers wasted when they could be utilized for something productive. It is time we give them a reason to be used again, and dedicate them to rebuilding our crippled navy."
  SLW_double_down:0 "Double Down on Tradition"
  SLW_double_down_desc:0 "Our methodologies have yet to truly fail on a large scale, and we have already invested much in our capital ship program, so there is no reason why we should deviate from it. Additionally, or admirals and captains are already comfortable with these tactics, and will work like a well-oiled machine in future combat."
  SLW_modular_hulls:0 "Modular Hulls"
  SLW_modular_hulls_desc:0 "We simply do not have the number of ships that we require to properly defend our coasts. We can requisition some from civilians, but we must construct more and quickly. Although this will sacrifice some survivability, we will design universal armor plates, to reduce the time needed to weld class-specific pieces onto the hulls of our ships."
  SLW_improvements_to_weapons:0 "Improvements to a Deadly Weapon"
  SLW_improvements_to_weapons_desc:0 "There are numerous design changes that we can implement into our heaviest ships to improve their power projection. Of course, this relies on a balance of improvements for the entire platform. We can always fit bigger guns on our ships, it's simply a matter of figuring out how to keep them afloat."
  SLW_finalize_rulebooks:0 "Finalize Imperial Rulebooks"
  SLW_finalize_rulebooks_desc:0 "Our strategies have already been refined to near-elegance, but mistakes still happen to slip through the cracks. The officers and ships under our command require the most rigid and airtight rules of engagement to properly decimate our enemies, and we shall provide it to them."
  SLW_heavier_is_better:0 "Heavier is Better"
  SLW_heavier_is_better_desc:0 "We already have some of the strongest broadsides of any nation on the planet, why can't we put even bigger calibers on our battleships?"
  SLW_no_obstacle:0 "Water is No Obstacale"
  SLW_no_obstacle_desc:0 "If we are to one day retake our lost colonies across the sea, we will need a proper marine corps of the Solaris Militarium. These brave souls will have the strength of the Empress behind them as they storm beaches and raid coastlines of our enemies!"
  SLW_beachheads_to_spearheads:0 "Beachheads into Spearheads"
  SLW_beachheads_to_spearheads_desc:0 "How can we properly take the fight to those across the waters from us when we can barely keep our troops safe while crossing a river? Our old transports have become so outdated they would be swatted within seconds from the water. Larger, more defensible designs are needed, and needed now."
  SLW_everywhere_at_once:0 "Everywhere at Once"
  SLW_everywhere_at_once_desc:0 "If we supercharge the reactors of our capital ships with specially crafted crystal matrices, we can give our heaviest craft sudden bursts of speed that would put many lighter ships to shame. Our foes will never expect fifty-thousand tons of pure destruction barreling at them of up to thirty knots!"
  SLW_oceans_of_faithful:0 "Oceans of Faithful"
  SLW_oceans_of_faithful_desc:0 "We have repaired the Imperial Admirality and restored the navy to be the envy of Equus again. Our swarms of ships will protect our waters and bring the enemy to their knees. There shall be nowhere in the world that a loyal servant of the Empress will not be!"
  
  ###Air Tree###
  SLW_blame_solarbolts:0 "Blame the Solarbolts"
  SLW_blame_solarbolts_desc:0 "In truth, the Solarbolts have remained fairly loyal servants of the Empire, but we must find reasons for why our planes were outmatched in the civil war, and how heresy could have built up in the Empire. There are few options we have left. It's time for the "truth" to come out."
  SLW_empires_scapegoats:0 "Scapegoats of the Empire"
  SLW_empires_scapegoats_desc:0 "Unsurprisingly, the general populace were outraged that the Solarbolts and ponies associated with them would dare betray the Empire. There are already reports of multiple aces arrested and killed by vigilante mobs, and some pilots that have expressed distaste for the [GetNovaTitle] have already fled for fear of repurcussions."
  SLW_discredit_remains:0 "Discredit the Remains"
  SLW_discredit_remains_desc:0 "What is left of the Solarbolts have officially been disbanded, as punishment for their claimed heresy and betrayal. Unofficially, they've been reassigned to new wings to remain as the last few experienced pilots in the Empire. We have purged the airforce of most of its taint, but now it is a matter of rebuilding it grander than before."
  SLW_where_the_plane_failed:0 "Find Where the Plane Failed"
  SLW_where_the_plane_failed_desc:0 "It was not a matter of technology that left our planes outmatched and outgunned, it was more than that. While the Harmonists did manage to sneak a few advanced planes across the border, most were simply more skilled. To that end, we must completely redesign our workhorse fighter to counter skill with durability and firepower lest we lose the air war again."
  SLW_reliance_isnt_problematic:0 "Reliance isn't a Problem"
  SLW_reliance_isnt_problematic_desc:0 "Some of our strategists have complained that the [GetNovaTitle] desires for us to return to our same old plans for punishing mass heresy and fighting enemy emplacements. But the napalm bomb is a proven weapon, one that is pure in intention and measured in its destruction. We must learn to embrace and extend it to let it reach its full potential."
  SLW_remember_heritage:0 "Remember the Heritage"
  SLW_remember_heritage_desc:0 "The Solar Empire is descended from the Three Tribes, and that means we carry the martial tradition of the ancient pegasus state. Just like their greatest warriors, who fought and guarded their fellow ground-bound comrades, we must channel this pedigree to craft the greatest dive bombers the world has seen!"
  SLW_mutilate_air:0 "Mutilate from the Air"
  SLW_mutilate_air_desc:0 "The Imperial Airforce has only one mission: that is to wipe out heresy wherever it may be. To further that goal, we must place our efforts onto constructing the most powerful and unstoppable bombers the world has ever seen, so that we may smite our enemies wherever they lurk."
  SLW_enlarged_bays:0 "Enlarged Bomb Bays"
  SLW_enlarged_bays_desc:0 "Trips must be more destructive than ever, and the easiest way to accomplish that is to give our bombers munitions till they are almost bursting at the seams. Coordinating these heavier bombers will require refinement, but our pilots are more than up to the task for it."
  SLW_reach_anywhere:0 "Reach from Anywhere"
  SLW_reach_anywhere_desc:0 "Wherever the enemy may hide, they are not safe from our holy weapons. Our bombers carry bigger explosives than ever, to the point they can pierce the toughest armor or the thickest bunker. No matter where on Equus heretics may run, they can never be free fomr the reach of the Empress!"
  SLW_flexible_air:0 "A Flexible Air Tactic"
  SLW_flexible_air_desc:0 "The civil war severely hindered our air capabilities, and we have yet to truly recover from it. Nowhere is this more apparent than in our pitiful bomber corps. Ground support for our forces has been assessed as negligible, but our infrastructure destroying capacity is also reduced. This calls for some restructuring, and we can use our light bombers for the task."
  SLW_expanded_formations:0 "Expanded Flight Formations"
  SLW_expanded_formations_desc:0 "There is both strength and safety in numbers, and we shall dispatch more of our wings into larger and more defensible air formations. Since our screening crafts are at a premium, this will ensure that we can reach targets and obliterate them without risking the entire mission."
  SLW_square_pegs:0 "Square Pegs Fit Round Holes"
  SLW_square_pegs_desc:0 "While light bombers may not be the most suited to either strafing runs or crippling production, they can fill both roles adequately, and it is something they will have to accomplish. Jack of all trades might not be the most ideal, but if it's the difference between victory and defeat, we'll have to take it."
  SLW_spears_of_destruction:0 "Spears of Destruction"
  SLW_spears_of_destruction_desc:0 "With the newest advents in matrix technology, our dreams of jet-powered bombers striking from anywhere on the continent have finally become a potential reality. They shall be so reactive that we will be able to wipe out any threat before they can even lift a hoof to retaliate. Our bombers will be the javelins of death, guided by the Empress's light."
  SLW_balanced_winds:0 "Balanced Winds"
  SLW_balanced_winds_desc:0 "Just because we have spent much time on refining our bombers and preparing them for any war, that doesn't mean we can neglect our fighter corps. If it weren't for them, our bombers wouldn't reach the enemy with enough strength to burn them to the ground. We must keep them up-to-date as well, lest we cripple our airforce again without realizing it."
  SLW_lances_of_purity:0 "Lances of Purity"
  SLW_lances_of_purity_desc:0 "With holy fire, our strike bombers are able to protect our soldiers through any battlefield conditions. Advanced holds will carry the latest weaponry to scorch the heretics where they stand, which will inform the world to fear our wrath as it's carried by our faithful pilots."
  SLW_heavens_guardian:0 "Heaven's Guardian"
  SLW_heavens_guardian_desc:0 "After all this time, the memory of the Solarbolts has faded, and we can forge our new ideal pilot, one that will serve without any hesitation regarding their sacrifice to the Empress. These elite will protect the skies, no matter the altitude, giving our soldiers the respite they need to die for their goddess!"
  
  ###Manehattan Tree###
  SLW_toppled_grace:0 "Toppled from Grace"
  SLW_toppled_grace_desc:0 "One of the mistakes that was never rectified was Manehattan's condition. Since the rebellion, it has lain in partial ruin, with the government refusing to spend the time to look at repairs. This ends today, starting with a true inspection by the [GetNovaTitle] on how to rebuild better than ever."
  SLW_free_labor:0 "Uilize "Free" Labor"
  SLW_free_labor_desc:0 " Since the uprising, there has been a glut of harmonists who have filled our prisons awaiting their execution. But there is another potential fate for them. Instead of wasting resources, they could be put to work. After all, they caused this mess in the first place, and now it's time for them to fix it."
  SLW_construction_taxes:0 "Levy Construction Taxes"
  SLW_construction_taxes_desc:0 "How are we to accomplish the great renewing of the Empress's jewel if we do not have the money to do so? There are numerous businesses that have savings, let us use some of their funds to rebuild. It is the least they can do to help."
  SLW_repair_possible:0 "Repair What is Possible"
  SLW_repair_possible_desc:0 "While entire blocks have been destroyed, there are many more that have received only moderate damage. With a bit of elbow grease, a few hundred heretics' lives, and enough money, we can restore these to working condition far sooner than if we had to tear everything down."
  SLW_final_dregs:0 "Eradicate the Final Dregs"
  SLW_final_dregs_desc:0 "While it is believed that the heretics in Manethattan, let alone the Empire, have been defeated and wiped out, the [GetNovaTitle] can never be too sure. There are citizens that have expressed their distate for the state of the repairs; it is time they have an Inquisitionis visit."
  SLW_work_programs:0 "Work Programs for the Destitute"
  SLW_work_programs_desc:0 "The uprising left hundreds of thousands of ponies without proper work, and while some have managed to scrape by doing odd jobs, most have yet to find stable employment. Through some more money incentives, we can get many of these otherwise useless ponies to assist with construction. That way they won't starve and waste even more resources."
  SLW_economy_above:0 "Economy Above All Else"
  SLW_economy_above_desc:0 "With the city nearing complete restoration, we have the opportunity to correct some flaws in how it was run. The megalopolis is our greatest asset, yet it's lain neglected to simply be a military city. We must change that, and incentivize all industries to make their homes here through more subsidies and infrastructure programs."
  SLW_empires_foundry:0 "Foundry of the Empire"
  SLW_empires_foundry_desc:0 "Now that the repair of the city is almost finished, we can refine its role within the Empire to support our future expansion. There are untapped resources in the plains of Ordo Multi, and with added war forges, we can turn the city into a true foundry for the Empire that will feed our weapon needs to the end of time!"
  
  ###Starlight and Trixie Tree###
  SLW_loose_ends:0 "Some Loose Ends"
  SLW_loose_ends_desc:0 "The Empress was keeping some secrets from the Inquisitionis and the Speculatores. [GetNovaTitle] Nova Glow has discovered in the dungeons the two arch-heretics themselves: Starlight Glimmer and Trixie Lulamoon. Their fate rests in her hooves."
  SLW_daybreakers_regimen:0 "Reimplement Daybreaker's Regimen"
  SLW_daybreakers_regimen_desc:0 "According to the guards that had prevented the [GetNovaTitle] from entering the dungeon at first, Daybreaker was visiting the duo on an almost daily basis for reasons unknown. After some more investigating, the [GetNovaTitle] has determined they were being tortured and twisted to the Empress's will. There is no reason to stop that now that she's gone."
  SLW_lesson_in_fealty:0 "Lessons in Fealty"
  SLW_lesson_in_fealty_desc:0 "Starlight Glimmer has, according to information, always been independent and stubborn. Years have not done much to alter her personality. Despite weeks of torture at Daybreaker's hooves and months of isolation, she hasn't cracked. It is time that the [GetNovaTitle] tempers that with some humility."
  SLW_lifetime_performance:0 "Performance of a Lifetime"
  SLW_lifetime_performance_desc:0 "Compared to Starlight, Trixie is already showing signs of distress. She may still talk the talk, but does she walk the walk? The [GetNovaTitle] shall see, after testing just how much of that magician's skill has stuck around."
  SLW_friendship_is_weakness:0 "Friendship is Weakness"
  SLW_friendship_is_weakness_desc:0 "Starlight has yet to break. But that is acceptable, because her idiotic friend, Trixie, has. While the [GetNovaTitle] could attempt any number of further torture styles, there is always one constant: Harmonists have friends. And friends can be used against ponies."
  SLW_just_desserts:0 "Their Just Desserts"
  SLW_just_desserts_desc:0 "What does it matter that the Empress was attempting to coerce loyalty out of Starlight and Trixie? They are heretics, and on top of that, are the two most wanted ponies in the Empire. It would be far better to simply execute them and be done with it. Once they confess to their crimes, of course."
  SLW_lying_tongue:0 "The Lying Tongue"
  SLW_lying_tongue_desc:0 "A thespian always has a tongue of silver, which means that not a single word should be trusted that comes out of their mouth. That being said, they tend to break faster, and the [GetNovaTitle] has felt that she has grown slightly rusty since ascending. Perhaps it is time to cut the ego of Trixie down to size."
  SLW_wasted_potential:0 "Wasted Potential"
  SLW_wasted_potential_desc:0 "It is a shame that Starlight Glimmer did not maintain her loyalty to the Empire. Rumors abounded that she fought an alicorn to a stand-still, which is more than Sunset Shimmer could every lay claim to. Alas, she is like every other heretic, and we will obtain our list of crimes soon enough."
  SLW_extinction_of_heresy:0 "Extinction of Heresy"
  SLW_extinction_of_heresy_desc:0 "After many, arduous hours of interrogation and grilling, the Inquisitionis has its list of crimes that were committed by Starlight and Trixie: murder, theft, arson, blasphemy. These are but a short section of their sins. Sadly, the heretic pyre will be too kind to them, but it is their just punishment."
  
  ###Industry Tree###
  SLW_reparations_by_force:0 "Reparations by Force"
  SLW_reparations_by_force_desc:0 "Every pony, whether heretic or not, that fought on the side of the harmonists is guilty of the damage that was inflicted upon us when the civil war concluded. There is not an insignificant amount of wealth stored by them all, and it is high time we take what we are owed as the victors."
  SLW_levy_more_taxes:0 "Levy More Taxes"
  SLW_levy_more_taxes_desc:0 "War is not cheap; civil war even less so. It has been a difficult road to refill our coffers, given the amount of support to reconstruction that we must provide at this time. As much as it is painful to the faithful, there is only one course of action: new taxes must be implemented, no matter how unpopular it may be."
  SLW_further_culling:0 "Further Culling"
  SLW_further_culling_desc:0 "Not every harmonist took up direct arms against the Empire. Some stayed behind the lines and worked in the factories to churn out more weapons to keep killing our loyal troops. These have for now been ignored, but if we want to remove the risk of further disruption, they will have to go. Painfully."
  SLW_rebuild_manehattan:0 "Fund Manehattan Expansion"
  SLW_rebuild_manehattan_desc:0 "In a matter of a couple of years, Manehattan has weathered two devastating conflicts that ravaged it. While the initial repairs from the Manehattan Rebellion are over, we should dog-ear some money to further expand the city, as it can handle far more than what it is currently supplying to us in return."
  SLW_bless_loyalty:0 "Bless Fillydelphia's Loyalty"
  SLW_bless_loyalty_desc:0 "Of all the major cities, only Fillydelphia has remained steadfastly on the side of the Empress. Where Sanctum Solar fell, and Manehattan nearly erupted into war, Fillydelphia has stayed rock-steady through it all. That level of dedication deserves its reward, and Fillydelphia will receive it and then some."
  SLW_oppressing_unfaithful:0 "Oppressing the Unfaithful"
  SLW_oppressing_unfaithful_desc:0 "Of the harmonists that remain in the factories, we can use them for useful work. They have proven that they don't deserve to receive any protections from us, though, so if a few factory managers decide to extend their, and only their working hours - indefinitely - what does that concern us?"
  SLW_melt_scrap:0 "Melt Down the Scrap"
  SLW_melt_scrap_desc:0 "There is an inordinate amount of debris, scrap, and junk left over from the war in all the major cities. While they could all handle their own, Manehattan has the only dedicated forges that can be used to recycle various metals. Concentrating it there will improve overall efficiency, and provide work for the unemployed."
  SLW_no_homeless_exceptions:0 "No Exceptions for Homelessness"
  SLW_no_homeless_exceptions_desc:0 "Despite best efforts, the economy is still sluggish. There are a few more jobs, and some ponies are starting to make ends meet, but there are still numerous that are destitute. We can't let this continue. If ponies will not work, and they will not find shelter in the Adoratio temples, then they are of no use. Homelessness from henceforth will be illegal!"
  SLW_drain_marshes:0 "Industrialize the Plains"
  SLW_drain_marshes_desc:0 "The rurual communities outside of Fillydelphia, Manehattan, and other cities are ripe for expansion and development. Previous governments completely ignored them, but this time they will not escape the hooves of industry."
  SLW_expand_tartarus_industries:0 "Expand Tartarus Industries"
  SLW_expand_tartarus_industries_desc:0 "Tartarus Industries is relatively new, but they have multiple ingenious ideas for improving our economic outlook. Most involve smart use of the remaining heretics.\n\nThey are a company after the [GetNovaTitle]'s own heart."
  SLW_no_growth_heresy:0 "No Growth is Heresy"
  SLW_no_growth_heresy_desc:0 "The numbers are still not good enough! Businesses are still floundering around, claiming that there is nopony good enough to work at them. How can we keep recovering if our stores are faltering? Obviously they are not faithful enough. If they don't turn a profit soon, then the heretic's pyre may be waiting for them."
  SLW_inflate_to_pay:0 "Inflate to Pay Our Debts"
  SLW_inflate_to_pay_desc:0 "No country is an island, and even the Solar Empire had a few debts that it held from the Great War. While some of those creditors no longer exist, others have begun to demand payment. We simply don't have the economic power to pay for it all, but if we printed a bit more money, we could pay it off, in theory..."
  SLW_iron_tails_fun:0 "Let Iron Tail Have Her Fun"
  SLW_iron_tails_fun_desc:0 "Since we are in the process of rebuilding, and projects are being approved left and right, Archmage Iron Tail of Ordo Meurom has approached the [GetNovaTitle] about theories of hidden crystal deposits in the Foal Mountains. She would need some willing servants to test, but we have plenty of those for her to use."
  SLW_dont_meddle:0 "Don't Meddle Too Much"
  SLW_dont_meddle_desc:0 "We've already interfered enough with the economy to get it back on its hooves. Now that it's finally in a better place, we should hold back on being too dictatorial. That was part of why the Empire was so slow to recover under Daybreaker, and we shouldn't repeat the same mistake."
  SLW_formalize_control:0 "Formalize Control"
  SLW_formalize_control_desc:0 "With the economy mostly functional again, we have to make sure that it never crashes as hard as it did after the civil war. Every future proposal and construction project must be put through the Imperial Palace so that the proper administrator can approve it or not. If we stretch too thin, then we could collapse, and that would be disastrous if it's in the middle of a war."
  SLW_grant_subsidies:0 "Grant Subsidies Wherever Needed"
  SLW_grant_subsidies_desc:0 "Although we do not wish to step too much on the hooves of new companies, we need to keep them loyal somehow. Therefore, by incentivizing investment solely within Imperial lands, we will dedicate a large pool of funds for subsidizing new buildings, and ideally keep them from ever straying from us."
  SLW_require_quotas:0 "Require New Quotas"
  SLW_require_quotas_desc:0 "Every factory was required to follow certain outlines for how much of one good they could produce per year. This was unwieldy and usually inflexible, but it was not an unwise decision. Keeping a level of control through looser, yet heavily enforced quotas should allow more flexibility for the markets, but prevent total price collapse or inflation."
  SLW_reusable_consumerism:0 "Reusable Consumerism"
  SLW_reusable_consumerism_desc:0 "While the Empire may still have many resources that we can utilize, it would be more beneficial if we can slow the drain by designing a system that encourages ponies to return old and used products to be broken down back into constituent materials. Plus, if their new purchases happened to "break" earlier, that means more money in the economy back into our tax coffers."
  SLW_extract_everything:0 "Extract Everything Possible"
  SLW_extract_everything_desc:0 "As we continue to grow our economy, we must draw as much as we can from the earth while maintaining some level of sustainability. Some new techinques have been proposed of mixing magic with traditional mining technologies that could be of some use to us if we pursue them."
  SLW_prevent_disruption_risks:0 "Prevent Any Disruption Risk"
  SLW_prevent_disruption_risks_desc:0 "Many nations grow more vulnerable to pipeline problems as they expand their industries, as they planned for peacetime rather than war. Desgining our sprawl in advance by introducing redundancies for supplies and disguising some of our industry will come into much use later once we focus on Equus proper."
  SLW_excavate_depths:0 "Excavate the Depths"
  SLW_excavate_depths_desc:0 "Further surveys of the various Ordos in the Empire have produced more locations that could be cleared for new mining projects. We must still, at this point, rely on our own resources above all else, so this will remain on our docket for quite some time. There may be new sites that we uncover in the rump states, as well."
  SLW_reactive_manufacturing_lines:0 "Reactive Manufacturing Lines"
  SLW_reactive_manufacturing_lines_desc:0 "By removing most of our influence from how businesses and factories operate, we have allowed the free market to return, at least partly. While we have a say, it is not at the cost of the vaunted flexibility of private enterprise, and they are expected to react to any needs we have in coming conflicts."
  SLW_minimal_involvement:0 "Keep Involvement Minimal"
  SLW_minimal_involvement_desc:0 "Keeping the stranglehold that the Empire has had on the education topics of the younger generations has had admittedly disappointing results. While the ponies are loyal - mostly - they are generally poorly equipped for progressing the level of advancement forward. As such, we've dropped behind even Cloudsdale in our knowledge! This has to change immediately."
  SLW_ban_heretical_education:0 "Ban All Potentially Heretical Education"
  SLW_ban_heretical_education_desc:0 "There were far too many students that deserted to the Harmonist cause in the civil war. Quite obviously, their education was sorely lacking in proper reverence to the Empress and now the [GetNovaTitle]. Focusing further on the improtance of ponykind and their duty to the Empire must be instilled at once."
  SLW_allow_some_innovation:0 "Allow Some Innovation"
  SLW_allow_some_innovation_desc:0 "While some ideas proposed for improving our nation are unequivocally heretical, there are many more that could have some merit. If they were tweaked a bit and made a bit more palatable to the laypony, there could be some benefits for us all."
  SLW_hall_icons:0 "Icons through the Halls"
  SLW_hall_icons_desc:0 "It is a travesty that the general schools in the various regions of the Empire do not have enough iconography of Daybreaker, her exploits, and her chosen ponies. We must rectify this soon. New schedules around reverance and prayer to the God-Empress will be required, lest anypony believe they deserve to not follow her all their lives."
  SLW_matrix_sight:0 "Matrix-enhanced Sight"
  SLW_matrix_sight_desc:0 "Due to the laxer rules around experimentation, we have received a boon already! A certain Nightfly in Manehattan's Institute of Matrix-technology has developed a novel new way to insert lenses made from matrices that could improve both night vision and long-distance details. These could prove useful to our scouts in future conflict."
  SLW_holier_than_napalm:0 "Holier than Napalm"
  SLW_holier_than_napalm_desc:0 "Let it not be said that religion stifles ingenuity. We have found old research notes from the heretic, Fluttershy, buried within some old offices in Fillydelphia's university. The students there have already taken these papers to heart, proclaiming that what they have discovered, if finalized, could purge entire cities in one blast fromn their righteous flames. Holy Napalm might finally be beaten."
  SLW_faithful_scientists:0 "Faithful Scientists"
  SLW_faithful_scientists_desc:0 "While there are still many skeptical of our results, it cannot be argued that the ponies ocming out of our universities now are far better off to combat Bales or another rogue state's scientific resources than before. Plus, if they stray, they know the consequences."
  SLW_religious_teachers:0 "Religious Teachers for All"
  SLW_religious_teachers_desc:0 "Not enough of those who are entrusted to lead our young into the future have proper Adoratio instruction and knowledge to keep the next generation from straying. To that effect, from now on, a priestess will accompany any non-clergy instructor to the classroom, to correct any misinformation, and punish heresy if need be."
  SLW_theocratic_industry:0 "Theocratic Industry"
  SLW_theocratic_industry_desc:0 "At this point, we can finally start to urge our workers and designers around the idea of serving the Empress even in mundane things like working an assembly line. Since so many were lost in the civil war, replacing them with even more loyal layponies should be straightfoward, and we could see benefitis almost immediately."
  SLW_all_through_IBEA:0 "All Must Go Through IBEA"
  SLW_all_through_IBEA_desc:0 "IBEA has been in various stages of completion for many years, but it is time to make it a bit more concrete than before. Now any future development and advancement in industry must get their approval first, lest any heresy slip by undetected. Additionally, they will zone denser industrial sections, so we can cram more production in small areas."
  SLW_loosen_regulations:0 "Loosen Regulations"
  SLW_loosen_regulations_desc:0 "Not everything needs to be monitored constantly. For instance, some of the various zoning laws that govern how much industry can be in an area has little impact on the orthodoxy of a business. What need do we have to keep it around, when we can get projects done quicker if it just didn't exist?"
  SLW_projects_sake:0 "Projects for Projects' Sake"
  SLW_projects_sake_desc:0 "To keep the relevance of IBEA consistent, and to distract workers from potentially forming unions or creating new heretic cells, we will provide constant, unending construction tasks that will keep them under wraps. Besides, there is always a ditch somewhere that needs to be filled, or be dug."
  SLW_let_empress_decide:0 "Let the Empress Decide"
  SLW_let_empress_decide_desc:0 "Even if she is no longer with us, the Empress is the beating heart of the Empire, and we should always trust in her divine judgement. Only the [GetNovaTitle] is able to discern her intentions, and we trust that she will guide us as we forge our future with new production and quotas."
  SLW_faithful_conglomerations:0 "Conglomerations of the Faithful"
  SLW_faithful_conglomerations_desc:0 "Despite the long days, some workers are still speaking of forming unions. We should not stop them, but we should also not allow them to do as they please. If we plant a few priestesses here and there as the organizers of these "holy unions," we can control them that much easier into doing what we wish, so long as they believe it benefits them."
  SLW_continual_industrial_planning:0 "Continual Industrial Planning"
  SLW_continual_industrial_planning_desc:0 "An economy is like a massive ship that sees an iceberg miles away. We can control what exactly we can do, but it takes time and effort to reorganize things from the top level down. To that end, we must have plans within plans and contingencies for contingencies if we wish to keep our growth that we've achieved. It may be slow, but it will always pack a punch."
  SLW_prioritize_markets:0 "Prioritize Internal Markets"
  SLW_prioritize_markets_desc:0 "While we do need some assistance from outside sources, we shouldn't necessarily reciprocate. Our citizens are far more important than anypony in Zebrica or a griffon in Griffonia, so we should always provide for ourselves from our resources before we give to others. This may burn a few bridges in the process, however."
  SLW_level_slums:0 "Level the Slums"
  SLW_level_slums_desc:0 "As it's been a low priority, we finally have the economic bandwidth to clear out the riff-raff from the major megalopolises in the Empire. They have been squatting on perfectly good crown land and holding up repair jobs in the hive cities for too long, and it is time for them to go whether they are able to survive or not."
  SLW_labor_to_salvation:0 "Labor Leads to Salvation"
  SLW_labor_to_salvation_desc:0 "Ingraining the concept of perpetual work was hard, but we have accomplished enough that our ponies believe that they serve the Empress through death, life, and every moment in between. Toiling long hours over the factory lines is just one way that they can achieve salvation, for if they don't, they will burn forever in Tartarus."

  SLW_rampant_disunity_desc:0 "The tensions that have lain dormant in Imperial society for decades have finally been laid bare. Although we now reign from [SLW.capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] across an empire on paper, the Harmonist threat has not been defeated yet. It is still unsafe to be a member of the faithful."
  SLW_rampant_disunity_2:0 "Rampant Disunity"
  SLW_rampant_disunity_2_desc:0 "With arrests and the first heretic burnings, the tension has begun to ease slightly in the Empire, but most ponies still distrust each other. Hersy could still be hiding around any corner."

  SLW_rampant_disunity_3_desc:0 "As the Inquisitionis continues to clean up the remains of the civil war and the heresy it stirred, society is beginning to return to normal again.

  SLW_militarium_impunity_desc:0 "While most of the heretics have been purged from the Militarium, Blueblood now refuses to acknowledge [GetNovaTitle] Nova Glow as the rightful successor of the God-Empress. Many troops are in open insubordination, and at the moment, there is little we can do."
  SLW_militarium_impunity_2:0 "Militarium Impunity"
  SLW_militarium_impunity_2_desc:0 "Some of the most vocal of the protesting officers have been arrested and placed on trial for heresy and treason; this has calmed things down a bit, but it is still a chore attempting to communicate any orders other than defending the borders to our troops."
  SLW_militarium_impunity_3:0 "Militarium Impunity"
  SLW_militarium_impunity_3_desc:0 "Continued cleansing of the upper and lower ranks have begun to silence many of the naysayers that decry [GetNovaTitle] Nova Glow's efforts as our new leader. Whispers of desertion or mutiny are almost unheard of now, although they still remain a threat."
  SLW_militarium_impunity_4:0 "Militarium Impunity"
  SLW_militarium_impunity_4_desc:0 "Only a few of the most stubborn, old, and angry of our officers remain against the [GetNovaTitle]. Once they are convinced or retired, the Militarium will in effect be a whole unit again, and we can finally stop with this nonsense."
  SLW_naval_deserters:0 "Naval Deserters"
  SLW_naval_deserters_desc:0 "Like the Militarium, the Imperial Navy refuses to see the [GetNovaTitle] as the heir to the Empire and most of our fleet has remained stationed outside of harbor, preying on the few civilian ships going by for supplies."
  SLW_naval_deserters_2:0 "Naval Deserters"
  SLW_naval_deserters_2_desc:0 "Replacing most of the remaining admirality with ponies more inclined to agree with the [GetNovaTitle] will gives us at least some legitimacy for ordering the rogue ships back into port. A few have returned, but most remain staunchy independent."

  SLW_naval_deserters_3_desc:0 "With all the current loyal sailors back, there only remains the option of threatening the remaining AWOL ships to ground themselves and be prepared for arrest. This has left some disarray in the navy, but it will be sorted out soon enough."
  SLW_airforce_heresy:0 "Airforce Heresy"
  SLW_airforce_heresy_desc:0 "Of all the branches of the military, the Imperial Airforce had the greatest number of desertions to Celestia's side. As free-spirited ponies to begin with, they are still as a whole refusing to follow our directives. It is probable heresy is still rife within it."
  SLW_airforce_heresy_2:0 "Airforce Heresy"
  SLW_airforce_heresy_2_desc:0 "The initial blaming of the Solarbolts for much of the problems with the Imperial Airforce has given us casus beli to purge the otherwise popular branch of the military with relative ease. This has massively reduced the number of leaders for our squadrons, since nopony wants to stand out in these trying times."
  SLW_airforce_heresy_3:0 "Airforce Heresy"
  SLW_airforce_heresy_3_desc:0 "Troublesome pilots are disappearing all the time as the laypony takes matters into their own hooves, as they believe the Airfoce is being "corrupted" by the heretics in the Solarbolts.

  SLW_deadened_economy_desc:0 "Because of the civil war, much of our civilian infrastructure lies in ruins.

  SLW_deadened_economy_2:0 "Deadened Economy"
  SLW_deadened_economy_2_desc:0 "The first heartbeats of our economy have begun to occur, as some factories have re-opened and provided desperate goods for our citizens. The initial tax has started to help repay war debts, and it should be snowball effect from here."
  SLW_deadened_economy_3:0 "Deadened Economy"
  SLW_deadened_economy_3_desc:0 "Through forced taxes and excruciating hours, we have managed to provide some semblance of a functioning economy to our ponies. Most are no longer on the brink of starvation, but they aren't quite living in splendor, either."

  SLW_modular_designs_desc:0 "As a compromise on our new fleets, we need to have quickly swappable parts in case they break down or require rapid retrofitting with new weaponry. Sailors can complain about leaks all they want so long as the ships float."
  SLW_biggest_stick:0 "Bigger, Badder Sticks"
  SLW_biggest_stick_desc:0 "In the race for new ships, it is sometimes forgotten that heavier payloads can be the difference between survival and defeat. Besides, battleships should always be able to vaporize entire city blocks if necessary."

As she is descended from one of the many noble houses of Sanctum Solar, she frequently meddles in things beyond her purview. With her hooves in so many pies, she tends to keep a charisma about her that is able to distract from her true intentions. That doesn't really lend well to a position as general, however, which hampers her units' offensive capabilities in battle."

A sub-branch of the Solaris Militarium, the Praetorian Guard acts completely autonomously from the rest of the Solar Empire's military and government, fully dedicated to their sole duty of protecting the Empress from harm.

  SLW_nova_empress:0 "§YBorn§!: August 25th, 1018 ALB\n\nWhile not the most talented of mages of the Solaris Inquisitionis, Nova Glow replaces it with general competency and a ruthless desire to see Daybreaker honored. An orphan from the Southeast's war of independence, she was raised in a household that resisted the order that Daybreaker had set up. Yet this only drove her resolve of anti-heresy further, which in turn fueled eventual punishment from her adoptive family.\n\nIn 1029, she was able to finally alert the Inquisitionis to her family and turned them in herself, as she brought Ordo Multi inquisitors to her abode. Only a single member escaped, and she was soon seen as a potential devotee of the cult, which led to placement in one of the religious schools in Manehattan.\n\nAfter showing enough promise to be sent to Daybreaker's school for training mages and archmages, she reached her limit, barely passing and receiving a stationing back in Ordo Multi. Under its newest archmage, Nebula Flare, she learned some more abilities while practicing physical warfare with her fellow mage, Aurora Shinespark.\n\nAs a fairly reserved pony, she grew close with Nebula before her mentor fled as an exposed heretic, which pushed Nova further into her drive to eliminate it. Aurora was made archmage in Nebula's stead, leaving Nova with the same rank she held before, something that niggled her for years.\n\nIn the civil war with Equestria, Nova proved herself capable as a general, and unwholly loyal to Daybreaker. Now as the Prefectess of the Solar Empire, she has been tasked with filling the shoes of her God-Empress in guiding the Empire to new heights. Yet coming on the heels of an omnipotent, omniscient goddess is a massive task, and it remains to be seen if she can handle the pressure.\n\nIt was an inevitability that a pony pushed so greatly would eventually break. Proclaiming herself the second coming of Daybreaker, Nova has usurped the title of Empress and become its new Empress-Prefectess. Executions have already been lined up for the last of those who question her sanity, and she has already spoken of how she will repair the Empire. It is only a matter of time until the mad Empress spirals the world into eternal darkness.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
