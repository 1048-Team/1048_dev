  ###Leader Descriptions###
  POLITICS_1048_MIDWINTER_HALO_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: February 11th, 985 ALB\n\n§YBiography§!: For most of her life, Midwinter Halo has served Daybreaker faithfully as one of the first-generation inquisitors that helped to establish the Solar Empire. As a foal, she lived in one of the estates near Canterlot to one of the minor noble families who served in Celestia's day court. She would make numerous trips to Canterlot to experience the high life in Canterlot Castle, and she met Celestia numerous times before attending school.\n\nWhen the Great War broke out in 1011, she volunteered to serve as one of the various military officers that Equestria desperately needed. By this point, she had already become known for her harsh demeanor against other nobles, especially those of the Corona family, and she applied much of her same aggressive tactics to warfare.\n\nIn the chaos that ensued after Daybreaker's ascension, she ultimately stayed loyal to the throne and followed to the pits of the worst fighting that anypony could envision. After displaying some of her talent for fire magic, Daybreaker promoted her laterally, from major to inquisitor, one of the first mages of the Solar Empire to root out heresy and keep the country safe from internal threats.\n\nAs years passed, she slowly worked her way to archmage status after she led a small band of inquisitors to squash a growing rebel cell near the border with the Principality of Central Equestria. Her skill from her years as a noble in court also gave her decent administrative ability, which moved her in her later years to general oversight of Inquisitionis movements.\n\nWith Daybreaker gone, the throne of the Empire now lays empty, and Midwinter has taken it upon herself to lead in her stead. Pragmatic and ruthless, she has the backing of most of the Solar Cult for the time being, she has already expressed her disinterest in complete control. She is the pony the Empire needs, but not the one it deserves.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
  POLITICS_1048_NOVA_GLOW_SLW_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: August 25th, 1018 ALB\n\nWhile not the most talented of mages of the Solaris Inquisitionis, Nova Glow replaces it with general competency and a ruthless desire to see Daybreaker honored. An orphan from the Southeast's war of independence, she was raised in a household that resisted the order that Daybreaker had set up. Yet this only drove her resolve of anti-heresy further, which in turn fueled eventual punishment from her adoptive family.\n\nIn 1029, she was able to finally alert the Inquisitionis to her family and turned them in herself, as she brought Ordo Multi inquisitors to her abode. Only a single member escaped, and she was soon seen as a potential devotee of the cult, which led to placement in one of the religious schools in Manehattan.\n\nAfter showing enough promise to be sent to Daybreaker's school for training mages and archmages, she reached her limit, barely passing and receiving a stationing back in Ordo Multi. Under its newest archmage, Nebula Flare, she learned some more abilities while practicing physical warfare with her fellow mage, Aurora Shinespark.\n\nAs a fairly reserved pony, she grew close with Nebula before her mentor fled as an exposed heretic, which pushed Nova further into her drive to eliminate it. Aurora was made archmage in Nebula's stead, leaving Nova with the same rank she held before, something that niggled her for years.\n\nIn the civil war with Equestria, Nova proved herself capable as a general, and unwholly loyal to Daybreaker. Now as the Prefectess of the Solar Empire, she has been tasked with filling the shoes of her God-Empress in guiding the Empire to new heights. Yet coming on the heels of an omnipotent, omniscient goddess is a massive task, and it remains to be seen if she can handle the pressure.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

  ###Midwinter Civil War Tree###
  SLW_light_unperceived:0 "Light Unperceived"
  SLW_light_unperceived_desc:0 "It is our own fault. We failed to see the signs of heresy building throughout the Empire. Now, with our Empress gone, what hope do we have left? A last, desperate fight for Order will be how we treat our enemies and we must find somepony to fill those shoes quickly."
  SLW_keeping_the_crown_jewel:0 "Keeping the Crown Jewel"
  SLW_keeping_the_crown_jewel_desc:0 "Manehattan has been one of the centers of the Empire, and now that we have lost Sanctum Solar to rebellion, it is our de facto capital. Focusing further on it will leave it in a better position if we win this war and will also aid us in the coming battles."
  SLW_force_them_to_work:0 "Force Them to Work"
  SLW_force_them_to_work_desc:0 "Why should ponies worry about shift times, fair labor, or breaks when there is a war for survival going on? Anypony seen abandoning their jobs will be treated like a coward running from battle: with a bullet to the back of their head."
  SLW_service_absolves_heresy:0 "Service Absolves Heresy"
  SLW_service_absolves_heresy_desc:0 "Promising convicts, vagabonds, and heretics that they will be freed upon the conclusion of this war if they fight for us will allow us to press further bodies into service. Of course, we're lying. Nopony earns forgiveness after the crimes they committed. Nopony."
  SLW_emergency_restructuring:0 "Emergency Restructuring"
  SLW_emergency_restructuring_desc:0 "When Daybreaker was... killed, the heretics that took power arrested almost all of the various heads of government were arrested or turned sides. [SLW.GetLeader] is doing her best, but she is one mare and requires assistance. Thankfully there are many faithful in Manehattan who can fill the roles needed."
  SLW_conscript_the_adoratio_militias:0 "Conscript the Inquisitionis Militias"
  SLW_conscript_the_adoratio_militias_desc:0 "While the Militarium is the primary military defense of the Empire, the Inquisitionis and even the Adoratio kept reserves of paramilitary forces. Now it is time to call upon them, whether they wish to go to the front lines or not."
  SLW_redeemed_by_the_praetorians:0 "Saved by the Praetorians"
  SLW_redeemed_by_the_praetorians_desc:0 "By a stroke of Daybreaker's holy mane, a chunk of the Praetorian guard survived and escaped to the Empire. Now their commander, Thundering Hoofbeat has stepped in to provide his expertise. These veterans fighting by our sides will cause the heretics to tremble and give our soldiers a much-needed boon to their morale."
  SLW_an_unexpected_surprise:0 "An Unexpected Arrival"
  SLW_an_unexpected_surprise_desc:0 "Nopony made it out of Sanctum Solar. Not one. However, somepony dressed as an archmage is demanding to see [SLW.GetLeader]. She claims she needs to see somepony from Sanctum Solar to calm down. And about three glasses of wine."
  SLW_imperial_sanctity:0 "Imperial_sanctity"
  SLW_imperial_sanctity_desc:0 "These last few months have proven that we are not a pushover to the heretics. Every inch of this country is holy ground, and we will not see it defiled by their presence. Not one step back further will be tolerated. Not one!"
  SLW_ensure_the_loyalty_of_the_militarium:0 "Ensure Militarium Loyalty"
  SLW_ensure_the_loyalty_of_the_militarium_desc:0 "Heresy was and probably still is rampant throughout the Militarium. It's time we remind them that they are not above a culling every now and then."
  SLW_end_the_false_empress:0 "Death to the False Goddess!"
  SLW_end_the_false_empress_desc:0 "Celestia is not our goddess! She never was. She was weak, ineffective, and the one who spawned much evil into this world. All those who follow her are nothing but insects which we must eradicate from our homeland. Nothing less will please the memory of Daybreaker. Sol Invicta!"
  
  ###Opening Nova Tree###
  SLW_glowing_corpse:0 "Glowing Corpse"
  SLW_glowing_corpse_desc:0 "The Imperium Civil Was has ended. We have won. But what at what cost?"
  SLW_ease_minds:0 "Ease Their Minds"
  SLW_ease_minds_desc:0 "Although the immediate threat of the civil war has ended, many faithful are rightfully terrified of the coming months. Our Empress is dead, and the false goddess Celestia has taken her place to spout mockeries and heresies to anypony who comes near her. The Prefectess must calm everypony quickly, lest more violence breaks out and leaves us defenseless."
  SLW_tenuous_control:0 "Tenuous Control"
  SLW_tenuous_control_desc:0 "Many ponies within the Militarium willfully sided with the false goddess to fight against us in the name of "freedom" and "harmony." What is left of it has already expressed their distaste that they were not consulted with choosing a successor to Daybreaker. As their new head, it is up to the Prefectess to keep them in line, especially as more dissent appears to be growing."
  SLW_teetering_edge:0 "Teetering on the Edge"
  SLW_teetering_edge_desc:0 "To say that the civil war was decimating on our economy would be an understatement. Many factories were destroyed and infrastructure was shredded thanks to Harmonist activity. And that was before the frontlines began to clash. Our economists have assessed the damage, and not one is around to present it after their worried, hasty exit out of a tenth story window after they finished."
  SLW_status_quo:0 "Return to the Status Quo"
  SLW_status_quo_desc:0 "Sanctum Solar has been the capital of the Empire since its inception, and the ancestral head of ponykind since Equestria was formed. Now that the war is over, many nobles that survived have already returned to the city, and are begging for us to return proper governance there. There is little reason to disappoint them."
  SLW_compromise_location:0 "Compromise on a Central Location"
  SLW_compromise_location_desc:0 "Both Sanctum Solar and Manehattan have been vying for their location to be chosen for the new Imperial capital, and it would lead to unfortunate unrest if one was chosen over the other. However, there is a third option. Fillydelphia remained loyal and is roughly halfway between Sanctum Solar and Manehattan, so there is no reason why it cannot be chosen instead."
  SLW_faithful_city:0 "Reward the Faithful City"
  SLW_faithful_city_desc:0 "Manehattan was our de facto capital while we fought in this vicious war. It has remained fairly undamaged from the fighting, and is the best location to permanently establish our new government. While many of the nobles can complain and whine about it, a majority of the city's populace supports this idea, and we should bless them for staying loyal to the Empress."
  SLW_execute_ringleaders:0 "Execute the Ringleaders"
  SLW_execute_ringleaders_desc:0 "When Celestia slew Daybreaker, it was a dog whistle for every other Harmonist who resided within the Empire to come out of the woodwork and be a thorn in our side. However, this is a double-edged sword, as we have captured a majority of the rebels that have plagued us for years. We have a special place for them in the heretic pyre."
  SLW_everypony_mourn:0 "Everypony Must Mourn"
  SLW_everypony_mourn_desc:0 "In the last few months there has not been proper time to hold ceremony for Daybreaker, which has caused growing despair and anger in the faithful. A midday vigil is being planned in Manehattan, Fillydelphia, and Sanctum Solar, along with numerous other towns and villages. Everypony must mourn our Empress, for her light has gone out in the world. There isn't even a body to inter."
  SLW_everypony_to_daybreaker:0 "Point Them All to Daybreaker"
  SLW_everypony_to_daybreaker_desc:0 "The Prefectess has been incredibly stressed this past while, and she has finally turned to the Adoratio and Inquisitionis for help. Together, they have started to draft new ideas for government, the first of which leaving all final matters up to prayer and divination from the Empress. She will solve all the problems, even now, beyond the grave."
  SLW_continue_fight:0 "Continue the Fight"
  SLW_continue_fight_desc:0 "Despite the pressure of the last few months, Prefectess Nova Glow has weathered it well. In fact, she has taken to it admirably, with a regal air to her. Even with the damage the nation is still recovering from, she has laid out her intentions to push us to victory, one dead heretic at a time."
  
  ###Shared Political Tree###
  SLW_witch_hunts:0 "Encourage Further Witch Hunts"
  SLW_witch_hunts_desc:0 "Ponies are angry, that much is clear. The civil war ripped this nation apart and exposed old wounds that had festered for far too long. For the last several weeks many of the faithful have taken it upon themselves to enact judgement of those who are suspected Harmonists. So it's been prevented from getting out of hoof, by why should we stop them doing our work for us?"
  SLW_jumpstart_economy:0 "Jumpstart with some Heat"
  SLW_jumpstart_economy_desc:0 "There is no reason why production levels are so low, except for one thing: slothfulness. In the chaos, many ponies have banded together to demand improved "workers rights" and the like. We will give them an ultimatum: return to work, or be shot. It would be one less pony to feed."
  SLW_scrutinize_cult:0 "Scrutinize the Cult"
  SLW_scrutinize_cult_desc:0 "There have been dissenting voices within the Adoratio and Inquisitionis regarding the appointment of the Prefectess. On top of that, the only reason that heresy was allowed to get out of hoof so easily must have been because of traitors in its midst. There msut be a cleansing at once, lest the Prefectess suffers the same fate as Daybreaker."
  SLW_fund_speculatores:0 "Further Fund the Speculatores"
  SLW_fund_speculatores_desc:0 "Obviously one of the shortcomings in the Empire was that the Solaris Speculatores, our elite intelligence agency, was not provided enough money to properly observe every detail prior. The new head, Subdacta Lux, has contacted the Prefectess regarding such matters, with the promises of rich rewards."
  SLW_expand_praetorians:0 "Expand the Praetorian Guard"
  SLW_expand_praetorians_desc:0 "Only the Praetorian Guard had the loyalty and wherewithal to stay pure to the Empress. For that they shall be rewarded. While they were once part of the Militarium, they are their own separate branch, answerable only to the Prefectess and their commander, Thundering Hoofbeat. Further support will swell their numbers, until they can protect the Prefectess no matter where she goes."
  SLW_observe_everypony:0 "Observe Everypony"
  SLW_observe_everypony_desc:0 "The Speculatores have already put the additional financing to good use, and greatly enlarged our network of informants, contacts, and remote surveillance spell matrices. In some way, shape, or form, everypony in the Empire is now being watched. Surely none of them have anything to hide, do they?"
  SLW_execute_false_empress:0 "Execute the False Goddess"
  SLW_execute_false_empress_desc:0 "It was with exceeding travail that we were able to capture the one who perpetrated all this. Princess Celestia has been rotting in our cells for months now, but we finally have the capacity to enforce her sentence. For the murder of the God-Empress, there is only one verdict: death."
  
  ###Nova Empress Tree###
  SLW_declare_heretics:0 "Declare All Opposed as Heretics"
  SLW_declare_heretics_desc:0 "Many of the layponies have decried Nova's desire to increase military preparedness before recovering entirely from the civil war. They are clearly against the will of Daybreaker, and must be silenced. A few heresy charges will end opposition in short order."
  SLW_inquisitionis_kneel:0 "Make the Inquisitionis Kneel"
  SLW_inquisitionis_kneel_desc:0 "Not even the Inquisitionis is free from dissent. Nova's decrees have stirred up some within the ranks to question whether she is still fit to lead as Prefectess. Pondering the ability of the Empress's chosen is pure heresy. These inquisitors must be broken, or they will be executed."
  SLW_dissolve_government:0 "Dissolve the Imperial Cabinet"
  SLW_dissolve_government_desc:0 "What did the cabinet ever do for us? They delayed and stalled, adding more red tape than was needed to stymie any attempts at passing laws without the Empress's direct power. They have no use for us now, as ultimate power lies in the Prefectess, who always knows what is best."
  SLW_purify_adoratio:0 "Purify the Militias"
  SLW_purify_adoratio_desc:0 "The Adoratio helps maintain and organize various militia groups of faithful ponies across the Empire. But they have been tainted, as heretics and harmonists have slipped into the ranks to corrupt it from within. We must rip the chaff out, before we have to destroy the entire Ordo to keep it pure."
  SLW_cleanse_inquisitors:0 "Cleanse Rebellious Inquisitors"
  SLW_cleanse_inquisitors_desc:0 "Despite every chance of receiving mercy, there are some inquisitors who believe that Nova is attempting to usurp Daybreaker's place as the goddess of all ponies. That is absurd! She only seeks to keep the Empire together, through any means. These voices must be silenced. Permanently."
  SLW_above_all:0 "One Head Above All"
  SLW_above_all_desc:0 "The weakness of the Adoratio and Inquisitionis was its separation. Sunset led the Adoratio, while Quasar Pulse was an entirely autonomous underling. In correcting the errors of the past, Nova Glow will place this heavy burden on herself. It is her Daybreaker-given right, after all."
  SLW_puppet_diet:0 "Install a Puppet Diet"
  SLW_puppet_diet_desc:0 "The Prefectess may be absolute, but establishing a small council that she can "converse" with will provide a stronger backing for her decrees. This will be made of her most loyal supporters. If somepony questions her, they will be shot, until an agreement is ratified. It sounds like a fair deal."
  SLW_some_live:0 "Allow Some to Live"
  SLW_some_live_desc:0 "There would be too much wasted talent to kill everypony who has doubts about the legitimacy of the Prefectess's mission. Nova has promised mercy to some, asking any who want restitution to meet with her so she can intercede on their behalf to the Empress that they may be returned to the fold."
  SLW_swear_new_oaths:0 "Swear New Oaths"
  SLW_swear_new_oaths_desc:0 ""For her mercy is great, her patience everlasting.\nWe are her sword and shield, we do not think of our own safety.\nOur salvation is bought with our blood, spilt for the Prefectess's will.\nPraise to her who speaks on our behalf to the God-Empress.\nSol Invicta, glory to Daybreaker.""
  SLW_bless_praetorians:0 "Bless the Praetorian Guard"
  SLW_bless_praetorians_desc:0 "Our loyal servants in the Praetorian Guard stood with us when nopony else would. That strength should be rewarded. The Prefectess promises that the Empress will give them great victory in the future, as she and they tie their futures together for the good of the Empire."
  SLW_silence_deniers:0 "Silence the Last Deniers"
  SLW_silence_deniers_desc:0 "It is a shame that Sunset and some of the other most talented inquisitors have steadfastly refused to cooperate with the Prefectess. It is no matter, they will be replaced eventually. We only wish that she could have seen the light of day."
  SLW_correct_misinformation:0 "Correct Misinformation"
  SLW_correct_misinformation_desc:0 "There is a remarkable amount of fake news being instructed in the schools. Daybreaker did not perish, she is still with us the whole time! This must be rectified immediately!"
  SLW_power_of_sun:0 "Show the Power of the Sun"
  SLW_power_of_sun_desc:0 "Ponies believed that the Forever Sun Celebration would never be seen again, but they were wrong. As we speak, the event planning is underway. It is promised that it will be the grandest, most extravegant yet, to show all that they mustn't fear for the future."
  SLW_new_empress:0 "The New Empress"
  SLW_new_empress_desc:0 "§RFor I am her and she is me. I am her and she is me. I AM HER AND SHE IS ME!§!"
  
  ###Nova Theocracy Tree###
  SLW_religious_exemption:0 "Religious Exemptions"
  SLW_religious_exemption_desc:0 "Many ponies have shown their true colors after the civil war, and we must find ways to differentiate between a potential heretic and a true follower of Daybreaker. To that end, new laws will be put in place that will be hheavily enforced. Anypony who doesn't swear immediate faith in Daybreaker will be cut off from society, where they can more easily be inspected for heresy."
  SLW_another_crusade:0 "Another Grand Crusade"
  SLW_another_crusade_desc:0 "Quasar Pulse has been nearly begging for the chance to lead inquisitors from her own private Ordo, Ordo Fidelum, on a hunt for anypony in Ordo Solis suspected of heresy. These inquisitors have been known to grow far too zealous and take justice into their own hooves in the field. They will be perfect to exact vengeance."
  SLW_merge_cults:0 "Merge the Two Cults"
  SLW_merge_cults_desc:0 "For decades the Solaris Adoratio and Inquisitionis have been in a strange relationship. Technically, they are one, but the former is led by the High Mage - who is in charge of both - and the latter is led de facto by the Lady Inquisitor. As these leaders have clashed in the past, it is time to do away with these barriers. Lady Inquisitor Quasar Pulse is just the pony for the job."
  SLW_replace_nobles:0 "Faithful Nobles"
  SLW_replace_nobles_desc:0 "The oldest of the aristocracy are those who have lived before and through the Great War. When Daybreaker awakened, she kept them as political pawns to give the appearance that she consulted with others before her laws were enacted. These nobles held little love for her, and it is time we repay them in kind by replacing them. With loyal puppets."
  SLW_oversee_command:0 "Oversee the High Command"
  SLW_oversee_command_desc:0 "Most generals are loyal. Most. There were, however, a number of talented ponies that secretly remained followers of Celestia, and we must ensure that future generations of generals do not fall prey to Harmony's lies."
  SLW_sanctified_unicorns:0 "Sanctified for the Empress"
  SLW_sanctified_unicorns_desc:0 "Blessed are the unicorns of the Empire, for they are the most favored of all creation. We must induct more of them into the Adoratio and Inquisitionis, so that we may truly protect the Empire from any threat. Every unicorn mare shall be recruited. They have no choice. It is their perfect sacrifice to Daybreaker."
  SLW_imperial_science:0 "Imperial Science"
  SLW_imperial_science_desc:0 "Clearly one of the reasons for why so many ponies fell to Celestia's Harmonist fables was because they were not educated in proper Imperial doctrine. Instructors and teachers of the laypony class have been given too much leniency; now they will be replaced with priestesses, who can properly guide our young and their impressionable minds."
  SLW_adoratio_primacy:0 "Adoratio Primacy"
  SLW_adoratio_primacy_desc:0 "As it is larger, the Solaris Adoratio should be given priority in government and furture policies. Through allocating more funding to it, we can inspire our populace to follow Daybreaker to the brink of death, with a priestess around every corner to push them to greatness."
  SLW_inquisitionis_primacy:0 "Inquisitionis Primacy"
  SLW_inquisitionis_primacy_desc:0 "Since the Inquisitionis is the branch that actually protects against heresy, we should allow it further priority than it already has in governmental decisions. How can they plausibly guard the Empire if they do not have an inquisitor to follow every single pony in the Empire, after all?"
  SLW_reignite_war_forges:0 "War Forges Reignited"
  SLW_reignite_war_forges_desc:0 "Many factories and smelteries have lain dormant since the end of the civil war. This is a crime against all of ponykind, for how are we to rebuild if we cannot defend ourselves? We shall dedicate everything to upping our production, beginning with new work shifts for the workers..."
  SLW_solarist_restored:0 "A Solarist Restored"
  SLW_solarist_restored_desc:0 "Sunset Shimmer and some of thsoe who were part of her quest to "save" Daybreaker have been observed and denied any restitution with the Solar Cult since the war has ended. However, there has been no worries from any of them regarding their loyalty, and it is time that they all take their places again, although Sunset will have to accept a lower rank than before."
  SLW_honor_eldest:0 "Honor the Eldest"
  SLW_honor_eldest_desc:0 "It is uncommon for age to be a signifier of respect in the Empire. But the savior of the Empire, Midwinter Halo, deserves recognition. As a faithful servant for many years, it is time that the Prefectess bless her with a unique position, to signify her importance to the Empire, forever."
  SLW_new_tithes:0 "Levy New Tithes"
  SLW_new_tithes_desc:0 "Ponies complain about taxes but they are, quite frankly, not extracted from enough! The Empire has expanded beyond its former needs after integrating the Cult, and to that end, more revenue is needed. We shall make a tithe for every single service, and then some, and it shall be an offer the laypony cannot refuse."
  SLW_empire_church:0 "The Church of the Solar Empire"
  SLW_empire_church_desc:0 ""Daybreaker, who art in Aetheria: Hallowed by thy name; thy Flame guide us; and your Holy Light provide wisdom to us.\nLead us in this new chapter of your Equestrian Empire, and empower our weapons that we may smite the heretic where they stand.\nProtect us as we carry out thy will!\nSol Invicta!""
  
  ###War Trees###
  SLW_awake_and_angry:0 "Awake and Angry"
  SLW_awake_and_angry_desc:0 "The former regions of the Empire have laughed at us for long enough. Their days are numbered, for we will engulf them in a firestorm that will leave none alive!"
  SLW_demonstrate_strength:0 "Demonstrate the Empress's Strength"
  SLW_demonstrate_strength_desc:0 "Nopony will expect it. While the traitors in the heartlands prepare their pathetic armies against us, we will strike at the heart of one rebellion: the birthplace of the communist revolution."
  SLW_adapt:0 "Adapt"
  SLW_adapt_desc:0 "Winters are harsh in the northern reaches of Stalliongrad, and our weapony was not intended to be used in such extreme conditions. As not much testing as been done, the matrices that power many of our vehicles could refuse to work or they could explode in their chambers. Extensive retrofitting will have to be done, and quickly, to ensure the Militarium is ready for Stalliongrad."
  SLW_overcome:0 "Overcome"
  SLW_overcome_desc:0 "[SLW.GetNameDefCap] will not fall prey to the wiles of the Stalliongradian environment. What do we need to prepare for, when we can simply level any resistance from a safe distance? Stalliongrad will fear the rumble of our guns before they are shelled into oblivion!"
  SLW_winter_spell_matrices:0 "Winterized Spell Matrices"
  SLW_winter_spell_matrices_desc:0 "In a not completely unexpected twist, our initial design alterations to fit Stalliongrad's were woefully inadequate for the harshest of the communists' winters. Therefore, further tinkering with the functionality of weapons and vehicles will be needed, including infusions with heat spells, and other ways to keep the crystals from shattering from the slightest bump in the cold."
  SLW_death_machines:0 "Machines of Death"
  SLW_death_machines_desc:0 "The open plains of southern Stalliongrad have proven the utility and practicality of our few battle tank designs, as they have swept across enemy lines and achieved multiple victories. We should further pursue this, while we have the chance to learn from Stalliongrad's own tank program."
  SLW_vaporize_wastes:0 "Vaporize the Snowy Wastes"
  SLW_vaporize_wastes_desc:0 "Everything can be solved by lobbing more shells at it. The ice and snow will be turned to slag so that we may cross Stalliongrad's plains and forests unopposed and decimate any resistance in our path."
  SLW_slice_STG_up:0 "Slice Off Stalliongrad's Head"
  SLW_slice_STG_up_desc:0 "One of Stalliongrad's strengths is its centralized command structure. One of its weaknesses is its centralized command structure. While the Militarium suffers from a similar blight, we can order strikes on rear lines in attempts to eliminating an army's commander, leaving their forces in disarry while we decapitate their forces in a precise attack."
  SLW_eradicate_evidence:0 "Eradicate Evidence of Communism"
  SLW_eradicate_evidence_desc:0 "Communism has been a blight on society since it was first conceived by Caramel Marks. Every statue, every building, every book that makes mention of this heretical doctrine will be destroyed, starting with the origin of it all: Caramel Marks' residence. Heavy resistance should be expected, but it will ponies saving us having to file paperwork for death warrants."
  SLW_plunder_lowlands:0 "Plunder the Lowlands"
  SLW_plunder_lowlands_desc:0 "Much wealth has been stored in the southern territories of Stalliongrad and its puppets. Much of that has been stolen from the Empire when Stalliongrad snatched the Prench region from us. It's time we returned the favor, and brought them all back into the fold while we take what is rightfully ours from their greedy hooves."
  SLW_mockers_and_heretics:0 "Mockers and Heretics"
  SLW_mockers_and_heretics_desc:0 "We are still surrounded by enemies on our southern borders. Two of the most egregious are [CLD.GetNameDef] and [CER.GetNameDef], who have proved nothing but thorns in our sides since they abandoned us. Now that we have proven our capability, it is time to dole out their reward: a slow and painful death."
  SLW_complete_idiots:0 "Fools Everywhere"
  SLW_complete_idiots_desc:0 "Anypony who does not submit to the will of the Empress is a blind fool, for how else could they be so stupid to go against her? Technocrats, communists, traitors; all of those we have in droves to our north, but they shall see a swift end at the hooves of our soldiers."
  SLW_lockdown_everypony:0 "Lockdown Everypony"
  SLW_lockdown_everypony_desc:0 "The level of tenacity that the wayward ponies we reclaimed resist us is unexpected. Every new territory must be locked down completely, so that the Militarium can have an easier time policing the populace until they have accepted their true masters. Anypony caught breaking quarantine shall be executed, as they have proved their heretical thoughts then and there."
  SLW_pacify_cities:0 "Pacify the Cities"
  SLW_pacify_cities_desc:0 "Due to our rapid reconquest, we have not had the time to properly garrison the various settlements and enforce Imperial law upon them.

  ###Post-war Coring Tree###
  SLW_heretics_everywhere:0 "Heretics Behind Every Bale"
  SLW_heretics_everywhere_desc:0 "Our returned territories were breeding grounds for sedition and heresy for a generation. There is no easy cure for something so corrupted and twisted, save by the purifying light of the Empress's Holy Flame."
  SLW_remove_heresy:0 "Surgically Remove Heresy"
  SLW_remove_heresy_desc:0 "While there is unfathomable numbers of heretics that have lived in the rump states surrounding us, there are others who are ambivalent or eager to be under our rule again. There is no need to be heavy-hoofed about punishment. After all, it is best we put the Solaris Speculatores to work every so often to sniff out true heresy."
  SLW_false_heresy:0 "Fabricate False Accusations"
  SLW_false_heresy_desc:0 "The search for heretics has turned up far fewer than we previously believed existed. This cannot be! Where are the droves of heretics, rebels, and partisans? We have promised the Empire blood for the suffering it received through these ponies' actions, and we will provide it. By any means necessary."
  SLW_topple_monuments:0 "Topple Their Monuments"
  SLW_topple_monuments_desc:0 "Ponies living outside the Empire had the gall to erect statues or dedicate buildings in honor of their own backstabbing "rulers" without rightfully acknowledging the Empress as the one who deserves all glory and worship. Every monument must be wiped out, lest they spread thoughts to other ponies to resist our rule."
  SLW_find_evidence:0 "Sniff Out Evidence"
  SLW_find_evidence_desc:0 "The heretics may be hidden, but few ponies can fully evade the combined efforts of the Solaris Speculatores and Inquisitionis. Snippets of conversation, occasional paper trails, or other inklings of secret cells are only the tip of the iceberg on what the faithful will search for. Nopony will escape us. Nopony."
  SLW_arrest_supsicious:0 "Arrest Anypony Suspicious"
  SLW_arrest_supsicious_desc:0 "As the embodiment of the Empress's law, the Inquisitionis has the right to detain anypony whom they deem to be suspected of heresy. Some of these ponies may resist, since they believe they have the right to a fair hearing. But when has that ever stopped us?"
  SLW_solar_lebensraum:0 "More Living Space for the Faithful"
  SLW_solar_lebensraum_desc:0 "Residing in our new lands are many creatures who are barely worth acknowledgement. Changelings, yaks, griffons, and of course heretical ponies themselves. These do not deserve the earth on which they sit. We shall send settlers to reclaim it, and if any of them resist, they will be executed on the spot. They never owned it, anyway."
  SLW_greatest_purge:0 "The Greatest Purge"
  SLW_greatest_purge_desc:0 "There has still not been enough cleansing to account for the believed heresy. We must dispense of any pretense: an order will go out to every inquisitor, every soldier. Wipe out a tenth of every settlement. We must nip any future heresy in the bud, here and now!"
  SLW_stamp_resistance:0 "Stamp out the Resistance"
  SLW_stamp_resistance_desc:0 "After months of searching, we can conclude that the actual number of heretical cells is far less than we believed, but that doesn't mean that we've come up empty. There are numerous in [CLD.GetNameDef]'s or [CER.GetNameDef]'s territory alone, and it will be more than enough to set examples for future conquests."
  SLW_adoratio_missionaries:0 "Missionaries from the Adoratio"
  SLW_adoratio_missionaries_desc:0 "There are so many who have not heard the good news of Daybreaker's salvation! This was one of the original intentions of the Solaris Adoratio to begin with, and it is now time to preach to the unwashed masses again! All will love the Empress as we do, and if they don't, they shall be sent to the Holy Flame to be purified forever."
  SLW_dominion_across_equus:0 "Dominion Across Equus"
  SLW_dominion_across_equus_desc:0 "We have achieved our end goal of integrating and pacifying the nations that broke from us decades ago. Heresy has subsided, and ponies have acknowledged [SLW.GetLeader]'s right to rule. It is time we turned our attention elsewhere: to the "nation" that started it all."

  SLW_pound_to_dust:0 "Pound Them To Dust"
  SLW_pound_to_dust_desc:0 "The first time we fought in the South-east, we were halted by the hit and run tactics of the different groups fighting for their "freedom." This time we have come prepared, and we will bring with us new ways to flatten their hideaways before they have a chance to strike at us."
  SLW_fight_like_bats:0 "Fight Like the Bats"
  SLW_fight_like_bats_desc:0 "Thestrals were part of the reason we were pushed back when Daybreaker led us into the penninsula before, using their unnatural crepuscular tendancies and maneuverability to poke out of remote jungle and mountain settlements and then slip away. We can take a page from their book, at least when it comes to fighting in disadvantageous terrain."
  SLW_rein_in_communists:0 "Rein in the Communists"
  SLW_rein_in_communists_desc:0 "A majority of the northern half of the South-east has succumbed to the lies and promises of [BAL.GetLeader]. MARESOC, Socialist, Markist, Sinisterist. They all spout untruths to get ponies to follow them and wander astray. Some well-placed executions will show what happens when ponies are deceived and willingly abandon the Empress."
  SLW_baltimares_end:0 "Baltimare's End, Finale"
  SLW_baltimares_end_desc:0 "Once the jewel of the South-east, Baltimare has fallen into disgrace as [BAL.GetLeader] has tightened the governemnt's control and given the entire city into its vices and ignorance. When we first came here, we almost leveled the city, but were pushed back by MARESOC's untimely arrival. We won't be stopped again."
  SLW_introduce_flame:0 "Introduce the Holy Flame"
  SLW_introduce_flame_desc:0 "The thestrals have been beaten back to their hovels and villages, where they cower in anticipation of their eternal punishment.

  SLW_defiant_no_longer:0 "Defiant No Longer"
  SLW_defiant_no_longer_desc:0 "Both under Baltimare's control, and now under our guidance, the southern half of the penninsula has remained stubbornly resistant to any attempts of occupation. It's time we turn up the heat, and flush out from the festering jungles these rebels and bring the region to heel."
  SLW_repair_mistakes:0 "Repair the Empire's Mistake"
  SLW_repair_mistakes_desc:0 "Ponies have argued for decades what started the Empire's decline. Most have argued that it was Celestia's failing that allowed the changelings to snatch half our territory, but if the South-east had not slipped away, we could have brought the bugs under boot much sooner. Today, the [GetNovaTitle] has righted this wrong and cemented herself in greatest of history!"
  
  ###CHN and CRY Tree###
  SLW_solarist_hegemony:0 "Solarist Hegemony"
  SLW_solarist_hegemony_desc:0 "We stand as one of the true superpowers of Equus again, and are close to retaking our lost territory from the cursed changelings. We only have a couple of roadblocks left in our way before we can declare complete dominance on the continent."
  SLW_repay_owed:0 "Repay What is Owed"
  SLW_repay_owed_desc:0 "The claim is it was by sheer luck that a passing patrol captured [CHN.GetName]'s Queen Chrysalis as she attempted to flee on hoof through one of the supply trains that have been going through Vesalipolis, but the [GetNovaTitle] knows better. By providence or fate, the scourge of the Empire has been delivered into our hooves. We mustn't waste this opportunity."
  SLW_suffer_slowly:0 "Let them Suffer, Slowly"
  SLW_suffer_slowly_desc:0 "Like our brethren that have been starved, beaten, and killed for the amusement of the changelings, we have intentions for our former oppressors. The Inquisitionis has been drafting up ways of utilizing them to their fullest extent, and it is sure to be painful. And when they beg for mercy, we will only give them the kiss of hard labor until they perish."
  SLW_new_monuments:0 "Crystal Monuments to the Empress"
  SLW_new_monuments_desc:0 "[CRY.GetNameDefCap] stabbed us in the back when we relied on their help in the Great War, and for that they shall have their collective memory erased. With a new degree, the [GetNovaTitle] has decreed that the entire city will be repurposed into a monument to the Empire, for all to look on and despair."
  SLW_homeland:0 "Homeland of Ponies"
  SLW_homeland_desc:0 "Despite the years, the land that the Hegemony had snatched from us remains our dejure territory, and it has yearned for our return for decades. With the liberation of our ensnared brethren, the land has already begun to heal, and we have begun integrating the various cities back into the Empire."
  SLW_waste_not:0 "Waste Not Want Not"
  SLW_waste_not_desc:0 "The Hegemony did not have time to scuttle their ships when we finally overran their territory and captured the shipyards of Ditrysium, and we now have a swelling of warships of all sizes, as well as a sizeable submarine flotilla. These may not be as intricate as ours, but we can't look a gift horse in the mouth, as it were."
  SLW_drill_depths:0 "Drill to the Depths of Tartarus"
  SLW_drill_depths_desc:0 "[CRY.GetNameDefCap] foolishly let much of its natural resources still rot in the ground instead of utilizing them. With our influx of fresh bodies after the war, there is ample opportunity to rectify that problem."
  SLW_new_territory:0 "A New Imperial Territory"
  SLW_new_territory_desc:0 "One of Equestria's many mistakes throughout its lifetime before the Great War, aside from humoring the ridiculous ideals of Harmony, was never formally annexing the Crystal Empire when it had ample opportunity to do so. If they had direct administrative control, perhaps the Great War would have turned out differently. However, the Crystal Ponies will not get the same liberties again."
  SLW_bug_land:0 "Snatch the Bugs' Land"
  SLW_bug_land_desc:0 "While we're here, we might as well take a bit more. Our ponies could use a smidgen more living room in the northern stretches of the Empire."
  SLW_equus_hegemony:0 "Hegemony Across Equus"
  SLW_equus_hegemony_desc:0 "It is not enough that we have toppled the changelings or corrected the wayward Crystal Empire. There are still those on Equus who do not bend the knee to the Empress and live in complete ignorance of their heresy and apostasy. We must bring the light of the sun to them all."
  
  ###EQC Tree###
  SLW_last_heresy:0 "The Final Heresy"
  SLW_last_heresy_desc:0 "At last, our situation on Equus is secured, and with that, we can direct our entire efforts toward the instigator of every ill that has occurred in this last half-century. [EQC.GetName] has been tolerated for too long, and they will be cleansed with the bright light of the Holy Flame."
  SLW_no_innocent:0 "Nopony is Innocent"
  SLW_no_innocent_desc:0 "Everypony from a young age in [EQC.GetName] has been brainwashed into believing the lies of the MARESOC and [EQC.GetLeader], so not a single pony is innocent and willing to aid us. If anypony seems open to our help, it is a trap, and we must react accordingly. The Militarium must shoot to kill. Always."
  SLW_setting_sun:0 "Setting of the Sun"
  SLW_setting_sun_desc:0 "It is fitting that MARESOC has never changed the name of Sunset, as it will be a monument to the destruction of their regime as we send it into the raging inferno of the evening sun!"
  SLW_crude_copy:0 "A Crude Copy"
  SLW_crude_copy_desc:0 "In an ultimate defiance of their predecessors, MARESOC has had the gall to the declare the former New Manehattan colony as the one and only Manehattan in the world. They have attempted to carve reconstructions of our greatest monuments there, but have failed miserably. They willl not live long to remember, however."
  SLW_dual_empress:0 "Dual-Prefectess"
  SLW_dual_empress_desc:0 "The last heretics have fallen. As we emerge victorious, we stand dominant over two great continents, and we can spread the might of the Empress to every nook and cranny of the world! There has been only one pony who has led us to this point, [GetNovaTitle] [SLW.GetLeader]. Praise to her, the dual-[GetNovaTitle]!"
  
  ###Communist Decisions Tree###
  SLW_meeting_devil:0 "Meeting with the Devil"
  SLW_meeting_devil_desc:0 "Among the communists' many, many demands, their leader, Smoldering Carbon, has requested to meet with the [GetNovaTitle] to discuss things in detail and in good faith. It is preposterious! The [GetNovaTitle] would never meet with scum like them! Do they wish to command the day while they are at it?"
  SLW_hear_their_side:0 "Hear Out the Other Side"
  SLW_hear_their_side_desc:0 "There have been many levelheaded requests and complaints from the communists, and even the ones that were voiced with more... passion carried strong points. We cannot just execute all of them, and the Empress had the wisdom to allow some tolerance. Perhaps we should send negotiators to the various outward groups and learn more."
  SLW_provide_audience:0 "Provide an Audience with Nova"
  SLW_provide_audience_desc:0 "Surprisingly, the [GetNovaTitle] has agreed to meet with Smoldering Carbon. Orders have been dispatched to prepare the grandest ceremonies, although even Nova Glow has admitted curiosity if this will impress, intimidate, or irritate Smoldering while meeting."
  SLW_safer_industry:0 "A Safer Industry"
  SLW_safer_industry_desc:0 "We could have simply wiped the communists and unions of the face of the planet, but the [GetNovaTitle] decided in her wisdom to allow them to be heard. Now their ideas have spread further, and we have no choice but to concede. This will at least buy us peace, but at what cost in the future?"
  SLW_never_negotiate:0 "Never Negotiate"
  SLW_never_negotiate_desc:0 "There is a simple policy in the Solar Empire from the Solaris Inquistionis: never negotiate with terrorists and heretics. Each and every pony decrying the "unfairness" in the Empire has proven their disloyalty, and they have signed their own death warrants." 
  SLW_pulverize_protesters:0 "Pulverize the Protests"
  SLW_pulverize_protesters_desc:0 "We cannot allow further destablization of the Empire through these whelps' pity parties. By the end of the day, every garrison in the Militarium will be equipped and given instructions, and these protesters will be rounded up and arrested. Let us hope there's no spark of violence in any of them..."
  SLW_monitor_members:0 "Monitor the Members"
  SLW_monitor_members_desc:0 "There are thousands of members of various underground unions that have sprung to light, and while they have not technically committed any heretical acts, nor have they joined their fellows in dissent against the Empress, they must be observed. One wrong move, and they will wish they were never born."
  SLW_lob_heads:0 "Lob off the Heads"
  SLW_lob_heads_desc:0 "As of yet, there has not been definitive proof that Smoldering Carbon or others of her inner circle were behind some of the more violent protests, but evidence has surfaced through the Speculatores that she encouraged the ponies in Manehattan to rebel, just as much as Starlight and Trixie were involved. A raid will be conducted at once, and she will rue the day she thought she could outwit the Empress."

As she is descended from one of the many noble houses of Sanctum Solar, she frequently meddles in things beyond her purview. With her hooves in so many pies, she tends to keep a charisma about her that is able to distract from her true intentions.

A sub-branch of the Solaris Militarium, the Praetorian Guard acts completely autonomously from the rest of the Solar Empire's military and government, fully dedicated to their sole duty of protecting the Empress from harm.

An orphan from the Southeast's war of independence, she was raised in a household that resisted the order that Daybreaker had set up. Yet this only drove her resolve of anti-heresy further, which in turn fueled eventual punishment from her adoptive family.\n\nIn 1029, she was able to finally alert the Inquisitionis to her family and turned them in herself, as she brought Ordo Multi inquisitors to her abode. Only a single member escaped, and she was soon seen as a potential devotee of the cult, which led to placement in one of the religious schools in Manehattan.\n\nAfter showing enough promise to be sent to Daybreaker's school for training mages and archmages, she reached her limit, barely passing and receiving a stationing back in Ordo Multi. Under its newest archmage, Nebula Flare, she learned some more abilities while practicing physical warfare with her fellow mage, Aurora Shinespark.\n\nAs a fairly reserved pony, she grew close with Nebula before her mentor fled as an exposed heretic, which pushed Nova further into her drive to eliminate it. Aurora was made archmage in Nebula's stead, leaving Nova with the same rank she held before, something that niggled her for years.\n\nIn the civil war with Equestria, Nova proved herself capable as a general, and unwholly loyal to Daybreaker. Now as the Prefectess of the Solar Empire, she has been tasked with filling the shoes of her God-Empress in guiding the Empire to new heights. Yet coming on the heels of an omnipotent, omniscient goddess is a massive task, and it remains to be seen if she can handle the pressure.\n\nIt was an inevitability that a pony pushed so greatly would eventually break. Proclaiming herself the second coming of Daybreaker, Nova has usurped the title of Empress and become its new Empress-Prefectess. Executions have already been lined up for the last of those who question her sanity, and she has already spoken of how she will repair the Empire.
