  career_archmage:0 "Career Archmage"
  career_archmage_desc:0 "Seething Corona has been the archmage of Ordo Solis since its inception. As she is descended from one of the many nobles houses of Sanctum Solar, she frequently meddles in things beyond her purview. With her hooves in so many pies, she tends to keep a charisma about her that is able to distract from her true intentions. That doesn't really lend well to a position as general, however, which hampers her units' offensive capabilities in battle."
  praetorian_guard_commander:0 "Praetorian General"
  praetorian_guard_commander_desc:0 "The current commander of the elite Praetorian Guard of Sanctum Solar. A sub-branch of the Solaris Militarium, the Praetorian Guard acts completely autonomously from the rest of the Solar Empire's military and government, fully dedicated to their sole duty of protecting the Empress from harm. Only the most talented of soldiers are turned into a hulking Praetorian, and it requires true grit to rise to the top of them all."
  giant_stick:0 "Hulking Brute"
  giant_stick_desc:0 "A fanatical loyalist to Daybreaker, Thundering Hoofbeat ensures that his entire command is tasked with defending her and the Empire at all costs, for as long as they need. The magics used to give him his incredible strength have hampered some of his higher preservation instincts, and he has no issue performing the same failed tactics again and again until they work."
