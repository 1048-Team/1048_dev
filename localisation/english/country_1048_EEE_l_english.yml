  EEE_tribal_confederation_category_desc:0 "Aside from §C[BAT.GetNameDef]§! there has never been a united thestral nation, as the ratio of thestrals to other ponies is miniscule. When the majority of the thestral populace from Hollow Shades fled §ODaybreaker's§! rule, they settled within the South-East, in §YAyacachtli§! and centralized the Equus thestral population. While thestrals are no less civilized, they have maintained a de facto tribal structure for generations, and our claimed territory is less a country and more a loose conglomeration of villages, towns, and hamlets scattered throughout the jungle.\n\nCurrently, those on the §YMoonspeaker Council§! are seen as the rightful leaders of the thestrals tribes, on a purely honorary basis. In light of the Council's failure to protect against the §RNeighua uprising§!, voices have been raised about fully uniting and putting down our rivals for good. The two loudest advocates for removing the Moonspeakers from power are §RRed Dusk§! and §CTranquil Serenade§!. Red Dusk is popular with the working class, while Tranquil Serenade has made in-roads with the outlying tribes. However, the Council still has influence within Ayacachtli, and §GStellar Note§! has promised to reform them if trust is left in her.\n\nAll possible candidates are currently vying for the most support while lowering the others' standing in the tribes' eyes. When the tribal leaders finally convene, they will decide who will be given the reins of the nation based on who has wooed them hardest."

  ###Leader Descriptions###
  POLITICS_DESC_STELLAR_NOTE:0 "§YBorn:§! 1st of March, 1012 ALB in Ayacachtli\n\n§YBiography:§! Although she has only been the leader of the Moonspeaker Council for six months, the time that she has spent in charge has felt more like six decades to Stellar Note. Her tenure has been marked by increased anti-corruption efforts and consistent shuffling of the council as Moonspeakers on it have been found to be either in backroom deals with COBSOC that led to further problems under their control, or suspect ties to a mysterious pony known only as the Conductor.\n\nWhile Stellar has stepped up to her role, she had far more humble beginnings. Neither of her parents were members of the Moonspeaker clergy, and it was only through desperate circumstances that she was relinquished to them to ensure she had both an education and enough food to eat. Like many of the other destitute families in the South-East before and after the rise of Cobalt Hoof, hers struggled for the basics, as the well-to-do in Ayacachtli ignored them.\n\nUnder the tutelage of the Moonspeakers, Stellar was encouraged to feed her inquisitive nature and study as much as she could. Although she was too young to fully notice or comprehend the secession war with the Solar Empire, she still felt some of its consequences. She watched from the sidelines as a short-lived spat between the previous Moonspeaker Council head, Waxing Crescent, and a captain of various thestral war bands broke into violence, and was nearly injured herself as Moonspeakers and tribal fighters brawled outside the Temple of the Moon.\n\nIn the ensuing years, she continued her studies and grew more questioning of the Moonspeakers' wisdom. After both failed attempts at shrugging off COBSOC's rule, she placed her name on the ballot for the council, and was chosen due to her amicable and thoughtful demeanor. Now in charge of the Moonspeaker Council, she is left keeping the peace, and striving to prove to thestrals that, despite their flaws, the Moonspeakers have the best intention of their people at heart.\n\n§YPortrait By:§! Nnaly"
  POLITICS_DESC_TRANQUIL_SERENADE:0 "§YBorn:§! 10th of April, 1029 ALB in Misty Point Prison Camp\n\n§YBiography:§! Possibly the youngest leader to ever attempt something within the thestral tribes, Tranquil Serenade is highly ambitious, to the point of sacrificing all else to achieve her goals. From her earliest days, she has never experienced the liberty or harmony that her parents or other elders spoke of as she grew up, which has romanticized the ideal to be nothing more than what she would love to see.\n\nTranquil's birthplace was not by choice. As her parents were first warriors who fought with COBSOC against the Solar Empire and then later guerillas against Cobalt Hoof's oppressive regime, they never intended to have her on the Dragon Isle's prison camps. At the time of their capture, her mother's pregnancy was unknown, and her naming was more of a reminder to her parents what they had lost in their captivity than out of any love for the words. On the island itself, she and her parents were pushed to extremes, and she and they were left in a camp almost entirely made up of other thestrals.\n\nTo foil most guards' understanding of their conversation, the thestral tongue was primarily used, which left Tranquil's Ponish significantly weaker than most of her peers on the mainland. Although she can speak it, she has a permanent, hissy lisp to her speech, which has further cemented opponents' perception of her as a young, naive ideologue.\n\nFrom the camp of Misty Point, on clear days and when she was allowed to fly higher, she could see the foggy coast of the mainland, and her parents frequently told her stories of what it was like before the madness of Daybreaker or Cobalt Hoof. They all dreamed to one day return to help their kind, but in the year before COBSOC collapsed, her parents were killed in a failed prison break. Left orphaned, Tranquil did what she could to honor their memory, and gathered support among other inmates, waiting for the perfect time to strike.\n\nAfter COBSOC collapsed, she escaped with them and first saw the jungles of the South-East. Her romanticization of liberty and harmony, as well as her youth have drawn criticism from conservative thestrals, but the younger generations support her and her efforts. As a rabid anti-communist, she frequently butts head with Red Dusk, a fellow reformer of the thestral nation. Between their political bickering, it remains to be seen if the thestrals can ever truly hope for the independence they crave.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! Julunis14"
  POLITICS_DESC_RED_DUSK:0 "§YBorn:§! 7th of July, 1026 ALB in Stableside\n\n§YBiography:§! A bright, if arrogant worker from Stableside, Red Dusk is part of the minority diaspora of thestrals that have moved around the South-East. From his time working in the floor and later the management of multiple factories in Stableside, he has some of the most industrial sense of all those within the central jungle, and has seen first-hoof some of the failures of COBSOC's system and Lucky Star's control.\n\nAfter the South-East's liberation and the integration of the thestral populace, all thestrals were given citizenship in Cobalt Hoof's self-proclaimed utopia. For the brief window that there was freedom of movement, Red Dusk's parents emigrated to Stableside, which had suffered less damage in the war versus Baltimare or Tenochtitlan. When he was born, he experienced the same living conditions as every other working class family underneath Cobalt Hoof. They technically were surviving, but just enough to trust him for more.\n\nIn his teen years, he heard and saw the news about the brave soldiers of COBSOC putting down another rebellion in the thestral homelands, which opened his eyes to some of the plights that his ponies specifically faced compared to others. While thestrals were seen as equal, there was still derision, laced in generations of prejudice for "helping" Nightmare Moon. Although he was never formally educated, he began to lap up any of the documents that the war hero, Oxide, penned, especially as they grew critical of Lucky Star and Cobalt Hoof.\n\nWith the collapse of COBSOC, Lucky Star seized control of much of the peninsula, and grew to be just as harsh as Cobalt, yet as his grip slipped, Red Dusk and some of his fellow thestrals decided to make the trip to Ayacachtli, which was now independent, and stepped into the chaos that the Moonspeakers were barely handling. Like another political prisoner of COBSOC, Tranquil Serenade, he wishes to see thestrals free of any influence of Daybreaker or other tyrants, but also believes that Caramel Marks knew the right path to freedom. Both she and he frequently butt heads over the direction the thestrals should follow, which has only made the future of the nation fall further into doubt."
  POLITICS_DESC_NOCTURNE_VISION_1:0 "§YBorn:§! March 5th, 1005 ALB outside of Ayacachtli\n\n§YBiography:§! Nocturne Vision is one of the longer-standing councilors on the Moonspeaker Council and has remained a trusted voice of solid—if sometimes biting and sarcastic—reason whenever the council itself broke down into bickering. As she was raised in one of the deep jungle villages, she has had to navigate difficulty after difficulty, beginning with merely surviving the independence war with the Solar Empire. From a young age, she has been used to living under an authoritarian hoof, and the new bout of liberty that the thestrals have experienced has given her a louder position than before.\n\nLike many thestrals who grew up before the Great War, Nocturne experienced a heavily communal, village-led lifestyle, which wasn't interrupted greatly by the advent of the war with the changelings. Although she and her older brother, Sonnet, were not old enough to serve with the thestrals who left in 1012 to help, she and him both kept constant watch on news reports about the plucky few who volunteered to take the fight to Chrysalis. In between these, she frequently trailed her brother, who was learning to be a trailblazer for village expansion and the eventual railroad network that Princess Celestia had promised the South-East. However, the collapse of Equestria and its reformation into the Solar Empire stymied those plans.\n\nWhen COBSOC declared a war for independence, and the thestrals de facto threw their lots in with him a year later in 1017, Sonnet left with others from Nocturne's village to repel Daybreaker, which left Nocturne to stay at home and help organizing war efforts there. According to official records, Sonnet died during the war, and Nocturne eventually migrated to Ayacachtli to study under the Moonspeakers when she was noticed to have a keen mind and eye for details. She was elected to the council within five years of moving to Ayacachtli, shortly after the first uprising in 1028.\n\nSince her appointment to the council, Nocturne has been behind a number of initiatives to keep the thestral militia prepared and the city safe. After a series of crime waves in 1039, she completely reorganized the police structure, and also established a secondary guard in the event of wide-scale riots. Through it all, she has remained steadfast in her conviction. She takes particular interest in murders, and has uncovered a number of serial killers that have infested Ayacachtli as of late, and has sworn to scour the streets until every thestral can live in safety\n\n§YPortrait By:§! KranoNetwork"
  POLITICS_DESC_NOCTURNE_VISION_2:0 "§YBorn:§! March 5th, 1005 ALB outside of Ayacachtli\n\n§YBiography:§! An easy life is not one that is natural to Nocturne Vision, between everything has rocked her family and the necessity for lies to maintain her cover. Moonspeaker councilor, devoted sister, unwavering leader, sardonic foe. To different ponies she is different things, but it is only out of necessity that she and her Custodiens Nocte have remained hidden for so many years.\n\nWhile Nocturne was indeed raised in a village before the Great War, and it was in the deep jungle, she experienced far more of COBSOC's independence war than she let on while on the Moonspeaker Council. She and her brother, Sonnet, both worked on trailblazing apprenticeships, but when the war broke out and given it was a life or death situation for all of thestralkind, Sonnet volunteered with the first wave of warriors in a heartbeat. The young Nocturne, while ostensibly under the age of acceptance into the fight, was ignored, as her loyalty and love for her brother, as well as her sharp eye for detail, helped her squad defend against numerous ambushes and attacks by the Solarists.\n\nAs the squad's notoriety grew, so did its members, and one of its most junior, Gushing Pulse, rubbed her the wrong way. During the height of the war, she was recalled back to her home village, due to a sudden crisis within her family. Sonnet was ordered back, too, but refused, at the egging by Gushing Pulse. Nocturne never saw her brother again, alive, anyway.\n\nAfter assisting her parents with her grandparents' burial, she attempted to find Sonnet again, but when she met with the squad after the war concluded, they had said he went with Gushing Pulse to her village. The two were very much in love, according to them. However, instead of a thestral village, Nocturne, through no small feat of tracking, traced Gushing and Sonnet to the site of an ancient temple, with symbolism of the moon chiseled everywhere upon its surface. She could only watch from the sidelines as Gushing Pulse, now obvious a member of some death cult, drove a knife into Sonnet's chest so he could be a sacrifice for some strange god.\n\nWere it not for the intervention of other observers, she would have perished that night, as she sought to avenge her brother. Instead, though, she was found by two Custodien knights, and taken to be trained in Ayacachtli. Under cover as a Moonspeaker, she ascended to the council and only when the ancient Ezmetzli death cult revealed itself through Gushing's cockiness felt the time right to demand control. Now that the South-East is under her protection, she will ensure that thestrals and ponies of all shapes and sizes can live in peace and safety. She's promised that the "Eternal Song" will guide and guard them. She will only be their last resort.\n\n§YPortrait By:§! KranoNetwork"
  POLITICS_DESC_GUSHING_PULSE_1:0 "§YBorn:§! July 29th, 1007 ALB in a remote jungle village\n\n§YBiography:§! Gushing Pulse is the leader of a local village buried deep within the jungle of the South-East, and is a proponent of military readiness the thestrals have never before held. In Ayacachtli, she is only seen sporadically, as she travels infrequently from her home to the capital to petition the Moonspeaker Council or to simply trade some of the wares her artisans create for supplies that they cannot make themselves.\n\nLittle is known about her directly, although she has said that she fought in the liberation war against Daybreaker. As filly, she frequently explains, she had much exposure to hardships and survival, as her parents were destitute and all of them scavenged as much as they could in the ruins that dotted the South-East for anything that could give them meals for the following days. With Princess Celestia's societal reforms, there was hope for a better future for her, but Daybreaker's ascension knocked all of that down. When the war led by COBSOC erupted and thestrals joined the fray, her parents were some of the first to enlist with village war bands that went out.\n\nHowever, they barely survived two months of the war, and with only herself to provide for, she attempted to volunteer for the next band joining. She was denied, as she was underage, and spent the next few years surviving as best she could, earning trust within her village as she helped to resolve some disputes between long-standing blood feuds. When asked to elaborate further, she has stated that it not the business of outsiders, as it is seen as a personal insult in her village to dig into matters. What is in the past is in the past, as she has explained.\n\nAlthough the rest of her tribe remains rather isolated, she has promised that would there ever be a need, she can be trusted to join for the defense of the thestral nation. Since the election of Stellar Note, she has become more active in Ayacacthli, and appears most interested in what the new council leader will do. Although her confidence comes across as brash cockiness, it is not without result. She seems to be a competent leader, and certainly one that would be good to keep in case of external invasion of the nation. Her love of mangoes is perturbing, however, especially given how much she likes to slurp on them.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! Falafel_Jake"
  POLITICS_DESC_GUSHING_PULSE_2:0 "§YBorn:§! July 29th, 1007 ALB in a remote jungle village\n\n§YBiography:§! Very few ponies can claim that their name describes them aptly, but Gushing Pulse falls within that coveted echelon. Perhaps it is merely a quirk or coincidence, but her propensity and love of all things violent matches both her fur and mane perfectly, and she has been behind a silent reign of terror that has gripped thestral society for years.\n\nAs she has helpfully explained to some of her victims before their deaths, she was indeed raised in an isolated village, deep within the jungle. Likewise, she grew up with nothing, her parents sometimes having to find whatever waste they could to potentially have something to fill their stomachs. All the while, their innocent filly was slowly bending under the pressure of both extreme poverty and something in her head from which she could never escape. Every night, while she tried to sleep and her parents slumbered softly and without a care, she would lay awake, hearing a symphony that only she could experience. The chords of nature, the strings of the wind, and the bellow of the earth, all tainted by the breaths and disharmonious twangs of her parents' life.\n\nFor years, she suffered through the sounds, the torments, while she kept up appearances. It was something she was adept in. Some of the scraps she scavenged with her parents first exposed her to the Night Goddess, an ancient thestral deity predating Luna by millennia, but she never thought much of it. Unlike the story that she tells those that are not yet her next target, her parents did not die in the war against the Solar Empire. They did join the war bands, but they never left. They were going to abandon her. Therefore, they had no right to keep tainting the music she heard.\n\nOne fateful night, she was bathed in their blood, a rusty blade the only instrument she could use. It was not clean. It was not careful. She caused a ruckus, and the militia of her village would have soon found her, were it not for a thestral in strange robes who guided her away under cover of darkness. Only later did she recognize it as one of her own villagers, although she knew the mare as Heartbreak, she introduced herself as Hemophilia, and that Gushing was most special.\n\nUnder Hemophilia's teaching, a new home called and new family called the Ezmetzli, Gushing soon led the other moon cultists back to her village, and helped perform the first symphony to the Night Goddess in a century. While the streets ran crimson, she ascended, hearing the Eternal Song, that music in her head, clearer than ever before. It was liberating.\n\nShortly before COBSOC's collapse, Hemophilia died under suspicious circumstances. Gushing was chosen in her place, and now that she has complete domination over the thestrals, she has only one goal in mind. For the Eternal Song to be pure, society must fall. It will be done, no matter how many must die to see it happen.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! KranoNetwork"
  POLITICS_DESC_MOONLIGHT_AND_WANING:0 "§YBorn:§! 27th of July, 1021 ALB in Ayacachtli\n\n§YBiography:§! From birth, Moonlight and Waning Crescent have been members of the secretive Ezmetzli cult, as their father, Waxing Crescent, was one of the highest ranking Orchestra members, outside of the Conductor herself, Hemophilia. Not even their mother, Half Moon, knew of their involvement until it was too late, for their education in the ways of the Moon Goddess overruled any loyalty of blood relation.\n\nOstensibly, the Crescent family were generous and outgoing members of Ayacachtli society, and although the Moonspeaker Council was not appreciated after they seemingly caved to COBSOC pressure, Waxing himself was seen as a good pony. For the Ezmetzli, that suited their goals perfectly, as Waxing slowly gained favor and influence with a number of ponies on the Council itself.\n\nBoth of Waxing's foals labored in the cult's plans, as he was the primary eyes and ears for Hemophilia in Ayacachtli, while she continued listening to the Moon Goddess's directions and the Eternal Song's changing tempo. Neither sibling was blessed like she was, and they could only obey as she instructed them and their father, in trust that it would keep the Eternal Song pure. For the maturing cultists, their missions ranged from reconnaissance, to kidnapping or bribery, to murder, as long as it served the goal of cleansing the taint that others placed upon the Song. When Waxing Crescent died seemingly of a heart attack, Waning, as the more charismatic and outgoing of the two, was expected to replace him on the Council, however, she was ultimately snubbed in favor of Stellar Note.\n\nDespite being twins, they are almost perfectly dissimilar. Where Waning is full of life, energy, and zest, rarely thinking of her next steps, Moonlight is far more reserved, even-tempered, and calculating. Together, they orchestrated a number of sprees that shocked the citizens of Ayacachtli, including an assassination of an elder Moonspeaker. As Moonlight was meant to succeed Hemophilia, her sudden disappearance and appointment of Gushing Pulse strained their loyalties to the Ezmetzli, but with her presence removed, there is little to stop them from pursuing what they believe will be the Moon Goddess's wishes and reap her eternal power.\n\n§YPortrait by:§!

  ###General Traits###
  bloodlust_general:0 "Esauineminilistli"
  bloodlust_general_desc:0 "While many ponies recognize that thestrals are not bloodthirsty vampires hellbent on consuming the life essence of others, Gushing Pulse would give them pause. Extremely aggressive, to the point of being feral, she is ruthless and uncaring, sending wave after wave of soldiers to die against the enemy to satiate her desire for death. Soldiers do not have a long life expectancy under her command."
  ezmetzli_general:0 "Ezmetzli Orchestra Member"
  ezmetzli_general_desc:0 "A member of the ancient lunar cult of the thestral race, this thestral is a pursuant of night tactics and hitting hard and fast. Compared to the Solaris Adoratio, they eke out every bit of anger and hatred out of their soldiers, in exchange for pure durability of their commands."
  #moon_guardian:0 "Metspixkitl"
  moon_guardian:0 "Watcher of the Night"
  moon_guardian_desc:0 "Nocturne Vision is the grand master of the ancient Custodiens Nocte, which is dedicated to protecting against the threat of the Ezmetzli. With the onset of a greater danger, both the Custodiens and the Ezmetzli have made peace for the time being. However, she at least believes in her soldiers' worth, and it shows in the casualty results compared to Gushing Pulse."
  custodiens_nocte:0 "Custodiens Nocte Knight"
  custodiens_nocte_desc:0 "A member of the ancient lunar salvation cult the Custodiens Nocte. Dedicated to protecting the night and its beauty from the danger of nightmares from the Ezmetzli, they can always get the most information possible from any situation. Their command is sometimes pushed beyond its limits, and soldiers have frequently complained about their harsh punishments to accomplish victory."
  
  ###National Spirits###
  EEE_tribal_holdings:0 "Tribal Holdings"
  EEE_tribal_holdings_desc:0 "Much of our land is already unsuitable for building factories and industrializing, and what is there has already been claimed by the thestral tribes that live here. We can't simply kick them out, as much as we need more factories, and need them soon."
  EEE_tribal_militias:0 "Untrained Militias"
  #EEE_tribal_militias_desc:0 "Now that we have broken free from [STB.GetNameDef], there are many thestrals that wish for us to remain independent and are willing to die for that cause. Many of these warriors lack the proper skills and weapons, and we simply do not have enough personnel to train them."
  EEE_tribal_militias_desc:0 "When the Moonspeakers kept the populace placated and docile, COBSOC eventually permitted us to keep a militia for regional defense. They've been instrumental in keeping us safe and now independent with the overthrowing of the COBSOC garrison. Although they have much enthusiasm, they are poorly trained and equipped. We simply don't have the personnel or resources to fix that at this time."
  EEE_tribal_politics:0 "Distrusted Council"
  EEE_tribal_politics_desc:0 "Since the end of the war against the Solar Empire, the Moonspeakers have worked with first the communist council and later COBSOC to keep an uneasy peace over our land. The independence that we fought for was surrendered in exchange for less bloodshed. This collaboration with other oppressive regimes has left thestral society wary of the Moonspeakers and is a trust that cannot be regained easily now that they lead [EEE.GetNameDef]."
  EEE_conflicted_council:0 "Conflicted Council"
  EEE_conflicted_council_desc:0 "When the previous head councilor, Waxing Crescent, died in a tragic accident, it was expected that his daughter, Waning Crescent would be elected due to his and her popularity. Instead, Stellar Note was chosen and has gone on a campaign of removing corruption within the council. This has formed two power blocs, and very little can be done without immense debate."
  #EEE_tribal_politics_desc:0 "There are two main factions in [EEE.GetName], the Metstlis and the Tekitinis, and both have very different views on how the nation should be run. Tranquil Serenade wishes to keep us safe and ready for when [BAL.GetNameDef] eventually comes for us, while Red Dusk desires to unite all thestrals in a workers' paradise. They don't see eye-to-eye at the best of times."
  EEE_night_whispering:0 "Whispering of the Night"
  EEE_night_whispering_desc:0 "These lands are filled with some of the holiest sites of the thestral race, including temples blessed by the Moon Goddess. Whispered rumors of two ancient cults dedicated to different aspects of the Moon Goddess have persisted for generations. But they're just that: rumors. Recent disappearances within and around [30.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] have brought these tales to light again and have left fear in some of our citizens."

  thestral.999.t:0 "[ROOT.GetNameDefCap]' Savior"
  thestral.999.d:0 "The moment now lies for the taking. Trust in the Moonspeaker Council is at an all-time low with the recent loss of the territory now controlled by [NEI.GetNameDef] and with the uncertainty of the other countries that surround us in the South-East, it has made the political situation a veritable powderkeg. A civil war is not on the horizon, as we all know that thestrals must keep together if we're to survive, however, that has simply meant that the promise of a tribal confederation - a true, unified state - has become the battleground instead. Words rather than bullets and promises rather than plans will be used to win the support of the various tribes, their leaders, and the general populace. While the Moonspeaker Council still holds sway, their grip is slipping.\n\nThere are a total of three ponies that have put their names forward. Stellar Note is the current head of the Moonspeaker Council, and she has promised that once this season of instability is over, she will create a truly modern thestral country, that will be our own brand of Harmony, with thestrals the world over sharing in this purpose. Second is Red Dusk, a worker from Stableside who has gained popularity in the blue collar ranks back in Ayacachtli. When COBSOC collapsed, he traveled to the city and soon started organizing rallies and strikes for the horrible standards that have remained from Cobalt Hoof's reign. He has promised radical reforms to create a superstate across the Peninsula, and that no thestral shall go hungry under his watch. Last is Tranquil Serenade, a young thestral who escaped from the prisons set up on the Dragon Islands. She has been less concrete in her promises, but has claimed that she will make sure that the thestrals are never occupied by oppressors again. She's led a number of counter protests at Red Dusk's rallies, and has had at least one hoof fight with him. Although not stated, it can be assumed she will be heavily against COBSOC's remnants and legacy.\n\nWhoever we choose to throw our support behind will face steep competition. Only through consistent monitoring of the situation can the lucky pony win the nomination as the tribal confederation leader. Who will it be?"
  thestral.999.a:0 "Stellar Note, the progressive Moonspeaker."
  thestral.999.b:0 "Red Dusk, the critical eye of Marksism."
  thestral.999.c:0 "Tranquil Serenade, the spry anti-communist."
