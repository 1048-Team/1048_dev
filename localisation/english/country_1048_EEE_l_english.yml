  ###Decision Categories###
  EEE_tribal_confederation_category:0 "Uniting the Thestrals"
  EEE_tribal_confederation_category_desc:0 "Aside from §C[BAT.GetNameDef]§! there has never been a united thestral nation, as the ratio of thestrals to other ponies is miniscule. When the majority of the thestral populace from Hollow Shades fled §ODaybreaker's§! rule, they settled within the South-East, in §YAyacachtli§! and centralized the Equus thestral population. While thestrals are no less civilized, they have maintained a de facto tribal structure for generations, and our claimed territory is less a country and more a loose conglomeration of villages, towns, and hamlets scattered throughout the jungle.\n\nCurrently, those on the §YMoonspeaker Council§! are seen as the rightful leaders of the thestrals tribes, on a purely honorary basis. In light of the Council's failure to protect against the §RNeighua uprising§!, voices have been raised about fully uniting and putting down our rivals for good. The two loudest advocates for removing the Moonspeakers from power are §RRed Dusk§! and §CTranquil Serenade§!. Red Dusk is popular with the working class, while Tranquil Serenade has made in-roads with the outlying tribes. However, the Council still has influence within Ayacachtli, and §GStellar Note§! has promised to reform them if trust is left in her.\n\nAll possible candidates are currently vying for the most support while lowering the others' standing in the tribes' eyes. When the tribal leaders finally convene, they will decide who will be given the reins of the nation based on who has wooed them hardest."

  ###General Traits###
  bloodlust_general:0 "Esauineminilistli"
  bloodlust_general_desc:0 "While many ponies recognize that thestrals are not bloodthirsty vampires hellbent on consuming the life essence of others, Gushing Pulse would give them pause. Extremely aggressive, to the point of being feral, she is ruthless and uncaring, sending wave after wave of soldiers to die against the enemy to satiate her desire for death. Soldiers do not have a long life expectancy under her command."
  ezmetzli_general:0 "Ezmetzli Orchestra Member"
  ezmetzli_general_desc:0 "A member of the ancient lunar cult of the thestral race, this thestral is a pursuant of night tactics and hitting hard and fast. Compared to the Solaris Adoratio, they eke out every bit of anger and hatred out of their soldiers, in exchange for pure durability of their commands."
  #moon_guardian:0 "Metspixkitl"
  moon_guardian:0 "Watcher of the Night"
  moon_guardian_desc:0 "Nocturne Vision is the grand master of the ancient Custodiens Nocte, which is dedicated to protecting against the threat of the Ezmetzli. With the onset of a greater danger, both the Custodiens and the Ezmetzli have made peace for the time being. However, she at least believes in her soldiers' worth, and it shows in the casualty results compared to Gushing Pulse."
  custodiens_nocte:0 "Custodiens Nocte Knight"
  custodiens_nocte_desc:0 "A member of the ancient lunar salvation cult the Custodiens Nocte. Dedicated to protecting the night and its beauty from the danger of nightmares from the Ezmetzli, they can always get the most information possible from any situation. Their command is sometimes pushed beyond its limits, and soldiers have frequently complained about their harsh punishments to accomplish victory."
  
  ###National Spirits###
  EEE_tribal_holdings:0 "Tribal Holdings"
  EEE_tribal_holdings_desc:0 "Much of our land is already unsuitable for building factories and industrializing, and what is there has already been claimed by the thestral tribes that live here. We can't simply kick them out, as much as we need more factories, and need them soon."
  EEE_tribal_militias:0 "Untrained Militias"
  #EEE_tribal_militias_desc:0 "Now that we have broken free from [STB.GetNameDef], there are many thestrals that wish for us to remain independent and are willing to die for that cause. Many of these warriors lack the proper skills and weapons, and we simply do not have enough personnel to train them."
  EEE_tribal_militias_desc:0 "When the Moonspeakers kept the populace placated and docile, COBSOC eventually permitted us to keep a militia for regional defense. They were instrumental in breaking free from [STB.GetNameDef], but they are not a professional army. Although they have much enthusiasm to see us independent, they are poorly trained and equipped. We simply don't have the personnel or resources to fix that, at this time."
  EEE_tribal_politics:0 "Distrusted Council"
  EEE_tribal_politics_desc:0 "Since the end of the war against the Solar Empire, the Moonspeakers worked with COBSOC to keep an uneasy peace over our land. The independence that we fought for was surrendered in exchange for less bloodshed. This collaboration with another oppressive regime has left thestral society wary of the Moonspeakers and is a trust that cannot be regained easily now that they lead [EEE.GetNameDef]."
  EEE_conflicted_council:0 "Conflicted Council"
  EEE_conflicted_council_desc:0 "When the previous head councilor, Waxing Crescent, died in a tragic accident, it was expected that his daughter, Waning Crescent would be elected due to his and her popularity. Instead, Stellar Note was chosen and has gone on a campaign of removing corruption within the council. This has formed two power blocs, and very little can be done without immense debate."
  #EEE_tribal_politics_desc:0 "There are two main factions in [EEE.GetName], the Metstlis and the Tekitinis, and both have very different views on how the nation should be run. Tranquil Serenade wishes to keep us safe and ready for when [BAL.GetNameDef] eventually comes for us, while Red Dusk desires to unite all thestrals in a workers' paradise. They don't see eye-to-eye at the best of times."
  EEE_night_whispering:0 "Whispering of the Night"
  EEE_night_whispering_desc:0 "These lands are filled with some of the holiest sites of the thestral race, including temples blessed by the Moon Goddess. Whispered rumors of two ancient cults dedicated to different aspects of the Moon Goddess have persisted for generations. But they're just that: rumors. Recent disappearances within and around [30.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] have brought these tales to light again and have left fear in some of our citizens."

  #Olde
  EEE_be_careful_scoob_tt:0 "§RThe coalition is highly unstable. Dropping below 40% stability in times of peace will cause the rifts to fracture and start a civil war. Additionally, while Tranquil Serenade and Red Dusk are tolerant of SOME partisan bills being passed, leaning too heavily toward one side or the other may lead to instability or even conflict.§!"
  EEE_eee_no_longer_tt:0 "§RThe Neighua have slaughtered our militia around Red Glory and sworn to end our "threat to the Sun" permanently.§!"
