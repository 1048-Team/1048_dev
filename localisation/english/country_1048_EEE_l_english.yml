  ###General Traits###
  bloodlust_general:0 "Esauineminilistli"
  bloodlust_general_desc:0 "While many ponies recognize that thestrals are not bloodthirsty vampires hellbent on consuming the life essence of others, Gushing Pulse would give them pause. Extremely aggressive, to the point of being feral, she is ruthless and uncaring, sending wave after wave of soldiers to die against the enemy to satiate her desire for death. Soldiers do not have a long life expectancy under her command."
  ezmetzli_general:0 "Ezmetzli Orchestra Member"
  ezmetzli_general_desc:0 "A member of the ancient lunar cult of the thestral race, this thestral is a pursuant of night tactics and hitting hard and fast. Compared to the Solaris Adoratio, they eke out every bit of anger and hatred out of their soldiers, in exchange for pure durability of their commands."
  moon_guardian:0 "Metspixkitl"
  moon_guardian_desc:0 "Nocturne Vision is the grand master of the ancient Custodiens Nocte, which is dedicated to protecting against the threat of the Ezmetzli. With the onset of a greater danger, both the Custodiens and the Ezmetzli have made peace for the time being. However, she at least believes in her soldiers' worth, and it shows in the casualty results compared to Gushing Pulse."
  custodiens_nocte:0 "Custodiens Nocte Knight"
  custodiens_nocte_desc:0 "A member of the ancient lunar salvation cult the Custodiens Nocte. Dedicated to protecting the night and its beauty from the danger of nightmares from the Ezmetzli, they can always get the most information possible from any situation. Their command is sometimes pushed beyond its limits, and soldiers have frequently complained about their harsh punishments to accomplish victory."
  
  ###National Spirits###
  EEE_tribal_holdings:0 "Tribal Holdings"
  EEE_tribal_holdings_desc:0 "Much of our land is already unsuitable for building factories and industrializing, and what is there has already been claimed by the thestral tribes that live here. We can't simply kick them out, as much as we need more factories, and need them soon."
  EEE_tribal_militias:0 "Untrained Militias"
  EEE_tribal_militias_desc:0 "Now that we have broken free from [NRP.GetNameDef], there are many thestrals that wish for us to remain independent and are willing to die for that cause. Many of these warriors lack the proper skills and weapons, and we just do not have enough personnel to train them."
  EEE_tribal_politics:0 "Political Feuding"
  EEE_tribal_politics_desc:0 "There are two main factions in [EEE.GetName], the Metstlis and the Tekitinis, and both have very different views on how the nation should be run. Tranquil Serenade wishes to keep us safe and ready for when [BAL.GetNameDef] eventually comes for us, while Red Dusk desires to unite all thestrals in a workers' paradise. They don't see eye-to-eye at the best of times."
  EEE_night_whispering:0 "Whispering of the Night"
  EEE_night_whispering_desc:0 "These lands are filled with some of the holiest sites for thestrals, including temples blessed by the Night Goddess. Rumors have always abounded of two secret societies dedicated to this deity, but they've always remained in the shadows. Recent disappearances have brought these tales to light again and have left fear in some of our citizens."
  
  ###Tooltips###
  EEE_be_careful_scoob_tt:0 "§RThe coalition is highly unstable. Dropping below 40% stability in times of peace will cause the rifts to fracture and start a civil war. Additionally, while Tranquil Serenade and Red Dusk are tolerant of SOME partisan bills being passed, leaning too heavily toward one side or the other may lead to instability or even conflict.§!"
