  ###Advisor Traits###

  ###Unit Leader Traits###
  heartless:0 "Heartless"
  heartless_desc:0 "The concept of mercy or forgiveness is foreign to Opaline. An archetypal inquisitor, her ambitions to serve Daybreaker and eradicate any and all heresy have provided her with ample opportunity within Whinnyapolis, with which to further her influence within the Inquisitionis. She will push her troops to the breaking point, and then push harder."
  the_last_soldier:0 "The Last Soldier"
  the_last_soldier_desc:0 "When Solar Strike first arrived in Whinnyapolis, there was much hope of a quick and simple conquest before returning the territory to the Empire. But after four long, arduous years, he has been bogged down by administering a region that is always on the brink of collapse. Even with all his duties, the last true soldier for Daybreaker will serve her to the end, as will his troops."
  the_friendly_heretic:0 "Friendly Heretic"
  the_friendly_heretic_desc:0 "As the head priestess that went with Solar Strike, Horizon Sunrise carries with her a charismatic weight that few can resist. Behind the thin veneer of geniality lies a cunning heretic who is rarely questioned, such is the respect that she has earned from others. Her troops, corrupted from the values of the Solar Empire, still fight for the Empress currently, with even more ferocity than others within the nation."
  
  ###National Spirits###
  WHY_communist_agitators:0 "Commune Agitators"
  WHY_communist_agitators_desc:0 "As former territory of the [NER.GetName], most ponies in Whinnyapolis and the surrounding regions have resisted our rule. Tension in Whinnyapolis is continuing to boil, as clashes with our soldiers and those who wish to see the former commune returned escalate. A permanent solution must be found soon."
  WHY_ephemeral_rule:0 "Ephemeral Rule"
  WHY_ephemeral_rule_desc:0 "Most of the country still refuses to acknowledge the Junta's command, despite our attempts to pacify and integrate them after Marechester was pushed out of the region. With our limited ponypower, there is very little we can do at this time, as we have more important concerns in Whinnyapolis itself."
  WHY_forced_conscription:0 "Excessive Conscription"
  WHY_forced_conscription_desc:0 "As an attempt to offset our tenuous situtation, the Junta has attempted to press as many ponies as possible into service. For the first year or more of our rule, our soldiers mostly went about grabbing every young and able-bodied pony they could find. These militia are green and hate us, but so long as they shoot where told, does it really matter?"
  WHY_imperial_military_junta:0 "Imperial Military Junta"
  WHY_imperial_military_junta_desc:0 "After our conquest of 1044, Solar Strike established a junta to maintain emergency powers over Whinnyapolis and the countryside. The officers in charge don't always see eye to eye, which leads to gridlock on many military and non-military matters."
  WHY_heretic_cult:0 "Heretical Cult"
  WHY_heretic_cult_desc:0 "The archmage that traveled with Solar Strike has established another branch of the Adoratio here. It has quickly gone off the rails and straight into heretical teachings. However, this Solar Reverentia has become popular with its esoteric and mystic interpretations of the Empress, which has sewn further divisions into the populace, as some love it, and others hate it."
