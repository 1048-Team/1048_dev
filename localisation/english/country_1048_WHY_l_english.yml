  ###National Spirits###
  WHY_communist_agitators:0 "Commune Agitators"
  WHY_communist_agitators_desc:0 "As former territory of the [NER.GetName], most ponies in Whinnyapolis and the surrounding regions have resisted our rule. Tension in Whinnyapolis is continuing to boil, as clashes with our soldiers and those who wish to see the former commune returned escalate. A permanent solution must be found soon."
  WHY_ephemeral_rule:0 "Ephemeral Rule"
  WHY_ephemeral_rule_desc:0 "Most of the country still refuses to acknowledge the Junta's command, despite our attempts to pacify and integrate them after Marechester was pushed out of the region. With our limited ponypower, there is very little we can do at this time, as we have more important concerns in Whinnyapolis itself."
  WHY_forced_conscription:0 "Excessive Conscription"
  WHY_forced_conscription_desc:0 "As an attempt to offset our tenuous situtation, the Junta has attempted to press as many ponies as possible into service. For the first year or more of our rule, our soldiers mostly went about grabbing every young and able-bodied pony they could find. These militia are green and hate us, but so long as they shoot where told, does it really matter?"
  WHY_imperial_military_junta:0 "Imperial Military Junta"
  WHY_imperial_military_junta_desc:0 "After our conquest of 1044, Solar Strike established a junta to maintain emergency powers over Whinnyapolis and the countryside. The officers in charge don't always see eye to eye, which leads to gridlock on many military and non-military matters."
  WHY_heretic_cult:0 "Heretical Cult"
  WHY_heretic_cult_desc:0 "The archmage that traveled with Solar Strike has established another branch of the Adoratio here. It has quickly gone off the rails and straight into heretical teachings. However, this Solar Reverentia has become popular with its esoteric and mystic interpretations of the Empress, which has sewn further divisions into the populace, as some love it, and others hate it."
