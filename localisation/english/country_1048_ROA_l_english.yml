 ROA_republican_revanchism_desc:0 "In only a few short years, we carved a swath of stability and safety across South-Eastern Zebrica, but to ease the administrative burden, we split into two sister citizens' republics. The east fell to barbarism and repeated invasions by the Zebrides, but not all is lost. As long as the light of the founding republic stands, we shall reclaim what was lost and be a flame of security and prosperity on the continent."
