 ## Subideologies
 changeling_ideology_desc:0 "Changeling Hegemonism, or Changelingsim, is the ideology that won the Great War, or so the books tell. The Changeling Lands are a disparate and diverse nation, filled with semi-autonomous hives that, when they aren't fighting amongst themselves, work toward a common goal. Changelingism looks to a strong, centralized leader to lead their armies to supremacy. Any queen from a hive can challenge the current supreme queen, leading to a cutthroat, aggressive, and expansionist ideology."
 harmonic_monarchy_desc:0 "Harmonic monarchies are one of the ancient forms of government from the before times. Monarchies are led by a benevolent, immortal alicorn Princess, who guide the nations through peaceful and troubled times alike. They are frequently stable, and their citizens enjoy many freedoms and luxuries. With the rise of radical ideologies such as Solarism or MARESOC, Harmonic Monarchism remains a fading beacon of liberty and love in a world marred by fear, control, and hatred."
 wingbardian_fascism_desc:0 "Wingbardian Fascism, or simply Fascism, is an ultranationalist ideology created by Giulio Beakolini. Under Fascism, the supreme dictator of the country leads all aspects of life, creating strict segmentation of the economy and of social order. Unity of spirit and belief is promoted above all else: the fatherland is superior to all other nations. Compared to other totalitarian ideologies, Fascism still provides minor freedoms to its citizens, as they are otherwise free to keep their thoughts to themselves—a luxury not afforded to those of the rising superpowers."
 solarism_desc:0 "Solarism is the religion of the ancient Solaris Adoratio, dedicated to the veneration, worship, and deification of Princess Celestia. Maligned during Celestia's millennia-long rule, after her corruption and ascension as Daybreaker Sun, the Solaris Adoratio was instated as the official religion and ideology of the Solar Empire. Any thought that does not agree with Daybreaker's is heresy. Heresy is punishable by death. Death by Holy Flame."
 rad_bor_desc:0 "Radical Boreasism, or in the native tongue of the Griffons, Todesanbetung, is the recent radical shift in the religion of Griffonia. Radical Boreasists hold that Grover VI ascended to become the new messenger of Boreas when Griffenheim was decimated by nuclear fire. To one day see and dine with Grover and Boreas, one must only sacrifice their autonomy, becoming an instrument of Grover's will. The remnants of the Archontate rule from Neu-Griffenheim, deciphering the will of Grover and declaring it to the masses. All those who do not faithfully serve their fatherland are corrected, purified through giving their lives in battle with the enemies of Boreas."
 mareland_socialism_desc:0 "MARESOC, or Equish Newspeak for Marelander Socialism, is a form of Markism defined by an oligarchic power structure, creating a strict social caste system. In MARESOC, there are always three distinct classes: the Proles, the Outer Party, and the Inner Party. The Inner Party is given luxuries and freedoms never seen by the overworked Outer Party, and the Proles are ignored, given debaucherous and mindless entertainment to keep them pacified. Any Party members who do not adhere to Big Sister's word are branded criminals who are rehabilitated in the mysterious halls of the Ministry of Love."
 stellarism_desc:0 "Stellarism is akin to Solarism in one way: it worships the immortal goddess of the sun. However, unlike the Solaris Adoratio's solarism, the deity is Solar Flare, the true solar alicorn. Unlike solarism, there is no final purification through fire for the heretic or society. Instead, all ponies are mere tools to serve Solar Flare. Solar Flare is the engine of destruction for a cursed world, and it will be purged through the heat of her sun. Ponies worship her in their death which will feed the fuels of perdition."
 lunarism_desc:0 "Compared to the very vocal religion of the Solaris Adoratio, the secret sect of worshipers of the moon, the Lunar Exaltare are mysterious and rarely seen. Always part of the shadows, the cult praises Luna and Nightmare Moon as the same being, venerating them as shields of the night and of dreams. While outwardly more freedom-loving, many ponies who have criticized the harsh ways of the Exaltare have disappeared without a trace, and little is known what the cult's end goal is, other than seeing the word of Nightmare Moon reach the ends of Equus and beyond."
 ezmetzli_desc:0 "Although sometimes believed to be an offshoot of the Lunarist cult, the Ezmetzli is far older than the time of Luna. Little is known about the true origins of the thestral religion, although rumors abound about worship to a second, more powerful goddess of the night. Public sacrifice is a common occurrence and rite in the cult, with a constant requirement for fresh pony blood needed to keep the Moon Goddess pleased with her servants' work. Under the Ezmetzli, all ponykind suffer, with only the most blessed being preserved from the coming punishment of the world."
 authoritarian_democracy_desc:0 "A perverted variant of a democratic institution, authoritarian democracies are characterized by mildly free citizens who in theory have a constitution to uphold their rights. Through either corruption, willful surrender by the populace, or a benevolent dictator, many of the public institutions become eroded, and power centralizes around one figure. Most elections are merely shams to keep up the appearance of harmony and freedom. Some theorize that this is the last stage of a democratic nation, while others believe it will give birth to an even freer society once relenquished."
 authoritarian_desc:0 "Authoritarianism is the most basic form of dictatorship. A state led by a strong central figure, an authoritarian system gives almost unlimited power to the ruler of the country who then delegates, if they're generous, to additional members of their cabinet to control other parts of the government. With no oversight, corruption is frequently rampant and hinders any productivity to keep the wheels of society going."
