  POLITICS_SUNNY_STARSCOUT_DESC: "§YBorn§!: April 7th, 1023 ALB\n\nA foreigner to the Principality of Central Equestria, Sunny Starscout is the daughter of one of the many heretic families of the Solar Empire. Born in Maritime Bay, she barely had time to learn to speak and walk or make friends and relations with ponies before she and her parents, Argyle Gust and Cheer Blossom were forced to flee at the hooves of the Inquisitionis.\n\nFor weeks they managed to evade Daybreaker's forces, and made their way south to the Principality, one of the last bastions of Harmony on the continent. As they reached the proximity of the borders, they were nearly captured by a Militarium patrol. In the escape, Cheer Blossom was killed before Sunny's eyes, and the foal watched her mother perish in her hooves.\n\nBarely evading the patrol, the two of remaining ponies ultimately ended up in the small town of Bridlewood, along the edge of the Principality's domain. For weeks, Sunny was unable to process the fate of her mother. In the aftermath, Argyle noticed that she began to mumble and hold conversation with herself, although she never showed outward sign of mental trauma.\n\nHowever, Sunny grew into a passionate, seemingly-healthy young mare who believed full-well in the superiority of Harmony and friendship. Along the way, she met and befriended two other natives to the town, Izzy Moonbow and Hitch Trailblazer. Despite it all, she grew to see that ponies were not working enough on friendship and magic, and she grew to protest the slightest perceived faults with the town. Mostly, she was seen as a harmless and slightly unstable activist, as she rarely broke down into rambling rants between herself.\n\nHowever, with she and her friends' assassination of Copper Fetlock, she now is in control of the Principality. As she preaches about safety, harmony, peace, and friendship from the castle, she remains reclusive and obsessed with the former Elements of Harmony. More frequently she has been encountered holding arguments with herself, supposedly with the different Element-bearers and her disagreements with their policies.\n\nDespite her instability, there is one overarching directive in all her decrees: Ponies are to make friends, and their diversity is their strength. Everypony shall be unique and skilled in a craft. For when everypony is special, nopony will be.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Bubblepurity"
  POLITICS_FLEUR_DE_LIS_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: November 1st, 977 ALB\n\n§YBiography§!: An actress from the Prench region of Equestria, Fleur de Lis is a pony that has been talked into far too many things in her life. When she was young, Fleur was nothing more than a simple farm pony who hoped to one day strike it big in the eyes of ponies from across the nation. However, there was little that she knew that could attract talent scouts, as Prance was far more known for its vineyards and music rather than their talent on stage. Content to live on her family's farm for the rest of her life, she was surprised when she traveled into town and encounter a pony who would change her life.\n\nFancy Pants, recent nobestallion of the Equestrian court, was attending a delegation for new wine contracts for the castle when the two bumped into each other. Literally. For both, it was love at first sight as Fancy requested that she give his group a tour of the town. Within a few short months, he started to return to meet with her, eventually offering her a chance to shine in Canterlot, which she took up immediately.\n\nAs Canterlot's newest couple, she received much of the attention that she craved, but Fancy's humble demeanor helped keep her ego in check. For a few short years, everything seemed to be succeeding. She even played a part in a play as Celestia, given her physical similarities to the princess.\n\nHowever, when Daybreaker ascended, she placed much of the aristocracy under arrest after she finished her war with Stalliongrad. As she was out on a photo shoot at the time of Daybreaker's action, she was able to flee with some of the other nobles into the countryside. When the Principality of Central Equestria was declared, she moved with them to its capital of New Canterlot, where she received minor recognition as representative of Fancy Pants.\n\nNow she has taken on the greatest act of her career: fooling everypony to believe that she is Celestia. Despite her protest, the sham has moved forward, and she sits on the throne as the sole princess of Equestria. While it may look obvious to some, nopony has called her out on it yet. For her own sake, she hopes it stays that way.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

So long as they don't mind being watched at all hours of the day."
