 ###Leader Bios###
  POLITICS_SUNNY_STARSCOUT_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 7th of April, 1025 in Maretime Bay\n\nA foreigner to the Principality of Central Equestria, Sunny Starscout is the daughter of one of the many heretic families of the Solar Empire. A native of Maretime Bay, she barely had time to learn to speak and walk or make friends and relations with ponies before she and her parents, Argyle Gust and Cheer Blossom were forced to flee at the hooves of the Inquisitionis.\n\nFor weeks they managed to evade Daybreaker's forces, and made their way south to the Principality, one of the last bastions of Harmony on the continent. As they reached the proximity of the borders, they were nearly captured by a Militarium patrol. In the escape, Cheer Blossom was killed before Sunny's eyes, and the foal watched her mother perish in her hooves.\n\nBarely evading the patrol, the two of remaining ponies ultimately ended up in the small town of Bridlewood, along the edge of the Principality's domain. For weeks, Sunny was unable to process the fate of her mother. In the aftermath, Argyle noticed that she began to mumble and hold conversation with herself, although she never showed outward sign of mental trauma.\n\nHowever, Sunny grew into a passionate, seemingly-healthy young mare who believed full-well in the superiority of Harmony and friendship. Along the way, she met and befriended two other natives to the town, Izzy Moonbow and Hitch Trailblazer. Despite it all, she grew to see that ponies were not working enough on friendship and magic, and she grew to protest the slightest perceived faults with the town. Mostly, she was seen as a harmless and slightly unstable activist, as she rarely broke down into rambling rants between herself.\n\nHowever, with she and her friends' assassination of Copper Fetlock, she now is in control of the Principality. As she preaches about safety, harmony, peace, and friendship from the castle, she remains reclusive and obsessed with the former Elements of Harmony. More frequently she has been encountered holding arguments with herself, supposedly with the different Element-bearers and her disagreements with their policies.\n\nDespite her instability, there is one overarching directive in all her decrees: Ponies are to make friends, and their diversity is their strength. Everypony shall be unique and skilled in a craft. For when everypony is special, nopony will be.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Bubblepurity"
  POLITICS_FLEUR_DE_LIS_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 1st of November, 977 in Horseleans\n\n§YBiography§!: An actress from the Prench region of Equestria, Fleur de Lis is a pony that has been talked into far too many things in her life. When she was young, Fleur was nothing more than a simple farm pony who hoped to one day strike it big in the eyes of ponies from across the nation. However, there was little that she knew that could attract talent scouts, as Prance was far more known for its vineyards and music rather than their talent on stage. Content to live on her family's farm for the rest of her life, she was surprised when she traveled into town and encounter a pony who would change her life.\n\nFancy Pants, recent nobestallion of the Equestrian court, was attending a delegation for new wine contracts for the castle when the two bumped into each other. Literally. For both, it was love at first sight as Fancy requested that she give his group a tour of the town. Within a few short months, he started to return to meet with her, eventually offering her a chance to shine in Canterlot, which she took up immediately.\n\nAs Canterlot's newest couple, she received much of the attention that she craved, but Fancy's humble demeanor helped keep her ego in check. For a few short years, everything seemed to be succeeding. She even played a part in a play as Celestia, given her physical similarities to the princess.\n\nHowever, when Daybreaker ascended, she placed much of the aristocracy under arrest after she finished her war with Stalliongrad. As she was out on a photo shoot at the time of Daybreaker's action, she was able to flee with some of the other nobles into the countryside. When the Principality of Central Equestria was declared, she moved with them to its capital of New Canterlot, where she received minor recognition as representative of Fancy Pants.\n\nNow she has taken on the greatest act of her career: fooling everypony to believe that she is Celestia. Despite her protest, the sham has moved forward, and she sits on the throne as the sole princess of Equestria. While it may look obvious to some, nopony has called her out on it yet. For her own sake, she hopes it stays that way.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
  coloratura_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 7th of October, 985 near Fillydelphia\n\nColoratura was born in a small town outside of Fillydelphia, where she spent much of her early years listening to the great artists and performers from both the industrial city and the city of lights, Manehattan. Not one single musician influenced her style, as she took from a young age to the stage. When she was a filly, she went to an Equestrian Scout camp and befriended one of the Elements of Harmony, Applejack. Later on, she performed one of her most heartfelt songs, Equestria, the Land I Love, which earned her some interest from local recording studios, where she became a regional hit in Fillydelphia.\n\nWhen she went to Manehattan to further her musical prospects, she was barely noticed by many of the larger labels, as her personal style was seen as rustic, backward, or too simple for many of the ponies of the day. Through desperation, she signed a deal with Svengallop from Pony Music Studios, which rewrote her persona into a "royal" of pop and early dance music. Throughout the Great War, she performed at various venues to keep morale up, frequently going out of her way to add a bit of personal flair to the orchestrated nights. Eventually she would return to her roots when Svengallop revealed his hatred for the soldiers and their "silly war".\n\nLike many other ponies from Canterlot and the southern reaches of the Solar Empire, she fled to the territories that would eventually make up the Central Principality of Equestria, where she later found herself looked to for support, due to her celebrity nature. In time, this duty transformed into a proper minister of propaganda for the reigning regency. At times she has butted heads with Diamond Tiara and others on the regency council, but frequently, providing white lies is the best way to keep ponies happy and safe. Some days, though, she cannot avoid asking if Applejack would approve of her friend "Rara" abusing so many.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Darksly-z"

  CER_equestrias_breadbasket:0 "Equestria's Breadbasket"
  CER_equestrias_breadbasket_desc:0 "The central plains of Equestria have always yielded abundant crops to feed the rest of the country. The earth ponies that live here take pride in their work, but the massive tracts of farmland make it more difficult for industry to take hold."
  CER_lacking_urbanization:0 "Little Urbanization"
  CER_lacking_urbanization_desc:0 "There are only a few scattered cities in the [CER.GetName], and compared to the Solar Empire or the [BLS.GetName] they are fairly small. This has hindered proper development of city centers, and leaves the nation further behind than most of its fellow splinter states."
  CER_infinite_regency:0 "Endless Regency"
  CER_infinite_regency_desc:0 "Since Regal declared that there would be a regency council to find a successor to Celestia, the country has been run by an oligarchy of nobles and other elites. Corruption has set in and reared itself by adding red tape upon red tape to any and all decisions."
  CER_legitimacy_crisis:0 "Legitimacy Crisis"
  CER_legitimacy_crisis_desc:0 "The lower classes have lost almost complete faith in the regency council and [CER.GetLeader] and have turned to alternate factions that claim to listen to them. Both the HSL and the HCU have their own plans for the Principality, and they do not get along on the best of days, let alone the worst."

  easily_startled:0 "Easily Startled"
  easily_startled_desc:0 "Always on edge, potentially because of the consistent stream of sugary confections that she eats, Sugar Moonlight is incredibly twitchy. However, her accomplishments due to this constant fear of being attacked by \"those Solarists\" means that she is frequently able to have her troops ready for war at a moment's notice. So long as they don't mind being watched at all hours of the day."
  moonatic:0 "Over the Moon"
  moonatic_desc:0 "Nopony exactly gets how Izzy does what she does. Squeezing more ponies into the same space, finding the right gift or surprise for her troops just when one needs an uplifting thing, or figuring out the most gruesome way possible to fight back against the Solarists, frequently with explosive candy or other treats. Whatever she is, she's a force of nature that will forever be a mystery."
  unconfident_wallflower:0 "Unconfident Wallflower"
  unconfident_wallflower_desc:0 "A relatively young pony, Misty has yet to receive much formal training for serving in the Principality, but she has much enthusiasm to help protect her home and to assist other ponies. Given her skittish nature and her general lack of experience, many of the older troops under her consider her "cute" and "adorable," especially when flustered, which makes it difficult to have orders taken seriously."
