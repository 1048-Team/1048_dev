  YMN_righteous_war:0 "The Sun War"
  YMN_righteous_war_desc:0 "The infidels in [ABY.GetNameDef] have oppressed us and beaten us down for our resources for years, hampering our efforts to worship the winds of sand. We have worn their shackles for too long, since the last Emir of Yemane surrendered without a fight to the corrupt armies of [ABY.GetLeader]! We have the blessing of the Sands of Fate itself, and there shall be no stopping us from ridding the infidel from our lands and retaking what is rightfully ours!"
  YMN_desert_calling:0 "Desert Calling"
  YMN_desert_calling_desc:0 "The heat of the desert are overbearing to some, and the sands that blow in them degrading, but we know different. There are spirits and guardians within the deepest deserts of Zebrica, who we have seen with our very eyes, and that we will share with the rest of the world. Heat has no meaning to us, and we will fight to the last to have everycreature follow them!"
