 ###Descrptions###
  POLITICS_VAPOR_TRAIL_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!§L: 28th of April, 985 ALB in Stratusburg§!\n\n§YBio§!§L: From a young age, Vapor Trail always dreamed of being one of the great Wonderbolts of her time, to have her image in the hall of fame in Cloudsdale's great aviation history museums. As an only foal, her innate skill with flight were heavily encouraged and developed by her parents, who pushed her to her limits to have the best chance of getting into the Wonderbolts Academy when she came of age. However, her parents' affections grew stifling, and to vent some of her frustrations, she befriended the impulsive Sky Stinger, the two of them becoming inseparable, even when in Wonderbolts training.\n\nAfter revealing her own overbearing assistance to her friend, with the help of Rainbow Dash and Princess Twilight Sparkle, she honed the last of her abilities, and gave Sky Stinger the true guidance and help that he needed. Both passed, and went on to serve in the Great War to keep skies clear of changeling attack wings. Eventually, when the Wonderbolts became a fighter wing instead of pegasi fighting in hoof-to-hoof, she became one of the earliest aces in the Equestrian air force.\n\nBeloved for her optimistic and encouraging demeanor, her wing mates constantly sang her praises, which eventually led to her being recalled to Canterlot to train new pilots as the Great War worsened, and the need for effective fighting forces in the air became apparent. During Daybreaker's ascension, she helped to lead some of the harmonist nobility out of the city toward the Crystal Empire, before leading her squadron of wing mates back to Stratusburg, where she met with Sky Stinger to run multiple missions against the nascent Solar Empire and against Stalliongrad's new puppet government.\n\nWhen the Cloudsdale Autonomy was declared, and as the noose was beginning to close on their ragtag group, Vapor and Sky daringly flew across the Empire, utilizing a couple of known rebel groups to refuel, and reunite with their fellow Wonderbolts.\n\nThroughout her career, Vapor has always remained a sunny side up pony, which in the dark hours of the Solar Empire's collapse and Daybreaker's iron hoof is much needed. Some days are harder than others, but as she always says, with her wing mates and friends by her side, she will always have hope in her heart.§!\n\n§YPortrait by§!§L: ChoiAila§!"
