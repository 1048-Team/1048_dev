  ###Leader Descriptions###
  POLITICS_DAYBREAKER_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: At least 2000 BLB\n\n§YBiography§!: For eons, the land of Equestria was protected by two sister alicorns to rule over the day and night. Their serene guidance helped establish strong ties between ponies, forming harmony that lasted for generations to come. Little is known where the sisters, Celestia and Luna, originated from. In their early rule, many venerated them as gods before they were kindly corrected.\n\nThe harmony of Equestria would not last, however, as the Great War of 1011 would shatter the idyllic outlook of her ponies. Out of this chaos, Daybreaker would emerge. She answered the call, overpowering what sanity Celestia had left to provide the final solution to her problems: unending, overwhelming firepower.\n\nDaybreaker is everything Celestia was not: pompous, arrogant, self-centered, aggressive. Her ponies are merely tools to her, the Solaris Adoratio (Solar Cult), the outlet to keep their fears at bay. Despite the decades since the collapse of the great Solar Empire, many still worship at her hooves, and Imperial society is one of endless adoration and sacrifice. Daybreaker cares little beyond one day reclaiming her rightful place as ruler, not just of the lands of Equestria, but one day the world. All will worship the sun, and Daybreaker will be the herald of their salvation.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: RyanBoi"
  POLITICS_CELESTIA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: At least 2000 BLB\n\n§YBiography§!: Long before the chaos of modern times, the land of Equestria was ruled by two sisters. One controlled the day; another controlled the night. Together, they led their ponies into an era of prosperity, peace, and happiness. These sisters, Celestia and Luna, were alicorns: powerful beings that bore the magical properties of all three species of pony. For centuries they ruled, but it would not last.\n\nLuna fell to the darkness, and Celestia was forced to seal her away in the moon, lest she destroy the world through her hubris. As Celestia was close to her sister, she grew distant and cold, plunging Equestria into a short time of intense heat. Strict laws were enacted, and her ponies chafed. At the peak of this, she reflected and saw herself repeating Luna's mistakes, and she stepped back from the precipice. This would continue for a thousand years, until Luna returned.\n\nIn the aftermath, the world experienced rapid development. Celestia believed that, with her reformed sister, they could weather the tides and live peaceful coexistence. This error in judgement cost her everything: her ponies, her country, her very self.\n\nFor forty years, she watched her alter ego, Daybreaker bring suffering to what was left of the nation of Equestria. Now that she is finally returned, she is wiser.\n\nAlthough she is much more merciful and serene than Daybreaker, her experiences have hardened Celestia's resolve. Now far more pragmatic, her kindest tendencies have faded to give way to a desire to see her wayward ponies protected from all that would threaten them. Her beloved nation, Equestria, will one day be restored, and her serene guidance will lead it into another golden era.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: RyanBoi"
  POLITICS_AURORA_SHINESPARK_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: September 6th, 1021 ALB\n\n§YBiography§!: One of the youngest ponies to achieve the rank of Archmage in the Solaris Inquisitionis, Aurora Shinespark grew up staunchly in the hardest portions of the Solar Empire. Raised in Manehattan, she experienced the first union riot of 1032, where she earned her cutie mark in infernal magic defending a pair of citizens from rogue workers.\n\nWhen she reached the appropriate age, she attended former Princess Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns, now Daybreaker's College for Talented Mages. Successfully reaching the rank of Mage, she was given a position as lieutenant of the former Archmage of her home city, Nebula Flare. However, Nebula Flare was declared a heretic, and fled the country, placing the fairly green Aurora in charge of the chapter.\n\nUnder her leadership, she held the peace in Manehattan, although little was done to resolve the unrest. While she can have a hoofs-off methodology, when pushed she will retaliate with appropriate force. As a loyal inquisitor, she ensures that ponies are kept in line.\n\nNow the Princess Regent, Aurora leads the nation with stern justice. Little of the entrenchment of the Adoratio and Inquisitionis in government has been addressed. Primarily, her goals are reconquest of the nation, ensuring that the position she was entrusted in follows Daybreaker's vision. The Empress' memory will be honored, and she will be venerated as the immortal, unstoppable being she is.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
  POLITICS_SUNSET_SHIMMER_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: March 23rd, 980 ALB\n\n§YBiography§!: Once the friendship student of Celestia, Sunset Shimmer grew jealous of other ponies and their rapid advancement through Celestia's school. She was not a stupid student, in fact she was a genius, but she considered friends and spending time with them beneath her. In 999 ALB, she broke into the forbidden library of the Canterlot Palace and found her escape. She would run to another world, return with its inhabitants, and conquer Equestria, setting herself up as its new ruler.\n\nThat did not go according to plan, and she was stopped by Celestia's following student, Twilight Sparkle. Although offered a place to return to, she insisted on residing with her new friends in this new world. The honeymoon period was short, and soon Sunset began to grow irritated with many of her friends' quirks.\n\nAlthough she remained connected with them, she let them drift apart, and when Daybreaker summoned her, she answered the call. Daybreaker trained her, forging her into the first leader of the revitalized Solaris Adoratio. Replacing Padlock Key, Sunset rebuilt the order from the ground up, making it the paramilitary arm of Daybreaker's control. All aspects of public life were dictated by the priestesses and battlemages of the order.\n\nBut, she was not satisfied. The Adoratio proclaimed to be family yet did not act like it. Change was still needed, and with Daybreaker's incapacitation, she has that chance. Solar society is still strict, but it is fair. Ponies have the freedom to worship Daybreaker as they wish, and already the spark of unity in the nation is resurging. For however long she lives, Sunset will ensure the memory of both her mentors lives on, forever engrained in the culture.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
  POLITICS_BLUEBLOOD_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: June 5th, 978 ALB\n\nBorn to some minor nobles in Canterlot, Blueblood was originally set for a life of middling success, petitioning for new laws or other bureaucratic monotony. However, after his parents' untimely demise, something he claimed he had no part in, the former Princess Celestia adopted him and treated him as her nephew. Overnight, Blueblood was catapulted into the lap of luxury, something which has stuck with him ever since.\n\nLike his counterpart, Sunset Shimmer, he was raised to learn the ways of friendship and harmony. Usually he managed to at least appear more competent in it, which he would lord over Sunset until she disappeared. After she vanished, little motivated him to continue his studies, and he devoted more time to dabbling in war and military theory than anything else.\n\nAs tensions with the changelings grew, Celestia knew that having somepony with knowledge on war would be imperative, and he was promoted to field marshal in 1010. Troops under his command soon complained of the pedantic nature of his requests, as he usually squandered supplies meant for the front lines.\n\nHowever, he was kept, and after Daybreaker's ascension, was given the title of Lord Commander of the Solaris Militarium, giving him near total control over the general army of the Solar Empire. Daybreaker still could pull rank over him, and this caused both to butt heads on numerous occasions. Now, with his successful coup, nopony can challenge his power.\n\nFrom his new position as Supplicant of the Empress, he has slowly started to reshape Imperial society. Despite being fat and lazy, his arrogance drives his one remaining passion: bending the citizenry to kneel before him. He, like the Empress before him, deserves total adoration, and all of the Empire will acknowledge him as Daybreaker's rightful successor.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
  POLITICS_DYX_DESC:0 "\"What? You want to know when I was popped out of her? I don't know, why do I have to be the damn chronicler?\n\n \"Yeah, the name's Dyx, and you probably know me as that bitch who is Daybreaker's kid. Guess what? That ain't an exaggeration. Do you think I just dyed my mane to look like little Empress Mommy over there? Please! I'd rather make it hot pink. Oh! Or blood red. Yeah! That'd be cool! Gotta find a way to do that...\n\n\"You want to know MORE about me? Jeez, why you gotta be so curious? I like dogs, long walks on the beaches, and a big serving of it's none of your Mommy-damned business, that's what. You want to know how I'll do in a fight? Sure, give me a gun, some cigs, maybe a bit of bubblegum, and we can kick some flank. How's that sound?\n\n\"Now get out of my face! You're cramping my style.\n\n\"Oh yeah, this beautiful mug was captured by §Y2hrnap§!. Weird name, but whatever. They got my good side.\""
  
  ###Unit Leaders###
  swift_waifu_desc:0 "§gBorn in Severyana, 967, Swift Wing was raised among her three older brothers. They were often two trots away from poverty, and thus it was no surprise that when their father enlisted for the Equestrian Guard, he took his children with him to Canterlot. Swift Wing received advanced education in one of Canterlot's private school. Once she became eligible for enlistment, she joined a different unit than her father's. Swift Wing's constitution ensured she passed the most rigorous exercises, towering over most of the stallions. When Severyana rose up in rebellion, she did not side with her homeland, stressing that loyalty to Equestria comes first and foremost. Afterward during the first Changeling invasion in 1002, Swift Wing was blinded in her right eye when a stray grenade detonated too close. She continued to serve in the Royal Engineer Corps regardless in a supporting role. Her tenacity in the face of injuries and setbacks inspires the soldiers under her command.§!""

Starlight Glimmer and Trixie Lulamoon are chiefest among them, and have organized resistance cells for decades. The Empress has tolerated them long enough! The Inquisitionis will scour the Empire in search of their location, beginning with weaklings in the Solaris Militarium."

  EQS_heretics_not_apply:0 "Heretics Need Not Apply"
  EQS_heretics_not_apply_desc:0 "While it is impossible to prevent heretics from slipping into the working population, implementing tighter controls and tests for loyalty and faith in the Empress will root out previously undetected threats.

  EQS_imperial_committee:0 "The Imperial Committee on Civilian Resources"
  EQS_imperial_committee_desc:0 "Many advancements in magitech have been hoarded away by independent inventors over the years.

  EQS_reforming_imperial_infrastructure:0 "Reforming the Imperial Infrastructure"
  EQS_reforming_imperial_infrastructure_desc:0 "Much of the underlying roads and supply lines of the Solar Empire have not been improved since before the Great War.

  EQS_bit_reevaluation:0 "Reevaluating the Imperial Bit"
  EQS_bit_reevaluation_desc:0 "At the time of Daybreaker's ascension, the Equestrian Bit was the literal gold standard of the continental economy. With the subsequent losses of territory after the peace with the changelings, much of that trust was lost; a single bit then could purchase food worth fifty bits today. Rebasing or retiring the bit is paramount, although what shall replace it remains unseen."
  
  EQS_new_imperial_standard:0 "A New Imperial Standard"
  EQS_new_imperial_standard_desc:0 "After much deliberation, the Imperial Bit will be retired and replaced with the Imperial Credit. While still nominally tied to the amount of gold in the Empire's coffers, these will only be issued on paper, and will allow for tighter control of the money supply.

  EQS_dross_purged_desc:0 "With the reforms to the economy, the Solar Empire's outlook has been improving at a steady rate. Employment has shot through the roof, ponies are investing their new hard-earned credits into the few luxuries available and allowed to them, and revenues have increased across the board.

  EQS_burning_path_through_countryside:0 "Burning Through the Countryside"
  EQS_burning_path_through_countryside_desc:0 "The main rail line between Sanctum Solar and Manehattan has seen better days. Like much of the Imperial infrastructure, it has its roots in Equestria, and has not seen much updating since then. Demolishing the old lines and creating new ones are the only way to see improved throughput in travel and supply. Some of the farmers didn't need their land, anyway."
  
  EQS_integral_industry:0 "Integral Imperial Industry"
  EQS_integral_industry_desc:0 "As much as the Empire relies heavily on its military power and industry, it is the simple pony who works at the factory, or the meagre construction worker who builds the roads that deserve the true recognition. To that end, new subsidies will be established to stimulate further development in the civilian economy, for it will keep the Empire strong."

  EQS_all_empress_knowledge_desc:0 "For the the benefit of the economy, a new board dedicated to proper Imperial thought will be created.

  EQS_in_many_numbers_desc:0 "As much as the Empress does know everything, sometimes the additional experience of other ponies is required.

  EQS_empress_knows_best:0 "Only the Empress Knows Best"
  EQS_empress_knows_best_desc:0 "To suggest that anypony other than the God-Empress would know what is the most profitable ventures would be absurd.

  EQS_regional_directors_desc:0 "By keeping the basic parts of the Imperial economy decentralized through officers tasked with keeping tally of specific production requirements, the board can focus on avenues that can improve the overall efficiency of production.

  EQS_empress_economy_desc:0 "Without her, there is no Solar Empire. Withou her, there is no reason to create the necessary tools to protect ponykind. Giving more power to the position of the Empress over the control of the economy will allow Daybreaker to manage every aspect that she needs to when she needs to.

  EQS_worker_priority:0 "Priority for the Workers"
  EQS_worker_priority_desc:0 "Allowing a few extra factories to focus on some of the minor wants of the blue collar workers will keep them from focusing on their greed and instead on the tasks at hoof.

  EQS_solaris_priority:0 "All for the Militarium!"
  EQS_solaris_priority_desc:0 "As the primary barrier against threats of communists, changelings, and chaotic heretics, the Solaris Militarium must be chosen above all other secular pursuits.

This should be encouraged through additional blessings from Daybreaker."
  
  EQS_forge_a_new_reality:0 "Take Charge of the Future"
  EQS_forge_a_new_reality_desc:0 "Because of the younger generation's excitement for learning, that has passed onto their parents, a number of whom have taken courses in their spare time to improve their ability to serve in factories or other industrial positions. These smarter workers have caused a decrease in accidents, and have let the Empire function at a much higher level than before."

  EQS_guided_by_the_celestial_throne_desc:0 "As Princess Regent, Sunst is the only pony who has direct access to the Empress and communication with her. With her exposure to the Goddess, she has become radiant with Daybreaker's wisdom and glory. Like our Empress, her words are law. She will protect us in our hour of need."
  
  EQS_end_the_squabbling:0 "End the Squabbling"
  EQS_end_the_squabbling_desc:0 "Before Sunset departed through the mirror portal, she and Blueblood never got along. Ever since her return, the relationship has worsened. For the Empire to survive, they must operate on the same level, even if they still don't see eye-to-eye. Sunset has proposed a meeting to finally bury the hatchet, and hopefully the Lord Commander accepts."

  EQS_blood_spilled_is_blood_wasted_desc:0 "We want everypony to go to war, but we do not want them dead. Better to die one battle later than one should, to protect the Empress and the Empire even longer. We must get our medicine spells up to scratch. They only need to be effective, not painless. It won't hurt that much, anyway."
  
  EQS_learn_from_the_mistakes_of_the_past:0 "Learn from Past Mistakes"
  EQS_learn_from_the_mistakes_of_the_past_desc:0 "There have been many battles in the history of the Empire. Many of them victories, but more of them defeats. The South-east Secession, the War of the Kingdoms, the Stalliongrad Patriotic War. So many of them were disastrous, and were because we stuck to what was comfortable instead of what was innovate. That changes today, as we analyze what worked and what needs to be discarded."

  EQS_envoys_to_the_lost_desc:0 "While they hate us, the rump states surrounding the Solar Empire all had reasons for seceeding. While Daybreaker has been threatening to conquer them for years, Sunset wants to take a different approach. Perhaps they will listen to a kinder proposition?"
  
  EQS_approach_the_directorate:0 "Approach the Directorate"
  EQS_approach_the_directorate_desc:0 "Bales has always been the greatest irritant to the Solar Empire, at least while Daybreaker remained on the throne. Now with Sunset being somewhat more amicable to science and religion co-existing, there is a chance that Bales will see reason. Presuming, of course, she and Aurora's little trip didn't worsen relations further."

  EQS_commune_with_the_slothful_desc:0 "Arranging a diplomatic mission to just one of the communes in Marechester is difficult enough, but getting all the separate leaders to meet at one time was truly a pain.

  EQS_parlay_with_soarin_desc:0 "[CLD.GetNameDef]'s supreme leader, [CLD.GetLeader] is the only pony we need worry about when we send our diplomatic mission.

  EQS_correct_the_wayward_legions_desc:0 "Scores of ponies live in the [BLS.GetName] and in Whinnyapolis's lands, and they have been misled by both the scientist and the heretic alike.

  EQS_restoring_the_crown_of_the_heartlands_desc:0 "[CER.GetNameDef] controlled one of the agriculturally richest regions in Equestria.

  EQS_inspiration_from_the_inquisitionis_desc:0 "There is much under-utilized land that could be cleared for construction and expansion. Under the different rump states, these areas have been neglected, but now with many prisoners of war from the reunification battles, Quasar Pulse has proposed a simple, and effective option.

  EQS_the_gravest_of_errors_the_greatest_of_comebacks_desc:0 "Despite the uncertainty of the last couple of years, and the lack of guidance from the God-Empress, the Empire has achieved a golden era.

  EQS_blessing_the_flora:0 "Bless the Flora"
  EQS_blessing_the_flora_desc:0 "Much of the South-east, despite its high population, remains uncultivated and undeveloped.

  EQS_tame_the_southern_sun:0 "Southern Sun"
  EQS_tame_the_southern_sun_desc:0 "Although it is already warm in the Solar Empire's core lands, the South-east is another beast to tame. Some of the jungles reach scorching temperatures, and could be the perfect training grounds for our troops in preparation for war against the changelings. The coastlines will provide ample vacation opportunities, too."
  
  EQS_a_batty_matter:0 "A Batty Matter"
  EQS_a_batty_matter_desc:0 "Thestrals. The name strikes fear into most of the population of the Empire.

  EQS_a_creature_of_darkness_desc:0 "Thestrals! Possessed by the black night itself! Their refusal was unfortunate but not surprising.

  EQS_mingle_the_economies_again_desc:0 "Thankfully, the negotiations have begun, and one of the priorities covered is how exactly the two empires will handle trade between their lands. Before the Great War and Cadance's betrayal, our economies were tied closely. We could start that again, especially since it appears the Crystal Empire is still struggling to right itself."

  EQS_the_lesser_of_the_two_evils_desc:0 "An imperative of this trip is for Sunset to depict herself as the saner, rational option compared to war. She is not Daybreaker, and while perhaps they would not describe life as nice, the princesses would be mistaken to claim it as unfair under Sunset's hoof. It is only a matter if that is enough."
  
  EQS_no_longer_the_raging_she_demon:0 "Not the Raging She-Demon"
  EQS_no_longer_the_raging_she_demon_desc:0 "When Sunset last saw Twilight, it was for assistance with a group of girls in the human world who utilized Equestrian magic to turn everypony against each other. As she has been unable to speak with her privately, Sunset is now returning to the Empire, the intent to show Twilight she is the same pony as before broken, unless a miracle happens."

  EQS_its_called_aggressive_negotiations_desc:0 "While the Solar Empire could easily swat the [CRY.GetName] aside like a gnat, it would waste time and resources that could be better spent toward future wars with [CHN.GetName] or [STG.GetName].

  EQS_sanction_the_crystal_economy_desc:0 "After taking Whinnyapolis's territory, some of the convoys between it and the [CRY.GetName] ceased, but not everything. Those particularly brave continued to evade our notice, and we let it slide for a small amount of extra revenue.

  EQS_meet_in_the_glory_of_the_goddess_desc:0 "After all the blustering, it is time for Sunset to depart to meet with [CRY.GetLeader] and the other princesses.

  EQS_dealing_with_the_devil_desc:0 "After all the negotiations and posturing, it is now finally time to finalize the treaty that could see this decades' long squabble finally end. While it has been an insult to the Empire that Cadance was never held accountable for her betrayal, it is better to end this distrust forever, and focus on more important, Equestrian matters."

  EQS_in_the_empress_name_griffonia_shall_be_freed_desc:0 "[EQC.GetName] has been a blight on the world since they rebelled against Equestria in 1008.

  EQS_battering_the_remaining_separation_desc:0 "For the better part of the Empire's existence, the government and the Solaris Adoratio have remained separate entities underneath the Empress.

  EQS_reassess_the_current_balance_of_powers_desc:0 "One of the massive impedances that has kept the Empire from advancing and regaining its might have been the old political structures that have remained since the Great War.

  EQS_slashing_the_bureaucratic_nonsense_desc:0 "In the last forty years, more red tape and governmental roadblocks have been erected than probably the entirety of Equestria's past existence! There are laws dictating how much mane can be trimmed in a single salon visit, or how much waste can be produced by one plumbing system!

  EQS_make_the_fat_work_for_their_position_desc:0 "Many of the nobles who still live in the Imperial Palace are descendants of aristocrats, who themselves were descended from other bluebloods.

  EQS_institute_a_proper_imperial_tithe_desc:0 "Various Ordos have instituted their own tithes to return to Sanctum Solar and Ordo Solus.

  EQS_inquisitorial_inspection_teams_desc:0 "To ensure that workers in the factories continue to serve with all faithfulness, and that unions are repressed wherever murmurings start, a small section of the entire Solaris Cultus shall be dedicated to keeping order in the production lines.

  EQS_construct_new_tax_houses:0 "Construct New Tax Houses"
  EQS_construct_new_tax_houses_desc:0 "As our government becomes more centralized, we will need to have easy access to extracting more money from the population. At the moment, taxation is seen as more of a nuisance than anything else, and the total number of tax collectors reflect that. Expanding the network of collection agencies will provide more efficient coverage, and feed our growing Empire."

  EQS_with_faithfulness_comes_victory_desc:0 "With the realm stabilizing, it is time that we show our citizens what it means to be a servant of the Empress.

  EQS_form_the_solaris_administratum_desc:0 "As a next step in integrating the Solaris Cultus into the Empire, some of the Adoratio will be placed into bureaucratic positions, and will arbiter new laws and their enforcement.

  EQS_relocate_more_of_the_rural_population_desc:0 "While many ponies now live in the cities of the Empire, there are significant portions that reside in small towns and villages.

  EQS_formulate_new_battle_plans_desc:0 "Even the Militarium will be asborbed into the centralized government structure.

  EQS_keep_the_status_quo:0 "Keep the Status Quo"
  EQS_keep_the_status_quo_desc:0 "Since its inception, Equestria has had a fairly decentralized network of states and provinces that functioned mostly on their own. They received assistance from the crown when needed, but otherwise paid their taxes and called it a day. It worked, and it was efficient. The Empress saw wisdom in this, therefore, there is no reason to alter it."
  
  EQS_inquisitorial_oversight:0 "Inquisitorial Oversight"
  EQS_inquisitorial_oversight_desc:0 "That is not to say, however, that the regional governments will be freely allowed to performn whatever they wish.

  EQS_enshrine_the_red_tape:0 "Red Tape Enshrined"
  EQS_enshrine_the_red_tape_desc:0 "There are many ad hoc laws that were sometimes followed and other times not, depending on the situation. Rules governing hat height, nut width, or other minor details were selectively enforced, but now must be codified to keep the political machine well-oiled. This will, however, cause serious delays in many future laws."

  EQS_without_sacrifice_there_is_no_forgiveness_desc:0 "During the crisis with Daybreaker, many citizens felt that they were abandoned by the Empress and subsequently began to fight for themselves, not for the survival of the Empire. This will not do, as the Solar Empire relies on everypony denying themselves and protecting the Empress, and it is high time they remembered that."
  
  EQS_reinforce_the_social_strata:0 "Reinforce the Social Strata"
  EQS_reinforce_the_social_strata_desc:0 "A soft caste system has slowly developed in the Solar Empire over the decades.

These extra parts come at the cost of some reliability, but it's a small price to pay for victory."
  
  EQS_push_the_limit_of_speed:0 "Push the Limit"
  EQS_push_the_limit_of_speed_desc:0 "By overcharging the matrices used in our fighters, we can drive them toward speeds unheard of by conventional propeller planes. Some have even approached the sound barrier, although it soon broke up in the flight tests before it could reach it.

  EQS_the_pride_of_celestia_desc:0 "During the Great War, it was hoped that the Equestrian Airforce could achieve its own greatness, set apart from the Wonderbolts and the tales they cultured over the centuries. It was never achieved, but now we have a chance to bring that intention back. Celestia has already earmarked funds for a program for the best and brightest pilots who will become her new elite force.

  EQS_return_to_the_bit_standard_desc:0 "As the Solar Empire at times was strapped for resources like gold and other precious metals, much of the new currency were simply notes or other promisary objects that held little intrinsic value. To seal the last reforms we must return our entire money supply to the Equestrian Bit. It will lead to a small contraction, but everypony will be left better off in the end."

  EQS_an_old_sun_desc:0 "Much of the personal treasury of Daybreaker was used by Celestia to fund her forces. Now those debts have come due, and there is little that we can do to prevent the nation from collapsing in bankruptcy.

However, it served the military and civilian interest groups to line the oligarchs' pockets instead of the citizens.

  solar.1.t:0 "Thy Will be Done"
  solar.1.d:0 "Light poured through the simple windows of the room. It was small, square, and sparsely decorated. A basic cot was on one corner, and a small wardrobe filled with cloaks and robes was open. In the center of the room, facing into the sunlight and muttering under her breath, a small white unicorn basked in the warmth of Daybreaker's sun.\n\n"Oh Goddess, hallowed be thy Sun," she began praying aloud. To her, the sunshine coming in the from window wasn't just signifying a new day: it was Harmony and Order itself, cleansing her mind of any impure thoughts and healing her body of any harm caused by the darkness of Night.\n\nShe spread herself out on the floor, prostrate toward the window. "As your Sun purifies the world with its light, so too, let it purify our actions. Forgive us our daily sins and lead us not into heresy. Protect us from the forces of Chaos and Disorder, and strengthen our resolve against the heretic. May the fires of your wrath bring swift destruction to your foes. Give us this day the victory against the enemy!"\n\nSlowly, the unicorn got to her hooves, muttering under her breath, "Thy Empire come, thy will be done, on Equus as it is in Sanctum Solar. Amen."\n\nAurora Shinespark gathered herself and thanked the God-Empress for another day in the Empire. Turning around, she reached out with her orange magic to take her inquisitor's cloak. She fastened the dark red and orange cloak to her back, and she brushed down her dark orange and brown mane.\n\n "Sol Invicta, archmage!" one of the inquisitors cried as she left her room. Aurora returned the greeting and sat down. The rest followed suit.\n\nDuring breakfast, they poured over various letters and documents that had been scattered across the table. Manehattan was a special case in the Empire. As it was the primary production base, the citizens were allowed slightly more freedoms than other cities. The Manehatten chapter was tasked with maintaining Harmony and Order in the city, especially against communist infiltration.\n\n"There is a rally today in Slavation Plaza protesting conditions in the uniform factories," a creamy unicorn with tan spots stated.\n\n "Very well," Aurora answered after taking a bite of food. "Fidelis Flamma and Novus Flux! Attend the protest and ensure that no heretics provoke a riot." She turned back to the first pony. "Is there any news on the potential Harmonist terrorist cell?"\n\n"No, archmage," the inquisitor replied. "The Speculatores have returned no new information. The corruption grows deeper, but they are unable to find the source."\n\n"Worrisome," Aurora murmured. Before she could continue, the door to the chapter house opened and a messenger arrived, out of breath from a long travel. "Speak," she barked.\n\n"Aurora Shinespark," he began, gathering as much pomp as he could muster. "You have been summoned to Sanctum Solar. The Empress wishes to speak with you concerning grave matters. You will depart for the holy city at once.""
  solar.1.a:0 "What does the Empress require of me?"
  solar.2.t:0 "Heresy Abounds"
  solar.2.d:0 ""What does the Empress require of me?" Aurora pondered as she approached the entrance to Daybreaker's throne room. Guards of the Solaris Militarium roved the halls, their hooves clanking on the exposed stonework.\n\nFlanking her on either side were a pair of inquisitors, their harsh glares making her feel like she was on trial for heresy. As they creaked open the massive bolted doors, they announced her presence. Waves of heat hit her, instantly causing her to break out into a sweat.\n\nAt the far end of the room, easily a hundred feet distant, the God-Empress sat on her throne, unmoving and watching Aurora with brown and yellow cat-like eyes. She looked to the two guards stationed either side the steps to her throne. "Leave us," she stated and her guards instantly obeyed.\n\nAurora prostrated herself on the marble floor, waiting for Daybreaker's stern yet soft command to rise. When she did, she briefly met the Empress's gaze, but she quickly averted her eyes. It was like Daybreaker could see every thought Aurora had.\n\nClicking her tongue, Daybreaker turned Aurora's face back toward her and she stated in a soothing voice, "Fear not, Aurora. I have a task for you." She smiled and faced the great bay window overlooking the spires and towers of Sanctum Solar.\n\nAurora gulped as she observed Daybreaker. Her armor glittered in her sun, the orange and gold reflecting sharply back into Aurora's eyes. As she approached, Daybreaker snarled and growled, "I have sacrificed much to protect Harmony and Order in MY Empire, and yet my own generals repay me with heresy!" Her mane pulsed a few flashes of violent purple and blue before returning to its normal orange.\n\nHer brow crinkled in anger, she stomped a hoof on the ground and barked, "You are the first of a few inquisitors that will be tasked with rooting out this heresy once and for all!" Holding up a hoof, she added, "But first, you will be dispatched to Trotsville."\n\nAs Aurora tilted her head in confusion, Daybreaker ruffled her wings and she stated, "The Solaris Speculatores has discovered it has ben harboring heretics for months. They were offered mercy, to turn over their vermin, but refused. Punish them by Holy Fire, for it is the only solution to Chaos."\n\nWalking past Aurora, she settled back down on her throne and waved a hoof dismissively. "When you return, you can deal with the heretics in the Militarium. For now, Trotsville is your target. May the Fires of My Sun aid you, Archmage."\n\nBowing, Aurora replied, "The Holy Flame shall guide me." She quickly departed, her first thought the need for a shower."
  solar.2.a:0 "I shall not fail you, my Empress!"
  solar.3.t:0 "Rooting Out Corruption"
  solar.3.d:0 "Thunderbolt Sentinel observed the small hamlet of Trotsville from the skies. "It's just part of the job," he thought, taking a deep breath and fighting back the growing lump in his stomach that was trying to move its way up his throat.\n\n"I suppose it was going to catch up to me at some point," he mused to himself, looking back at the archmage. Aurora Shinespark, or some such, Daybreaker's inquisitor to ensure he stayed loyal. They all sounded alike. All looked similar, too. She noticed the older stallion watching her and returned it with a stern glare. Shuddering, he turned back to look at the approaching hamlet. He could sense the piercing golden eyes of the archmage still focused on him.\n\nSighing, he turned and faced Aurora. Her white fur stood out against the deep oranges and reds of her cloak, and ornate rings decorated her horn. After a moment of silence, the two eying each other cautiously, he finally asked, "How do you it?"\n\nHer expression remained unchanged, and she spoke in the condescending manner as a mother would with a wayward foal. "It is a simple decision. Harmonist agitators were discovered and the citizens refused to arrest them. The Empress has decreed that—"\n\n"Yes, that all those who do not abide by true Harmony and Order are heretics." Thunderbolt finished, trying hard not to derisively spitting out the last word. "My question is: how do you condemn innocent ponies to die?"\n\nShaking her head, her deep orange mane swaying with the motion, she said, "Would you not sacrifice a few thousand innocents for the salvation of millions more? If heresy is not stamped out at the roots where it grows, it will spread to other towns. It will then spread to the cities, before reaching Sanctum Solar itself."\n\nWith a scowl, she got within inches of Thunderbolt's face. Fire as bright as the Empress' Sun shone in her eyes as she continued, "This decision is never done lightly, and I pray the souls of those who are truly loyal to the Empress will find peace in the next life."\n\nShe motioned at the pilot, who opened the bombardier doors. Below, the small houses of Trotsville began to zoom past, a few specks visible to Thunderbolt: ponies going about their day without any idea of what was going to happen.\n\n"Do not look away, Thunderbolt Sentinel. Remember the price of heresy." Aurora cantered past the general and observed out the cockpit window as the squadron unleashed their payloads on the hamlet below.\n\nThere was a bright flash, and soon heat began to assault his face. Flames began spreading across the streets of Trotsville and the screams of those who were unfortunate enough to be caught in the napalm blast reached his ears. Whether out of fear or regret, he could not say, he watched as flames engulfed the hamlet. The price of heresy. The price of challenging Daybreaker's rule."

Rumor has it he is protected by somepony in high authority."
  loyal_earth:0 "Token Earth Pony"
  loyal_earth_desc:0 "Steel Sickle is the only archmage of the Inquisitionis to be an earth pony. Because of this, she has had a chip on her shoulder for years as she was the butt of jokes for many other of her fellow archmages whenever they convened.

  overworked_secretary_desc:0 "As Sunset's assistant, Stellar Breeze was responsible for far more than a normal pony would have ever been able to take on.

Without the guiding hoof of the Empress, a pony's mind can go astray, and even the most faithful among the Adoratio can fall prey to heresy when in the darkness of foreign borders.\n\nSunset is currently [Root.SunsetsZealotryLoc]."

  EQS_CEL_sunset_redemption_meter_category_desc:0 "In her mercy, §YCelestia§! has given §YSunset Shimmer§! one attempt to prove that she has truly turned over a new leaf. She currently has naught but a few months to relearn many of the lessons taught in her youth, but if she is up to the task, the joys of harmony and friendship will be hers for the taking.\n\nSunset is currently [Root.SunsetsRedemptionLoc].\nAurora is currently [Root.AurorasRedemptionLoc]."

With the Adoratio Primus convened, a new high priestess will soon be chosen. Many of the archmages support §RPulsar Beam§! of Fillydelphia because of her many years of sacrifice, and orthodox views. Sunset wishes for her travel companion, §YAurora Shinespark§!, to be ordained instead, as she would be more amenable to the changes Sunset wishes to make to the Empire.\n\nOne of these mares will be given the reins of the Solaris Adoratio, it is merely a matter of who."

  quasar_pulse_second_greeting:0 "You've come back, have you?"
  quasar_pulse_second_offer:0 "The offer still stands. You need me to support Archmage Shinespark, I need more funds for purging heresy. It is only for heresy, I assure you."
  quasar_pulse_acceptance:0 "Excellent! I told you she'd agree, Snuggles. Very well, I look forward to what your new High Mage will do. Hopefully she doesn't get... crushed by the responsibility. *snickers*"

  blueblood_first_greeting:0 "Sunset. What an absolute PLEASURE to see you. Do you have to bother me so?" 
  blueblood_first_offer:0 "You want me to vote for who? Ugh, fine, I can support this Sparkshine pony or whoever. So long as you let me prototype some of my new military theories."
  blueblood_rejection:0 "You've always had it out for me, Shimmer! See where the Empire stands in a year without MY ideas! It'll be nothing but a pile of rubble!"
  blueblood_second_greeting:0 "What do you want now, Sunset?"
  blueblood_second_offer:0 "Oh, of all the- Fine! I'll vote for your little bitch of a priestess if you leave the Militarium alone. I need the solitude to perfect my genius strategies."

  blueblood_acceptance_assurance:0 "Do you not trust me to at least stick to my word, Sunset? Typical." #In case the player goes back after agreeing to support the voter
  seething_corona_first_greeting:0 "Sol Invictus, Princess Regent!"
  seething_corona_first_offer:0 "I've not heard much of Archmage Shinespark, but you wish for me to vote for her? Perhaps, so long as we can come to an... agreement. Considering I'm in charge of Ordo Solis, I'm not given the respect running Sanctum Solar is due. Perhaps you could fix that?"
  seething_corona_rejection:0 "I knew it! I'm surrounded by ingrates!"
  seething_corona_second_greeting:0 "Hello, Princess Regent."
  seething_corona_second_offer:0 "Not gotten enough support, I see. I suppose I have to forgive the slight you put on my honor. So long as Ordo Solis is acknowledged as the prime Ordo, then yes, I'll vote for Archmage Shinespark."
  seething_corona_acceptance:0 "*cackles* Yes! I can finally rub it in Pulsar Beam's face! So long as she doesn't become High Mage, I suppose."
  seething_corona_acceptance_assurance:0 "*giggles* I can't wait to see Pulsar Beam's expression when I come in- Hmm? Yes, I'm still voting for Archmage Shinespark. Not to worry."
  steel_sickle_first_greeting:0 "Greetings, Princess Regent Shimmer. What have you come to ask?"
  steel_sickle_first_offer:0 "Give me more tools for the farmlands. Like it or not, Ponyville and its region still provide most of the food for the Empire, after SOMEPONY drove the neighbors down south away. We can only do so much. Get me more, and I'll vote for Archmage Shinespark."
  steel_sickle_rejection:0 "You'd really let the Empire starve to save on some bits now? I pray that the Empress gives you wisdom."
  steel_sickle_rejection_alternate:0 "You've pledged money to that luddite, Iron Tail but not to me?! Are you mad?! Do you WANT to see the Empire starve?!"
  steel_sickle_second_greeting:0 "Have you reconsidered my offer?"
  steel_sickle_second_offer:0 "*mumbles* I should have been made Regent. *louder* The Empire needs more food. Ordo Messis provides most of it, and we require new and better tools to eke greater yields. Earmark a supply of them, and I'll vote for Archmage Shinespark."
  steel_sickle_second_offer_alternate:0 "*grunts* Empress give me patience. *louder* If you have any sense-although you don't since you supported Iron Tail-you'd provide funding for my farmers to make more food. Please tell me you have a LITTLE in that skull of yours."
  steel_sickle_acceptance:0 "The Empress will be pleased with your wisdom, Princess Regent. Archmage Shinespark has my support."
  steel_sickle_acceptance_alternate:0 "At least you came around in the end. I will vote for Archmage Shinespark."
  steel_sickle_acceptance_assurance:0 "Yes, Archmage Shinespark still has my vote. Please stop pestering me."
  ion_trail_first_greeting:0 "Praise the Empress! How can I assist you, Princess Regent?"
  ion_trail_first_offer:0 "I can vote for Archmage Shinespark, but I have my own troubles to worry about. Ordo Marris is currently experiencing a large uptick in heresy. I could consider Archmage Shinespark's merits if I had additional troops to search the seaboard while I'm here in Sanctum Solar."
  ion_trail_rejection:0 "I suppose you don't need my help after all. Perhaps Pulsar Beam is more amenable."
  ion_trail_second_greeting:0 "Hello again, Princess Regent. Done some thinking, have we?"
  ion_trail_second_offer:0 "Archmage Shinespark has been on my mind as of late. She was the one who found the heresy in the Militarium, no? Surely she would understand if you spared a few troops to aid another struggling Ordo, yes?"
  ion_trail_acceptance:0 "Consider Archmage Shinespark as good as HIGH-ered. Hah! I crack myself up some days."
  ion_trail_acceptance_assurance:0 "Archmage Shinespark is MAGE-orly supported by me, Princess Regent. Oh, Daybreaker, I'm really too good some days."
  iron_tail_first_greeting:0 "Yes? Oh, Princess Regent. What can I do for you?"
  iron_tail_first_offer:0 "The demands of the war forges have not gotten any less intense, but many of my ponies are working with pickaxes nearly rubbed to the nub. If you give me funding for purchasing new equipment, then consider me on board for supporting Archmage Shinespark."
  iron_tail_rejection:0 "When you run out of guns, you'll remember this day!"
  iron_tail_rejection_alternate:0 "You are fine supporting Steel Sickle's little biological tests, but you can't find funding for something practical?! Are you joking?!" #For if you support Steel Sickle before talking to Iron Tail
  iron_tail_second_greeting:0 "Have you come to reject me again?"
  iron_tail_second_offer:0 "Yes, I still need new tools. Pickaxes, industrial sluicers, explosives, you name it. I will vote for Archmage Shinespark, so long as you give me financial support."
  iron_tail_second_offer_alternate:0 "Are you going to be consistent now? Give me funding like you did with that wench, Steel Sickle, and Ordo Meurom will support Archmage Shinespark."
  iron_tail_acceptance:0 "Good! It was a pleasure doing business with you, Princess Regent."
  iron_tail_acceptance_alternate:0 "At least you came around in the end. You hear that, Sickle?! You aren't the only one who gets bits for \"honest\" work!"
  iron_tail_acceptance_assurance:0 "Don't worry, Princess Regent, Archmage Shinespark will be sitting in your former quarters in no time."
  burning_plage_first_greeting:0 "Oh! Princess Regent! What do you want to see me for?"
  burning_plage_first_offer:0 "You'd want me to support Aurora's bid for High Mage? Nopony ever seeks input from Ordo Silva. I... can't just do it for free, unfortunately. There's a lot of undeveloped land in my Ordo, and many ponies are homeless after a skirmish with Bales. Perhaps if some of our industry was diverted to construct new homes, I could pledge my support."
  burning_plage_rejection:0 "I understand. Ordo Silva isn't very important. I guess I'll have to find a way to house these ponies another way."
  burning_plage_second_greeting:0 "Princess Regent! I'm surprised you returned."
  burning_plage_second_offer:0 "*chuckles* Snuggles is a bit of a character, isn't he? *sighs* My offer is still open. But if you still don't want to alter our nation's industrial planning, I understand. But if you want me to vote for Aurora, then I need you to promise that these ponies will be given new homes. Is that possible?"
  burning_plage_acceptance:0 "R-Really?! You'll do it? Oh, okay then. I'll vote for Aurora. Thank you, Princess Regent!"
  burning_plage_acceptance_assurance:0 "Thank you again, Princess Regent. Aurora has my support. I was thinking about it anyway, to be honest."
  sunset_quasar_first_greeting:0 "Hello, Quasar. You've worked with Archmage Shinespark before. Would you support her bid to become High Mage?"
  sunset_quasar_second_greeting:0 "Yes, I've come back."
  sunset_quasar_acceptance:0 "I don't have much choice, do I? You'll get your funding, although I don't know what in Daybreaker's name you do with it."
  sunset_quasar_rejection:0 "No! The Inquisitionis has yielded no further results with all of your allocations! I have to draw the line somewhere."
  sunset_blueblood_first_greeting:0 "Blueblood. I trust you're feeling appropriately gorged today? I won't waste your time. Will you vote for Aurora Shinespark?"
  sunset_blueblood_second_greeting:0 "Obviously to tell you how much of an ass you are. I need your support. Unfortunately."
  sunset_blueblood_acceptance:0 "Why do I have the feeling that the entire city will be in ruins by next Tuesday?"
  sunset_blueblood_rejection:0 "You'll level the entire country in a week. Absolutely not."
  sunset_corona_first_greeting:0 "Sol Invictus, Archmage Corona. Would you be willing to support Archmage Shinespark to become the new High Mage?"
  sunset_corona_second_greeting:0 "Archmage Corona. I still need your support."
  sunset_corona_acceptance:0 "So long as you don't use your new perks as an excuse to use up all the champagne in Sanctum Solar, then fine."
  sunset_corona_rejection:0 "All the Ordos are equal, I don't see what your problem is. Denied."
  sunset_steel_first_greeting:0 "I need your assistance, Archmage Sickle. Archmage Shinespark is better suited than Archmage Beam for High Mage. You must vote for her."
  sunset_steel_second_greeting:0 "I need to hear it again. What did you need?"
  sunset_steel_acceptance:0 "It's a small price to pay for the Empire's survival. Very well."
  sunset_steel_rejection:0 "I've heard of some of your experiments you run in the fields. Cabbage floss? Broccoli balls? You'll use the funding for more of those, not actual farming. No."
  sunset_ion_first_greeting:0 "You can aid me by voting for Archmage Shinespark."
  sunset_ion_second_greeting:0 "Yes, you could say that."
  sunset_ion_acceptance:0 "Why did you not inform us earlier of the growing heresy? Of course I'll allocate some additonal soldiers."
  sunset_ion_rejection:0 "Ordo Marris already has the largest contingent of soldiers out of all the Ordos. You do not need more. What are you doing? Sending them into the Celestial Sea?"
  sunset_iron_first_greeting:0 "I'll be brief. I need your vote for Aurora Shinespark."
  sunset_iron_second_greeting:0 "I've come to consider your offer again, yes. I've yet to make up my mind."
  sunset_iron_acceptance:0 "We always need more weapons for protecting the Empire, especially now without the Empress guiding us. You will get your bits."
  sunset_iron_acceptance_alternate:0 "You're right. I was being hypocritical. The bits are yours."
  sunset_iron_rejection:0 "As much as I'd like to, the Empire isn't made of money. You'll have to make do with what you have."
  sunset_burning_first_greeting:0 "Hello, Plage. I need your help. You could stand between the Empire becoming worse for living in or experiencing a new golden age. Please vote for Archmage Shinespark."
  sunset_burning_second_greeting:0 "It's because you have a pleasant demeanor. I mean that literally. I swear Archmage Pulse's snake is planning how to smother me in my sleep."
  sunset_burning_acceptance:0 "The Empress has unlimited mercy! Of course we'll help get these ponies back on their hooves."
  sunset_burning_rejection:0 "I wish I could, but everything is running at full capacity, and I can't retool entire lines for weeks without disrupting other consumer goods. I'm truly sorry."
  aurora_greeting:0 "*She looks visibly nervous* Hello, Sunset."
  aurora_conversation:0 "Do I need to state the obvious? You put me forward as a candidate instead of Archmage Beam! Of course I'm going to look uneasy, she's one of the favorites of everypony here. You should see how frequently the rest of the archmages gush about her when the Ordos convene."
  aurora_conversation_second:0 "*In a slightly deriding tone* \"Oh, Archmage Beam, how did you dispose of the heresy so quickly?\" \"If we were allowed to marry, I'd want you to have my foals!\" Ugh, that last one makes me want to vomit. How did we get a stallion as an archmage, again?"
  aurora_conversation_third:0 "Right. Hard to believe that Fundamentum was the best option. Anyway, my point stands that everypony here won't be voting for me. I'm honored that you thought me worthy, Sunset, but the Primus has their eyes on another pony."
  aurora_conversation_leave:0 "I pray that you're right. Quasar especially is a viper in a pony's body. Don't trust her."
  aurora_refusal_to_talk:0 "Sorry, Sunset. I'd rather collect my thoughts, right now. Let me know what the Primus decides when they've finished their horn measuring contest."
  aurora_question:0 "Well? What are the results?"
  aurora_pleased:0 "That is... surprising. I thought that the Adoratio Primus would shoo in Archmage Beam. I suppose there's more cunning in you than it appears."
  aurora_displeased:0 "I'm not surprised. Archmage Beam is seen as more orthodox, even compared to me or Archmage Sickle. You did your best, Sunset. Thank you. I'll keep in touch."
  sunset_good_results:0 "It took a lot of begging, bribing, and stealing, but you are now the new High Mage! Sol Invictus, Aurora. I will speak with you tomorrow morning."
  sunset_bad_results:0 "I... wish I could bear good news. Pulsar Beam is the new High Mage. I'm sorry. I did my best, but everypony wanted something in return, and I couldn't cripple the Empire further. Best of luck in Manehattan, my friend."
  sunset_aurora_greeting:0 "You seem troubled. What's wrong?"
  sunset_aurora_second_conversation:0 "Fundamentum Lucis was one of three candidates. Ebriacus Vinum passed out in a pool of her own bile and Lymphatus Cultro threatened the voters with a pair of shivs. Fundamentum just showed up and acted normal."
  sunset_aurora_departure:0 "You'll be surprised, Aurora. Ponies may be willing to change their mind. After all, I have the full weight of the Empress's authority behind me now."
  sunset_pulsar_greeting:0 "Archmage Beam. You seem rather sure of yourself."
  sunset_pulsar_departure:0 "Personally, Pulsar, I wouldn't discount Aurora yet. She has some powerful influence, if you know what I mean."
  sunset_pulsar_departure_alternate_first:0 "No, not a problem at all, Pulsar. After all, you're more than qualified, since you've had no issues at all with Ordo Apparatus." #Alternate line to be a bit more snide with Pulsar
  sunset_pulsar_departure_alternate_second:0 "Except, didn't you have a time when you were flogged by a few heretics? I'm sure those skills at embarrassment will go far as High Mage. *snickers*"
  sunset_pulsar_departure_alternate_third:0 "They did call me the Alpha Bitch when I was younger for a reason. It's nothing personal, Pulsar. Aurora would simply be a better fit."
  pulsar_greeting:0 "A pleasure to see you, Princess Regent. It truly is marvelous seeing the best of the Empress debating away, isn't it? Well, aside from Blueblood. If only that oaf Horizon Sunrise was here instead."
  pulsar_conversation:0 "*laughs* But of course. I have nothing against Archmage Shinespark, but the Empire needs somepony with more years of experience than her to lead the Adoratio and Inquistionis. Everypony here already knows that."
  pulsar_conversation_second:0 "*She gives a slightly mocking pout* It'd be shameful if somepony of Archmage Shinespark's caliber were to be the new High Mage, wouldn't you think? The role needs more stability than what Ordo Multi has experienced these last couple of years."
  pulsar_conversation_third:0 "*She shrugs* Ah well, forgive me for taking up your time, Princess Regent. I look forward to our collaberation once the Adoratio Primus has cast its vote."
  pulsar_leave:0 "*huffs* I wouldn't think you to be so petty, Princess Regent. If you... convince others to elect her, you're making a grave mistake."
  pulsar_leave_alternate_first:0 "I wasn't expecting that, what with your pet that you made trying to save the Empress and all. Do you truly believe that?"
  pulsar_leave_alternate_second:0 "*She frowns and snorts* A joke, of course. Well, Princes Regent, I hope you are more mature outside the voting room."
  pulsar_leave_alternate_third:0 "*Smacks a hoof to her face* Empress, I fear for the Empire's survival."
  pulsar_refusal_to_talk:0 "We have nothing more to discuss, Princess Regent. Go spread your nepotism elsewhere." #If the player tries to speak with Pulsar again.

  ###Scripted GUIs Daybreaker's meeting with Luna###
  palace_dungeons_title:0 "Sanctum Solar Catacombs"
  dungeon_description:0 "*The walls are crumbling after hundreds of years of disuse and drips of water are audible from many different directions. Nopony has had reason to enter, save for now. Ahead is a single locked cell, and inside is a familiar form, which stirs when approached.*"
  luna_awaken:0 "*snorts and coughs as she gets to a sitting position* Who is there? Stay back! Even in my weakend state, I can still-*Her eyes widen* It's you. Have you come to mock me yet again? I would say \"fair sister,\" but you are not fair nor my sister."
  daybreaker_opening:0 "*cackles* If that is what you wish, little Luna, then I will be happy to oblige."
  luna_annoyed:0 "For what do you wish to see me? Is it not sufficient enough that my sister is gone, the Crystal Empire humiliated, and you reign over it all? Must you still taunt me to this day? *she looks away* I need not more reminders of my failure."
  daybreaker_titillated:0 "I could rub all of those in your muzzle whenever I wish. No, I'm not here to do any of that, I'm just here to watch. To gloat. A bit of big sister teasing. *chortles*"
  luna_resigned_to_mockery:0 "Is this to be the punishment for Us? To verily live the rest of Our-my years in captivity? Please, just end me."
  daybreaker_solution:0 "Oh, that is exactly what I intend to do." #Only choose this if you're boring.
  luna_frightened:0 "What? Thou wouldst not!"
  daybreaker_overjoyed_at_killing:0 "Why wouldst I not? Thou art too much of a threat to Our-Ugh, how do you even speak like that?"
  daybreaker_no_longer_flowery:0 "Like, seriously, it's just so... old! I can't believe you and Celestia spoke that way at one point. Spinstery, if you ask me."
  luna_missed_joke:0 "You art truly a comedian, wench."
  daybreaker_chiding:0 "Now, is that any way to speak to your big sister? I'll just have to make sure your punishment is suitable. How does execution by fire sound? I think it'll make you nice and toasty around this time of year."
  luna_scared_at_end:0 "Truly my sister must be dead! How else could a monster have possessed her so? Very well, I shall meet my fate with the dignity that befits my position. You will not gain any more satisfaction from defeating me, Daybreaker."
  daybreaker_mockingly_sad:0 "Aw, and I was hoping you'd beg. Tsk, I figured as much. You shall join the others in their fate. Goodbye, sister. May we never meet again."
  daybreaker_denying:0 "Now why would I want my dearest, long-lost sister to be killed? Where's the fun in that? We missed so many things that we could have done together, Lulu."
  luna_teased:0 "Do not speaketh to Us in such a way, foul viper! Thou hast not proven thyself to be Our sister in any way! Thou art the scum that We wouldst scrapeth from Our shoe!" #Fun, introspective path
  daybreaker_mockingly_dismayed:0 "Luna! Watch your language! Don't speak to your sister like that!"
  daybreaker_having_fun:0 "Especially after she's helped keep the ponies of Equestria safe. Well... relatively, anyway. *chuckles*"
  luna_done_with_daybreakers_crap:0 "Keep Our ponies \"SAFE?!\" *she kicks at the bars* Art thou mad? *she quiets down* Of course. What were We thinking? That answer is but a short distance from Our muzzle."
  luna_morbidly_curious:0 "*she is silent for a moment* How do you keep them \"safe?\" Dost thou... do you really believe all you've done for them is right?"
  daybreaker_captain_obvious:0 "Of course, sister."
  luna_does_not_want:0 "*scowls* Please, enlighten Us."
  daybreaker_is_best_first:0 "You wish me to monologue? *chuckles* I've not monologued in... oh, at least thirty years!"
  daybreaker_is_best_second:0 "Harmony failed, Lulu. The only way that it survived at all was me injecting Order into it. Celestia saw this as Stalliongrad marched on our lands, and it gave her the strength to carry on, for a time. Until she needed me."
  daybreaker_is_best_third:0 "Its ways are antiquated, naive. This world is too harsh and unforgiving to live without a solid dose of reality."
  luna_unsure:0 "*appears annoyed* And that reality is?"
  daybreaker_captain_obvious_part_deux:0 "The kind, the caring, get trampled over. If anypony is to live, they must have the mettle to willingly give up themselves to a greater purpose. My purpose. A path of Order and peace. I've almost achieved it. It only took longer because ponies resisted."
  luna_noes:0 "Thou art mad! Harmony gives ponies the freedom to live, to be themselves! Thou hast established a regime of oppression and loss!"
  daybreaker_ironic:0 "Oh, I'm mad, for sure. And that anger pushes me to go on. Soon, the changelings and Marelandia will be punished, and the world will be right once more, sister."
  luna_snaps:0 "DO NOT REFER TO US AS BLOOD, DUPLICITOUS SWINE!"
  daybreaker_condescending:0 "I am as much your sister as Celestia was, SISTER."
  luna_confused:0 "*visibly confused* What dost thou mean?"
  daybreaker_monologue_first:0 "Do you not sometimes feel it, Luna? The rage? The anger? The sadness? How they swell up, and then suddenly disappear? Surely, you can feel HER, inside of you, absorbing it. Oh, I know you can."
  daybreaker_monologue_second:0 "Obviously, I speak of Nightmare Moon. She is just as much my sister as she was Celestia's. Different ponies, but the same body. When I say that I'm your sister, Luna. I mean it. In every sense of the word. But I'm not Celestia. I'm far, far greater."
  daybreaker_monologue_third:0 "And prettier. *cackles*"
  luna_what:0 "No, Nightmare Moon was all that I was not. All the rejection I felt, I fed into-"
  daybreaker_pleased:0 "Yes, an alter-ego. What do you think I was for Celestia? She felt guilty, angry, and most importantly, lonely after you were gone. Where do you think that ended up? Me."
  luna_doh:0 "That is obvious. But even when I was lost to my madness, I was still in control. Nightmare Moon never-"
  daybreaker_tired:0 "Oh, Nightmare Moon was only toying with you. From what I learned after the fact, she was one to play games too much. It cost her everything. You hear that, Moony? You were too much of a manipulator!"
  luna_confused_again:0 "Who are you addressing?"
  daybreaker_mocking:0 "Our other dear sister, of course. An alicorn's mind is too strong to have only broken aspects of a psyche. Nightmare Moon is seeing everything, I assure you."
  luna_still_confused:0 "You speak as if it were-"
  daybreaker_goading:0 "Two separate ponies? Yes. Honestly, you should let her out more often. The black fits your dark and dreary attitude so much better."
  daybreaker_revealing:0 "Tell me, do you remember what you did in Celestia's presence after Starlight left? After she first revealed to Celestia that I existed?"
  luna_unsure_again:0 "I... wished her a farewell and a safe trip and then saw her off with you."
  daybreaker_pity:0 "Ugh, you were doing so well. No, you also flipped her the bird and called her a quote \"meddling dalcop\" that nearly \"gobermouched\" her way into casting Equestria into ruin. Oh, you also referred to her as a \"yaldmare.\""
  luna_embarrassed:0 "*blushes violently* I-I... how did you know? You can't have had heard that!"
  daybreaker_pity_some_more:0 "It's a wonder what one can see when they aren't watching what their host observes."
  luna_bemused:0 "I still do not believe you. And if that is the case, then Celestia is in there somewhere and-"
  daybreaker_deadpan:0 "Celestia is dead."
  luna_wha:0 "*stares blankly, then tears start to trickle down* W-What?! She cannot-!"
  daybreaker_done:0 "Search your feelings, sister. You know that it is true. I will leave you to ruminate. After all, we have plenty of time to catch up. *cackles*"
  luna_why:0 "N-No, that cannot be... I... Celestia could not..."
  depart_scene:0 "*Leave without saying a word*"
  daybreaker_return:0 "Oh, Luna! How is my FAVORITE sister doing?"
  luna_bored:0 "We have nothing to say to thee, knave!"
  daybreaker_insulted:0 "Pfft, like you have any choice."
  luna_bored_again:0 "*she glares harshly* So you say."
  daybreaker_prodding:0 "Have you had time to think on what I've said?"
  luna_no:0 "We will not discuss any of thine nonsense any further! Either end Us or leave Us be! *she turns around and ignores any further attempts to talk*"
  daybreaker_ticked:0 "Tsk, fine. You always were such a drag."
  adios_luna:0 "*Depart in silence.*"
  luna_refuses_to_talk:0 "*Luna is refusing to speak further at this time. She appears despondent.*"
  ###Meeting after Changelings###
  arrival_part_deux:0 "*Dim light filters through some of the barred windows of the rusted cells. They paint a thin path toward Luna.*"
  luna_angry:0 "*Luna glowers out the iron bars of the dungeon cell. She remains silent.*"
  daybreaker_gleeful:0 "Hello, sister. I have-"
  luna_you_what_bitch:0 "Do NOT call Us thine sister, dollop!"
  daybreaker_really:0 "Ugh, I really need to get your mouth cleaned sometime, sister."
  daybreaker_ignoring:0 "But I'm in a good mood today. Would you like to know why?"
  luna_bemused_deux:0 "We have a feeling that thou shalt inform us regardless."
  daybreaker_chortle:0 "*chuckles* But of course, for how could I keep this from you. I have enacted the Empire's vengeance of the changeling threat. Their queen is no more."
  luna_doesnt_care:0 "Hmm, how lovely. *she crosses her hooves and glares further*"
  daybreaker_annoyed:0 "You seriously don't want to know how it was done? What I had to sacrifice for ponykind's salvation?"
  luna_irritated:0 "Verily, We couldn't care less what thine armies achieved. It is for naught if the ponies of Equestria live under merely a different iron hoof."
  daybreaker_laughing:0 "Posh, Luna. I don't sap them for love or other emotions. Against their will, anyway. All I ask is for devotion to a cause. Mine. *cackles*"
  luna_scoffing:0 "Ah, so they are merely exchanging one harsh rule for another. We see that our statement is true."
  daybreaker_ticked_off:0 "Everything I do is for the benefit of the ponies under my rule! If it weren't for me, Equestria would be DEAD!"
  luna_deadpan:0 "It is already perished. Thou hast made sure of that."
  daybreaker_disappointed:0 "Luna, Luna, Luna. Always so quick to judgement."
  luna_interrupting:0 "We believe thou art what is called... projecting. *she gives the faintest wry smile*"
  daybreaker_outraged:0 "SILENCE!"
  luna_wut:0 "*She stares in shock*"
  daybreaker_regained_composure:0 "As I was saying. Everything I've done has been for my ponies benefit. They have stability, order, and most of all, harmony."
  luna_sigh:0 "If this is what thou believist to be harmony, then thou hast to look for a new dictionary."
  daybreaker_bruh:0 "Luna, I want to keep everything safe. For everypony."
  daybreaker_sigh:0 "*sighs* You are still my little sister, I only wish you would see the errors you are making."
  luna_are_you_serious:0 "gazes in surprise, although she starts to scowl*"
  luna_WTF:0 "Art thou mad?! Thou admittest to killing Our own SISTER and you believe thou canst simply traipse into Our prison and regard us as FAMILY?!"
  daybreaker_shocked:0 "I-"
  luna_no_way:0 "Thou only share one aspect of Celestia. You share her delusions of unity. We will never see thee as Our sister."
  daybreaker_wait:0 "But I-"
  luna_leave:0 "Leave Us, before We attempt to test the limit of Our confines. Do you wish to drive thy dear \"sister\" to death?"
  daybreaker_oh:0 "I shall go."
  luna_bye_bitch:0 "We wish thine overweight rump would depart faster!"
  end_scene:0 "I suppose I will."
  ###Meeting after Marelandia###
  arrival_the_third:0 "*For once the sunlight has radiated into the catacombs. Long shafts of yellow pierce through some of the shadowy haze and reflect off pools of water. They illuminate Luna.*"
  luna_starving:0 "*Luna doesn't stir. She remains curled on the floor and staring out the cell doors. Her ribs are visible through her fur.*"
  luna_still_angy:0 "After a moment, she coughs and sits up. The familiar scowl from previous interactions is on her muzzle.*"
  ew_rotten:0 "*There is a plate of slightly moldy food sitting beside Luna.*"
  daybreaker_concerned:0 "Surely you must be hungry, Luna? What kind of sister would I be if I didn't-"
  luna_tiredly_pissed:0 "We request, AGAIN, that thou cease referring to Us as thine sister."
  daybreaker_no:0 "Now, Luna, you mustn't be so cranky. It's probably because you haven't eaten well. You could try some of what's next to you. It looks palatable... mostly."
  luna_bruh:0 "What dost thou intend to speak to Us regarding this time? *she lays back down and gazes off into the distance* We can see thou art excited about something."
  luna_bitchy:0 "*a wry smile forms on her muzzle* Mayhap thou hast finally had a good night's rest? Or dost thou instead merely prey on thy ponies' blood for energy?"
  daybreaker_enough:0 "*sigh* For once, could you speak, NORMALLY?!"
  luna_surprised:0 "*she blinks a couple of times* Fine, Daybreaker. It was getting boring anyway. You could have at least played along for a short while. *she huffs and rolls her eyes*"
  daybreaker_annoyed_again:0 "You'd almost think that you were trapped in time for a millennium."
  luna_quiet:0 "*Luna says nothing*"
  daybreaker_conversational:0 "I suppose I could share what's gotten me so excited... Luna. Marelandia is finally gone! Squished, like the vermin they were! *cackle*"
  daybreaker_excited:0 "The Inquisitionis has its work cut out for it! Oh, I can hear the screams of MARESOC now as they're set upon a pyre! With a little poof, they'll be out of our mane forever!"
  luna_unenthused:0 "It seems then you've gotten everything you've wanted, didn't you?"
  daybreaker_orly:0 "Not just me, sister! Don't be so pouty, you know Mother always hated your moodiness!"
  luna_eyeroll:0 "*Luna rolls her eyes again*"
  daybreaker_mothering:0 "You'll make your eyes fall right out if you do that! Jeez, I'm sounding like Mother now."
  luna_get_to_the_point:0 "What do you want?!"
  daybreaker_tsk:0 "Our ponies are safe again! No more communists, no more damned changelings. Well, aside from the ones forced to repair all the damage they did in the war."
  daybreaker_ranting:0 "In only a few years, I've regained all the land that was lost do those cursed insects! They've been brought to their knees! Everypony FEARS the name of Daybreaker Sun, for I am the light that exacts vengeance for my ponies' suffering!"
  daybreaker_going_ham:0 "The Marelandians are DEAD. Mareland is now part of the Empire! Peace has been restored. Prosperity is on the horizon! Justice has been SERVED! *cackle*"
  daybreaker_oblivious:0 "Do you not see, Luna?! I have done all this to save my, OUR ponies! The wars are over, the day has been won. I'VE brought order to the Equus, to the world!"
  daybreaker_still_talking:0 "Celestia was weak! I have perfected her! She may be gone, but I've risen like a phoenix from her ashes. The griffons and their backward continent know that Daybreaker Sun will protect her ponies! Nothing will harm any of us ever again!"
  daybreaker_realized:0 "This is a new - Luna?"
  luna_bored_more:0 "*Luna is still staring into the distance. She barely registers anything.*"
  luna_distracted:0 "Hmm? Were you telling me something of interest?"
  daybreaker_worried:0 "Were you not listening to me at all? You never listened to me! Not once since-No, the time for anger is over."
  daybreaker_trying_to_be_kind:0 "I was explaining - and if you didn't have your ears full of wax, you could hear - how the Empire has been established for eternity. Nopony could ever hope to threaten-"
  luna_ok_bitch:0 "That is nice, Daybreaker. I wish you luck in ruling your new Empire. *she yawns and lies down*"
  daybreaker_what:0 "...Are you not going to eat your food, at least?"
  luna_ho_hum:0 "I am not hungry, sister."
  daybreaker_more_concerned:0 "Do not lie to me, Luna! I am your-"
  luna_shut_up:0 "Yes. My sister. *she waves a hoof dismissively* Perhaps tomorrow. I am tired. I am cold. I wish to sleep."
  daybreaker_you_sure:0 "Luna, I am asking you to keep-"
  luna_seriously_shut:0 "I do not wish to speak longer, sister. I'm sure I must be stalling you from administering your new territories. *there is a tiny bit of sarcasm to her voice*"
  daybreaker_uh:0 "Luna, don't make me-"
  luna_goodbye:0 "Farewell, Daybreaker. I wish you the best in protecting everypony. From you as much as outside threats."
  daybreaker_missing_the_point:0 "Luna..."
  luna_sleeping:0 "*She doesn't respond. Only a couple of loud snores escaping her lips.*"
  daybreaker_depart_forever:0 "Oh..."
  fin:0 "*Leave quietly and shut the door without making a sound.*"

  ordo_description_1:0 "The most populous of the Ordos, Ordo Multi is the primary manufacturer of weapons for the Solaris Militarium. Manehattan and its surrounding burrows' citizenry toil in the war forges of the Empire in preparation of eventual war. As of late, the Empress-allowed unions have grown restless, and it has taken additional focus away from maintaining order throughout the rest of the region."
  ordo_description_2:0 "Ordo Silva is one of the two sparsely inhabited Ordos of the Empire, and is mostly concerned with basic artisan goods. Comprised of conservative ponies, the Inquisitionis has had to adapt to keep stability, allowing a slightly laxer standard of heresy. Its archmage has been described as a \"nice\" pony."
  ordo_description_3:0 "A majority of the farmland of the southern Empire resides within Ordo Mellis. The chapter house for the Inquisitionis is stationed in Ponyville, to provide as much oversight to the town of heresy as possible. Archmage Steel Sickle keeps them in line with a hoof almost as solid as the Empress's."
  ordo_description_4:0 "Ordo Maris is on the rich coastline in the nook of the Celestial Sea, where many fish and different plants grow for additional nourishment for the Empire. While the laypony has not caused much issue in the Ordo, Archmage Ion Trail has been reprimanded a few times for her practical jokes she tends to pull on others."
  ordo_description_5:0 "The other industrial center of the Empire, Ordo Apparatus is focused on secondary materials for Ordo Multi and for meeting the ascetic needs of the general population. A haze hangs over the region from the many blast furnaces and other metallurgy buildings in the capital of Fillydelphia, giving a Tartarus on Equus appearance."
  ordo_description_6:0 "Smog fills much of the interior of Ordo Meurom, the region of the Empire dedicated to delving deep into the earth for resources to feed the ravenous factories of the Solar Empire. Most ponies have been hardened by the endless toiling of mining and refining of raw materials to send to the cities, a sentiment shared by the Ordo's archmage, Iron Tail."
  ordo_description_7:0 "Comprising the very heart of the Solar Empire, Ordo Solis is strictly Sanctum Solar and the region immediately around it. Much of the heart of the Solaris Adoratio and Inquisitionis resides here, with the churches tending to the needy pilgrims that visit the holiest place in the Empire and the training houses of the Inquisitionis rearing a new generation of faithful to ward off heresy."
  ordo_description_8:0 "Created after Solar Strike's rogue invasion of Marechester, Ordo Lapidis has remained isolated from the Solar Empire at large. It pays lip service, but it has never stayed very much in line with the orthodox of the wider Empire. It will take a strong hoof to get it under control and loyal to the Empress."
  ordo_description_9:0 "An area of learning and knowledge, Ordo Doctrina is filled with the academics of Bales, many of whom still hold a grudge against the Empire. Scribes and inquisitors pour over the vast pools of information that have been stored in the libraries of the former technocracy, and ponies have been rounded up routinely for heresy. There is still unrest, but they can do little with their toys removed for their \"safety.\"
  ordo_description_10:0 "Stretching over much of the western heartlands of Equestria, Ordo Caellum is the new powerhouse of the Solar Empire. As there are many flat valleys and little forest north of the Twilight Range, thousands of wind farms have been erected to harness the power of the storms that Cloudsdale now exclusively produces, which cover the entire land in a dark and foreboding atmosphere."
  ordo_description_11:0 "Ordo Munificus was constructed out of the remains of the Principality of Central Equestria, taking over much of its duty as the primary food producer for the Solar Empire. Resistance has been high as the earth pony farmers have proved extremely stubborn in accepting Imperial rule, leading to stern and harsh punishments from Archmage Bitter Harvest, up to and including burning entire fields of crops."
  ordo_description_12:0 "In honor of the swift victories that first greeted the Solar Empire in the War of the Southeast, Ordo Velocitas was ordained for the northern half of the peninsula to control the reconstruction of Balitmare and its surrounding regions. Unrest has been extremely light, with the threat of death for the slightest failures keeping the local citizens in line."
  ordo_description_13:0 "Ordo Diligentia is centered around the second Southeastern megapolis of Stableside, which was only lightly damaged in its recapture. An area filled with unrest, smog, and decaying vegetation, Ordo Diligentia is an example of how to swiftly rebuild after destruction, an effort that its archmage has taken pride in."
  ordo_description_14:0 "In the confusion of taking Stalliongrad's puppet, Ordo Confundas has been established to provide some semblance of stability in the chaotic lands bordering the de jure territories of the two nations. Despite the attempts of its archmage, the region is still rife with incompetent oafs who lead to disaster after every turn, reducing the ability to reconstruct the area."
  ordo_description_15:0 "Stretching from the southwest of the Severyana region to the Griffish Isles, Ordo Servus is a mix of various industrial and agrictultural hubs that fed the former lands of Stalliongrad. Centered around Altigrad, the ordo is dedicated to producing various consumer goods and foods for the rest of the Empire through utilizing the old tools of the communist nation."
  ordo_description_16:0 "Ordo Ferox is situated around the general region of Stalliongrad, the former communist capital used for its various military factories to churn out endless weapons of war. Despite constant oppression by the Inquisitionis, there are many cells of rebels who wish to see Stalliongrad return, with frequent protests a common sight in the ordo."
  ordo_description_17:0 "Situated on the border between desert and lush grassland, Ordo Praeda is sparesly populated and has little mineral wealth for the Empire. Most of the ponies are rugged and have already led multiple attempted uprisings against the Solaris Inquisitionis, requiring a larger presence of soldiers to keep the area pacified."
  ordo_description_18:0 "Aptly named, Ordo Infernum comprises the hottest but most resource-rich areas of the southwest of the Equus continent. While overburdened by the changeling-backed oligarchy, the land has only further declined under Solar control. The desert spreads and the heat swells further, leaving everypony there hot and miserable as they toil on the oil fields."
  ordo_description_19:0 "Ordo Mercatura has already become a center of trade within the Empire. With the many ports and railroad connections in Las Pegasus, freight and logistics travel through the hub and enriches the businessponies allowed to operate. Currently, a mission from the Adoratio has been established to "cleanse the populace of their debauchery," which has led to more than a few public burnings of the worst sinners."
  ordo_description_20:0 "As one of the border Ordos with Changelingia, Ordo Litus is the primary stop point for soldiers on their way to the front line. Many changelings live in the region, as Chrysalis attempted to permanently expand her population's core territory, and have been placed firmly as second-class. Numerous dockyards dot the cities, where they are put to work forging new warships for Changelingia's destruction."
  ordo_description_21:0 "Most ponies of the Solar Empire do not remember the lands that comprise Ordo Salus. As some of the first territory gained by the changelings, much of the landscape and culture has been altered. Changeling is an official language spoken by many, including the pony populace of the region. This barrier has made establishing control over the populace much more difficult, while slowing monuments to the Empire's victory."
  ordo_description_22:0 "Less an Ordo and more a puppet nation, Ordo Tenuis is established on the de facto borders of the Crystal Empire. In a short time, the Crystal City has been rebuilt into a heavy industrial hub, with multiple kinds of magical clouds are discharged into the sky, polluting the nearby lands with residual energies from the crystal refining process. Mines have cut through much of the northern mountain range, which in turn extract those crystals for the Empire's further use."

  solarordo.1.d:0 "With a slightly shaky hoof, Quasar Pulse, Lady Inquisitor of the Solar Empire, knocked on the massive wooden doors in front of her. On either side of the frame, a soldier dressed in brilliant golden armor stood at attention. Everything was quiet. Too quiet.\n\nSquinting at one of the guards for a second, she could see him begin to sweat as her eyes traced over his form. \"I could crush him in a second as an example to the other!\" she thought to herself, if only for a moment. It was tantalizing, the raw power she could hold over them, but it was not why she was here.\n\nAfter a couple seconds, there was the sound of hooves wearing metal shoes clanking on a stone floor. A lock was fiddled with, and then a latch released, presenting Quasar with a small sliver of a view to the inside room. In front of her, the whelp that High Mage Shimmer used as a glorified secretary. What was her name? Smellar Sneeze?\n\n\"I am here to see High Mage Shimmer,\" she said, letting a bit of pomp slip into her voice.\n\nThe yellow pony on the other side of the door stared at her for a second. In a deadpan tone, she stated, \"High Mage Shimmer is incredibly busy taking care of your previous mess, Lady Inquisitor-\"\n\n\"Do not be coy with me, insolent rat!\" Quasar spat as she powered her horn, ripping at the door with her magic and cracking the wood into slivers.\n\nSunset's servant winced and staggered back, allowing Quasar to barge through the cloud of razor-sharp wood, her cloak billowing behind her. When she entered, Sunset Shimmer looked up from her dark oak desk. On either side of her were some bookcases, and on her left, the sun brightly illuminated her greying fur and mane.\n\n\"Quasar,\" Sunset muttered, dropping the quill she was using and rubbing a temple. \"What is it now?\"\n\nSmugly pushing aside Sunset's maid, Quasar approached the desk and slammed both her forehooves on it. \"The Inquisitionis requires more funds! Heresy is rife in the palace. I can smell it!\" For emphasis, she sniffed hard before she sneered at Sunset.\n\nEars falling flat, Sunset sighed and massaged her forehead further. \"Quasar, everypony here is constantly under surveillance. How could anypony even possibly be a heretic?\"\n\n\"Heresy knows no limits, High Mage,\" Quasar responded, giving only a single snort before sneering. \"Everypony is guilty until proven innocent.\"\n\nMomentarily staring at Quasar, Sunset finally groaned and mumbled under her breath, \"You're not going to let this go?\" She shook her head and waved a hoof. \"Fine, you have my blessing. Sniff out this heresy, Lady Inquisitor.\"\n\n\"Sol Invicta!\" Quasar exclaimed, her heart fluttering with the glee of a five-year-old filly. Soon she would see the enemies of the Empress crushed, driven before her, and hear the lamentations of their fillies.\n\n\"Sol Invicta,\" Sunset replied, beating her chest with a hoof and then motioning for her to leave. \"Repair the door if you can on the way out.\""
  solarordo.2.d:0 "Pressing down her cloak for a moment, Quasar Pulse sneered as she shot her gaze between the two guards on either side of the doorframe. It was time.\n\nWithout bothering to announce herself, she pushed the doors open with her magic and felt a heavy thud as something smacked into the opposite side. As she stepped through, she looked down and saw that she had whacked Sunset's yellow-furred slave, Cellar Cheese.\n\nAlthough it had been a few months since Sunset had approved of her grand crusade against heresy, Quasar believed it had been most productive. Dozens of ponies, all extensively studied, occasionally questioned, and maybe interrogated at gunpoint a few times were in files held in her saddlebags. Now it was only a matter of presenting them to Sunset.\n\nOnce again, Sunset was busy working on something with a quill, and she groaned as she put the instrument away and looked up. Dark circles and visible wrinkles underlined her eyes, which were made only more tired-looking from the muted, overcast sky. Without saying a word, Sunset motioned with a hoof for Quasar to speak.\n\nGrinning, Quasar dropped the piles of dossiers on Sunset's desk and stood back. An eager nicker worked its way through her throat, and she could barely keep from standing still. The anticipation was killing her.\n\nFor a short while, Sunset silently worked her way through the files. She eventually stopped, and looked up, \"'The maid who occasionally cleans Blueblood's room?'\"\n\n\"She always does a horrible job, High Mage.\"\n\nNodding unenthusiastically, Sunset went through another. Arching a brow, she asked, \"'Cinnamon, the dish washer on the third-floor kitchen?'\n" She snorted. \"Did he put too much spice in your hayburgers one day?\"\n\n\"I eat nothing but grass and carrots, High Mage,\" Quasar retorted, keeping her face straight and staring at her superior with a touch of disgust. \"Snuggles can have whatever he wants, though,\" she added in reference to her pet.\n\n\"Of course," Sunset snarked, tossing the file into a pile with the first one. After digging through more of them, she hummed to herself. \"'Hot Air was spotted speaking with later-captured heretics... Golden Spoon was heard expressing their distaste that the Empress had yet to fulfill her promise of funding her monument project... Hedge Fund was caught reading a book on sun jokes...'\"\n\n\"There is more,\" Quasar stated, tapping additional files, \"but I have provided enough evidence. This has been a formality.\" She stood up, grabbing the dossiers in her magic. \"I trust you're not getting second thoughts.\"\n\n\"Never!\" Sunset declared with a wave of her hoof. Glancing to the side, she stated, \"Go, you can have your little crusade. Sol Invicta!\"\n\nNarrowing her eyes, Quasar stared at Sunset for a second before whirling around and storming out of the room. As she slammed the door, she heard another thud as she caught Sunset's bondmare on the chin."
  solarordo.3.d:0 ""I do not see why I must be your guinea pig," Sunset's servant, Teller Teas, protested as Quasar Pulse and a couple of other inquisitors stood in one of the spacious halls of the Imperial Palace.\n\nSome ponies were currently bustling around them, giving a small berth to Quasar especially as she gently rubbed the head of Snuggles. The boa constrictor hissed contentedly and coiled slightly tighter around her torso in a scaly hug.\n\nWith a snort, Quasar flicked her head in the direction of the hallway. Currently engrossed in a surely stimulating conversation with another bureaucrat, Inkstain shifted his eyes over his shoulder. However, Quasar and her squad were hidden in the bustle of the morning hoof traffic, and he went back to his discussion.\n\n"It is simple," Quasar stated with a hint of exasperation. "You are our distraction. He was to meet with High Mage Shimmer today, you are merely there to take him to her. We will position ourselves to prevent an escape."\n\nThe yellow unicorn was clearly unconvinced. Sighing, she hung her head and nodded, wordlessly trudging toward Inkstain. After a moment, she reached him and began to direct him toward Quasar. With a sneer, Quasar stood and gave a soft shrug. Snuggles slithered his way off and behind a nearby pillar.\n\nMoments later, Feller Fleece brought him into view of Quasar, and he instantly froze. "Good," Quasar mused to herself, and stomped toward him.\n\n"L-Lady Inquisitor," Inkstain mumbled as he gave her a small bow and nervously peered at her. "What can I do for you?" When Quasar remained quiet, he tittered and took a couple of steps back, "I-I'm afraid that I'm quite busy, I c-can make time for you-"\n\n"That won't be necessary," she replied, drawing her muzzle back into a vicious grin. "This will be the last appointment on your itinerary." She walked closer. Flicking her tail, she began, "Tell me, does last Wednesday at the twenty-second hour ring a bell to you?"\n\nLaughing, Inkstain declared, "I'm afraid you're going to have to be more specific than that-" He paused when he felt something slither up his leg. Looking down, he screamed as Snuggles wound his way around Inkstain's legs and pull tight. Within seconds, Inkstain was in a bundle of scales, only his head remaining unburied.\n\nSquirming, he yelped as there was a soft crack from his torso and his breathing grew ragged. With effort, he demanded, "W-What is the meaning of this?!" Another shriek escaped him as Snuggles wound tighter.\n\nCoyly, she glanced at him and clicked her tongue. She slapped him lightly on the cheek. "You do not question an inquisitor, heretic!"\n\n"H-Heretic?! I-" He coughed and groaned as the coils tightened further.\n\n"Silence!" Quasar lit her horn and yanked him forward, part of his muzzle contorting with the strength of her grasp. "You will tell all before this is over. Everything about your operations, and your little, heretical friends!"\n\nCackles echoed through the halls, almost drowning out the crunch of bone and screams for mercy."
  solarordo.4.d:0 "New data suggests that the investments of funds into Ordo Multi have paid off. Recent figures from the primary forges in the Bronks and Manehattan Island indicate that hundreds of more firearms and tanks are produced every day in the city. Due to the attention from Sanctum Solar, morale has soared to a new high in the region and the archmage reports that heresy has dropped considerably as more ponies find work in the cities."
  solarordo.5.d:0 "Recent news from Ordo Silva indicates our propaganda campaigns have borne fruit. With new factories churning out weapons, a number of ponies have volunteered for sevice in the Solaris Militarium. Orthodox thinking has also increased, with far less deviancy threatening the stability of the Adoratio's doctrine."
  solarordo.6.d:0 "With the increased storage of food in Ordo Mellis, recent demographcis have indicated a small population boom in the general area. Many new families have moved to Sanctum Solar for potential work and the superior education of its church schools and to ensure that their foals will be cleansed of their sins."
  solarordo.7.d:0 "After finding appropriate ships to requisition, Ordo Maris has done as instructed and refit the best civilian vessels to become new warships. They are not purpose-built, but they will be effective patrol vessels to guard our waters from potential threats and alert the Imperial Armada."
  solarordo.8.d:0 "Compared to Ordo Solis and Multi, Ordo Apparatus was falling behind on industrialization and production quotas. Our stimulus has been put to good use, and numerous factories and refineries have been built to fuel a rapid spike in output for both the civilian and military sectors."
  solarordo.9.d:0 "The central lands of the Solar Empire have many untapped pockets of natural resources that have yet to be mapped. With our funding, Ordo Meurom has finished a month-long process of surveying the region and establishing new mining operations where significant deposits were discovered. Already, shipments have been flowing between the Ordos to furnish further expansion of military industries."
  solarordo.10.d:0 "After months of propaganda and training, new regiments are ready for orders from Ordo Lapidis. Additionally, ponies have expressed more desire to serve in the Militarium and to protect the fringes of the Empire from any possible Harmonist threat in response to these new information campaigns."
  solarordo.11.d:0 "Much of the knowledge that [BLS.GetNameDef] had hoarded for themselves after ceding from the Empire has been recovered. Dozens of scribes spent hundreds if not thousands of combined hours to unlock any secrets that Bunsen Beaker and the other members of the Directorate might possibly have uncovered. Although much of it is clearly heresy and must be destroyed - along with those who read it - there are some interesting avenues of research regarding ponykind's inherent magic. It would be trivial to continue the experiments, if funding was provided and the Empress's eye was turned the other way."
  solarordo.12.d:0 "As Ordo Caellum is an amalgamation of different regions of the western heartlands' culture, it is surprising that so much ahs been done in such short order. Reports indicate that mining has boomed, which has fed back into the industries in Cloudsdale. Along with this, the weather factories report increased yield, allowing our new weather farms to power more of the Empire for less. In all, the Ordo has placed itseful as a useful asset with remarkable speed."
  solarordo.13.d:0 "With the last of the purges of the old nobility finished, Ordo Munificus reports that many of its conscripts have been freed from maintaining order and are free for stationing elsewhere within the Empire. On top of this, many farmers have been replaced by industrial machines, meaning there are many more bodies that can be put on the front line. Even if they have qualms, supplying for their families will drive them to serve, if nothing else."
  solarordo.14.d:0 "The latest dispatches from Ordo Velocitas relay that the final steps in creating a new civilian fleet have been finalized. Now that their new drydocks are free, they can be tasked with constructing for the Empire. Recently, new crystal veins have also been found on the Dragon Isles, and mining operations have begun. We shall soon see the benefits of the exploitation."
  solarordo.15.d:0 "Despite being the other major industrial center of the former South-eastern Governorate, Stableside has seen its fair share of decay. With our recent investments, many of the slums and ghettos that were erected in former industrial districts have been cleared, and new factories have been constructed in their place to feed the Empire's war machine. They will have to find another place to squat, or they can work in the sweatshops themselves for a chance fo survival."
  solarordo.16.d:0 "To say that [AWR.GetNameDef]'s economy was a mess would be the understatement of the past millennium. While it was expected there would be resistance to being pressed into service, instead the Militarium was met with open arms, as many ponies were promised food and a place to sleep. New regiments await our generals' orders as we speak."
  solarordo.17.d:0 "Before Stalliongrad revolted from Equestria, St. Petershoof was an industrial powerhouse of the north-east. However, Sinister Serov had let the city degrade as he focused further on his pet project norht of Stalliongrad proper. With the repair and repurposing of the steel mills in Altigrad, the old city can be useful once more, and it can also exhaust more communists to prevent them from growing insubordinate against our rule."
  solarordo.18.d:0 "As there is plenty of aluminium in the regions around Stalliongrad, we have diverted more production to the fighter factories in the city. Although never known for superior craftsponyship, the results from the arms factories will be welcome as we continue to rebuild the airforce in preparation for future wars."
  solarordo.19.d:0 "As it is sparesly populated, Ordo Praeda has little left for us to exploit or add to. Appleloosa is one of the only major cities of the region, and we have provided some funds to expanding its industrial base. Additionally, small deposits of oil have been prospected in the desert, which will help build our future reserves."
  solarordo.20.d:0 "It's the motherload! Beneath the scorching heat of the sun in the San Palomino desert, our surveyors have found gushers of oil! New pumpjacks are already being erected, but it's still going to take time for full production to begin. As the Militarium relies on more and more fuel-hungry tools, this has not come at a better time. Praise the Empress!"
  solarordo.21.d:0 "For once, there is little to report from an Ordo. Abhorrently Rich is the only archmage that has paid their way into service, and she has provided more benefit in a few short months than most Ordos have in their lifetime. According to her, she's recruited a couple of experts in manufacturing and finance for us to utilize at our pleasure. We shall see how helpful they truly are."
  solarordo.22.d:0 "In the buil-up to the Great War, a new Lunar Ocean fleet was commissioned and began construction in Vanhoover. During this entire time, the hulls have been laid in drydock, rusting and seeing disuse. Now that we control the city again, we used restoration spells to repair the hulks and get them into military service. They may be old, but they will bring added firepower to our navy whe it is needed most."
  solarordo.23.d:0 "Construction has finally ceased in [690.GetName], and we can admire our slaves' labor. A massive monument now rests in front of Chrysalis' old quarters in the city, proclaiming Daybreaker's salvation to everypony. We have done it. We have freed the Empire! Sol Invictus!"
  solarordo.24.d:0 "Reports from Ordo Tenuis indicate that our mining surveyors have not come back empty-hooved. Many veins of minerals and crystals, all useful in magical application, have been discovered in the northern mountains. Mines will be set up shortly, and soon they will be extracted for the Empire's use in both weapons and defense matrices."
  solarordo.26.d:0 "Initiating this project is §Rpermanent§!. We do not control the rest of the Ordo at this time. Do you wish to proceed?"
  solarordo.27.d:0 "After pushing through longer working hours, the ponies of the manufactories have finished their quotas, and have gotten us more weapons to serve the Empire. Their sacrifice will not be in vain!"
  
  solarordo.1.a:0 "Their loyalty will be proven with fire!"
  solarordo.2.a:0 "You are not sympathetic to them, are you?"
  solarordo.3.a:0 "There are more where he came from!"
  solarordo.4.a:0 "Excellent News!"
  solarordo.5.a:0 "They will be put to use."
  solarordo.6.a:0 "Future soldiers of the Empire!"
  solarordo.7.a:0 "Station them to protect the coasts."
  solarordo.8.a:0 "More steel!"
  solarordo.9.a:0 "The riches of the earth await us!"
  solarordo.10.a:0 "They will serve until death."
  solarordo.11.a:0 "Unorthodox, but it will be allowed."
  solarordo.12.a:0 "They have quickly proven their worth."
  solarordo.13.a:0 "Their plowshares have become swords."
  solarordo.14.a:0 "There is much to be gained."
  solarordo.15.a:0 "Armed and operational."
  solarordo.16.a:0 "It is not a mercy. It is a punishment."
  solarordo.17.a:0 "A strength of the East."
  solarordo.18.a:0 "They are safe, yes?"
  solarordo.19.a:0 "Useful."
  solarordo.20.a:0 "Power for the machines!"
  solarordo.21.a:0 "Their knowledge will be most helpful."
  solarordo.22.a:0 "The ancients awaken."
  solarordo.23.a:0 "Let them gaze upon it and despair!"
  solarordo.24.a:0 "Crystals!"
  solarordo.26.a:0 "Yes, continue."
  solarordo.26.b:0 "No, we can hold off a little longer."
  solarordo.27.a:0 "Well done."
