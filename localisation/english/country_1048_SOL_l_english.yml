  ###Leader Descriptions###
  POLITICS_DAYBREAKER_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: At least 2000 BLB\n\n§YBiography§!: For eons, the land of Equestria was protected by two sister alicorns to rule over the day and night. Their serene guidance helped establish strong ties between ponies, forming harmony that lasted for generations to come. Little is known where the sisters, Celestia and Luna, originated from. In their early rule, many venerated them as gods before they were kindly corrected.\n\nThe harmony of Equestria would not last, however, as the Great War of 1011 would shatter the idyllic outlook of her ponies. Out of this chaos, Daybreaker would emerge. She answered the call, overpowering what sanity Celestia had left to provide the final solution to her problems: unending, overwhelming firepower.\n\nDaybreaker is everything Celestia was not: pompous, arrogant, self-centered, aggressive. Her ponies are merely tools to her, the Solaris Adoratio (Solar Cult), the outlet to keep their fears at bay. Despite the decades since the collapse of the great Solar Empire, many still worship at her hooves, and Imperial society is one of endless adoration and sacrifice. Daybreaker cares little beyond one day reclaiming her rightful place as ruler, not just of the lands of Equestria, but one day the world. All will worship the sun, and Daybreaker will be the herald of their salvation.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: RyanBoi"
  POLITICS_CELESTIA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: At least 2000 BLB\n\n§YBiography§!: Long before the chaos of modern times, the land of Equestria was ruled by two sisters. One controlled the day; another controlled the night. Together, they led their ponies into an era of prosperity, peace, and happiness. These sisters, Celestia and Luna, were alicorns: powerful beings that bore the magical properties of all three species of pony. For centuries they ruled, but it would not last.\n\nLuna fell to the darkness, and Celestia was forced to seal her away in the moon, lest she destroy the world through her hubris. As Celestia was close to her sister, she grew distant and cold, plunging Equestria into a short time of intense heat. Strict laws were enacted, and her ponies chafed. At the peak of this, she reflected and saw herself repeating Luna's mistakes, and she stepped back from the precipice. This would continue for a thousand years, until Luna returned.\n\nIn the aftermath, the world experienced rapid development. Celestia believed that, with her reformed sister, they could weather the tides and live peaceful coexistence. This error in judgement cost her everything: her ponies, her country, her very self.\n\nFor forty years, she watched her alter ego, Daybreaker bring suffering to what was left of the nation of Equestria. Now that she is finally returned, she is wiser.\n\nAlthough she is much more merciful and serene than Daybreaker, her experiences have hardened Celestia's resolve. Now far more pragmatic, her kindest tendencies have faded to give way to a desire to see her wayward ponies protected from all that would threaten them. Her beloved nation, Equestria, will one day be restored, and her serene guidance will lead it into another golden era.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: flamevulture17"
  POLITICS_AURORA_SHINESPARK_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 1021 ALB\n\n§YBiography§!: One of the youngest ponies to achieve the rank of Archmage in the Solaris Inquisitionis, Aurora Shinespark grew up staunchly in the hardest portions of the Solar Empire. Raised in Manehattan, she experienced the first union riot of 1032, where she earned her cutie mark in infernal magic defending a pair of citizens from rogue workers.\n\nWhen she reached the appropriate age, she attended former Princess Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns, now Daybreaker's College for Talented Mages. Successfully reaching the rank of Mage, she was given a position as lieutenant of the former Archmage of her home city, Nebula Flare. However, Nebula Flare was declared a heretic, and fled the country, placing the fairly green Aurora in charge of the chapter.\n\nUnder her leadership, she held the peace in Manehattan, although little was done to resolve the unrest. While she can have a hoofs-off methodology, when pushed she will retaliate with appropriate force. As a loyal inquisitor, she ensures that ponies are kept in line.\n\nNow the Princess Regent, Aurora leads the nation with stern justice. Little of the entrenchment of the Adoratio and Inquisitionis in government has been addressed. Primarily, her goals are reconquest of the nation, ensuring that the position she was entrusted in follows Daybreaker's vision. The Empress' memory will be honored, and she will be venerated as the immortal, unstoppable being she is.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
  POLITICS_SUNSET_SHIMMER_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 980 ALB\n\n§YBiography§!: Once the friendship student of Celestia, Sunset Shimmer grew jealous of other ponies and their rapid advancement through Celestia's school. She was not a stupid student, in fact she was a genius, but she considered friends and spending time with them beneath her. In 999 ALB, she broke into the forbidden library of the Canterlot Palace and found her escape. She would run to another world, return with its inhabitants, and conquer Equestria, setting herself up as its new ruler.\n\nThat did not go according to plan, and she was stopped by Celestia's following student, Twilight Sparkle. Although offered a place to return to, she insisted on residing with her new friends in this new world. The honeymoon period was short, and soon Sunset began to grow irritated with many of her friends' quirks.\n\nAlthough she remained connected with them, she let them drift apart, and when Daybreaker summoned her, she answered the call. Daybreaker trained her, forging her into the first leader of the revitalized Solaris Adoratio. Replacing Padlock Key, Sunset rebuilt the order from the ground up, making it the paramilitary arm of Daybreaker's control. All aspects of public life were dictated by the priestesses and battlemages of the order.\n\nBut, she was not satisfied. The Adoratio proclaimed to be family yet did not act like it. Change was still needed, and with Daybreaker's incapacitation, she has that chance. Solar society is still strict, but it is fair. Ponies have the freedom to worship Daybreaker as they wish, and already the spark of unity in the nation is resurging. For however long she lives, Sunset will ensure the memory of both her mentors lives on, forever engrained in the culture.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
  POLITICS_BLUEBLOOD_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 978 ALB\n\nBorn to some minor nobles in Canterlot, Blueblood was originally set for a life of middling success, petitioning for new laws or other bureaucratic monotony. However, after his parents' untimely demise, something he claimed he had no part in, the former Princess Celestia adopted him and treated him as her nephew. Overnight, Blueblood was catapulted into the lap of luxury, something which has stuck with him ever since.\n\nLike his counterpart, Sunset Shimmer, he was raised to learn the ways of friendship and harmony. Usually he managed to at least appear more competent in it, which he would lord over Sunset until she disappeared. After she vanished, little motivated him to continue his studies, and he devoted more time to dabbling in war and military theory than anything else.\n\nAs tensions with the changelings grew, Celestia knew that having somepony with knowledge on war would be imperative, and he was promoted to field marshal in 1010. Troops under his command soon complained of the pedantic nature of his requests, as he usually squandered supplies meant for the front lines.\n\nHowever, he was kept, and after Daybreaker's ascension, was given the title of Lord Commander of the Solaris Militarium, giving him near total control over the general army of the Solar Empire. Daybreaker still could pull rank over him, and this caused both to butt heads on numerous occasions. Now, with his successful coup, nopony can challenge his power.\n\nFrom his new position as Supplicant of the Empress, he has slowly started to reshape Imperial society. Despite being fat and lazy, his arrogance drives his one remaining passion: bending the citizenry to kneel before him. He, like the Empress before him, deserves total adoration, and all of the Empire will acknowledge him as Daybreaker's rightful successor.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
  POLITICS_DYX_DESC:0 "\"What? You want to know when I was popped out of her? I don't know, why do I have to be the damn chronicler?\n\n \"Yeah, the name's Dyx, and you probably know me as that bitch who is Daybreaker's kid. Guess what? That ain't an exaggeration. Do you think I just dyed my mane to look like little Empress Mommy over there? Please! I'd rather make it hot pink. Oh! Or blood red. Yeah! That'd be cool! Gotta find a way to do that...\n\n\"You want to know MORE about me? Jeez, why you gotta be so curious? I like dogs, long walks on the beaches, and a big serving of it's none of your Mommy-damned business, that's what. You want to know how I'll do in a fight? Sure, give me a gun, some cigs, maybe a bit of bubblegum, and we can kick some flank. How's that sound?\n\n\"Now get out of my face! You're cramping my style.\n\n\"Oh yeah, this beautiful mug was captured by §Y2hrnap§!. Weird name, but whatever. They got my good side.\""
  
  ###Unit Leaders###
  swift_waifu_desc:0 "§gBorn in Severyana, 967, Swift Wing was raised among her three older brothers. They were often two trots away from poverty, and thus it was no surprise that when their father enlisted for the Equestrian Guard, he took his children with him to Canterlot. Swift Wing received advanced education in one of Canterlot's private school. Once she became eligible for enlistment, she joined a different unit than her father's. Swift Wing's constitution ensured she passed the most rigorous exercises, towering over most of the stallions. When Severyana rose up in rebellion, she did not side with her homeland, stressing that loyalty to Equestria comes first and foremost. Afterward during the first Changeling invasion in 1002, Swift Wing was blinded in her right eye when a stray grenade detonated too close. She continued to serve in the Royal Engineer Corps regardless in a supporting role. Her tenacity in the face of injuries and setbacks inspires the soldiers under her command.§!""

  purging_the_remnant_desc:0 "Although the Empress has ruled for almost forty years, there are still heretics that defy her deity. Starlight Glimmer and Trixie Lulamoon are chiefest among them, and have organized resistance cells for decades. The Empress has tolerated them long enough! The Inquisitionis will scour the Empire in search of their location, beginning with weaklings in the Solaris Militarium."
  
  burning_the_countryside:0 "Burning the Countryside"
  burning_the_countryside_desc:0 "It would be impossible for Starlight and Trixie to remain undetected in urban centers, for the Empress's presence is all ecompassing there. There are indications they've organized in the sympathetic towns and villages, and that is where the Inquisitionis will search."
  
  incinerating_the_chaff:0 "Incinerating the Chaff"
  incinerating_the_chaff_desc:0 "Once the site of a great battle between the Solaris Adoratio and the heretical harmonists, Ponyville has been a hotbed of heretics since its capture, and the local chapter there has been largely ineffective. The cancer shall be rooted out, and the heretics will be interrogated."
  
  dead_shall_find_solace:0 "In the Empress, the Dead Shall Find Solace"
  dead_shall_find_solace_desc:0 "A heretic in Ponyville indicated that there were some cells that festered in the heartland of the Empire. Starting with the farmers, the Inquisitionis will storm through and purify the land, investigating any clues to the location of Starlight and Trixie."

  shatter_and_uproot_desc:0 "Little progress has been made! Rumors are abounding that Starlight and Trixie are stirring up a large rebellion, and time is of the essence. The simpletons in the mines and forestries will tell all, as they have probably been turned for years."
  
  truth_in_flame:0 "The Truth in the Flame"
  truth_in_flame_desc:0 "At last, we have found a pony who knows something. A mine forestallion attempted to flee as the Inquisitionis worked through his station. There is already more than enough evidence to convict him of heresy, it is only a matter of how much he will tell."
  
  scouring_the_cities:0 "Scouring the Cities"
  scouring_the_cities_desc:0 "While the Empress may be all-seeing, she still can not notice every little detail at once. It may be counterintuitive, but it is likely that Starlight and Trixie have based themselves out of one of the hive cities of Fillydelphia or Manehattan. Focus shall be leveled there."
  
  clearing_the_filth:0 "Clearing the Filth"
  clearing_the_filth_desc:0 "Fillydelphia has a large population of disenfranchised and homeless ponies. What better breeding ground for heretical teachings and disloyalty? It will only be a small fire that cleanses them, and they are of little other value. Perhaps there will be clues in the ashes."
  
  a_clue_in_the_darkness:0 "A Clue in the Darkness"
  a_clue_in_the_darkness_desc:0 "Unsurprisingly, there was little to be gleaned from the fringes of society. However, the pipes of Fillydelphia would provide ample space for operating unseen..."
  
  inquisitionis_in_the_sewers:0 "Inquisitionis in the Sewers"
  inquisitionis_in_the_sewers_desc:0 "After far too long, the Inquisitionis has captured a worker with knowledge of the harmonic resistance. He was protected by a pair of unicorns who opened fire on the inspecting mages, and was subsequently captured. He shall be most helpful."
  
  empress_give_wisdom:0 "For the Empress Shall Give Us Wisdom"
  empress_give_wisdom_desc:0 "Pointed by the last heretic, we've raided a house outside of Fillydelphia and returned with a new heretic. This Slick Deal has already blubbered ad nauseum his innocence, and should be easily broken to speak the truth."
  
  demolishing_the_dredges:0 "Demolishing the Dredges"
  demolishing_the_dredges_desc:0 "Manehattan, while well off, still suffers from bouts of heresy and communism. At the moment, a large protest is underway, and it provides ample opportunity to arrest "aggressive" members."
  
  scorched_salvation:0 "Scorched Salvation"
  scorched_salvation_desc:0 "From the union members, we have determined that some of the mill workers have funneled supplies to certain dead drop locations throughout the seaboard. Nothing is concrete, but it isn't a problem that can't be solved by a little heat."
  
  chat_with_mayor:0 "A "Chat" with the Mayor"
  chat_with_mayor_desc:0 "Manehattan is growing more rotten by the day, and it is only possible because of Mayor Goldmane's incompetence, or willing cooperation. Whichever it is, he will not have to worry about the state of his city for long."
  
  purification_through_fire:0 "Purification through Fire"
  purification_through_fire_desc:0 "Although he didn't know anything, Goldmane's office has been funneling bits into dummy accounts. These accounts have either been drained into others, or closed. However, one was tied to his assistant. They shall be most informative."
  
  knowledge_is_power:0 "Knowledge is Power, Hide It Well"
  knowledge_is_power_desc:0 "We now know that Starlight and Trixie will be attempting an insurrection in Manehattan. Although it is unknown why they are planning a bold move such as this, it requires utmost attention. Speculatores shall be dispatched to infiltrate lower levels of society, and hopefully, find out when this will occur."

  capturing_economy:0 "Capturing the Civilian Economy"
  capturing_economy_desc:0 "Despite the Empress's best efforts, there are still many ponies who believe that their private assets are solely theirs. Some visits from local inquisitors will quickly resolve the issue, and their land will become part of the State's."
  
  second_census:0 "The Second Imperial Census"
  second_census_desc:0 "Not since the Great Collapse following the war with the changelings has the Imperial Statistics Committee accurately tabulated the number of ponies living within the Imperium of the Sun. Acolytes and Initiates of the Adoratio and Inquisitionis will be used to gather the data. It will surely help with tracking down a few lingering harmonists."
  
  heretics_not_apply:0 "Heretics Need Not Apply"
  heretics_not_apply_desc:0 "While it is impossible to prevent heretics from slipping into the working population, implementing tighter controls and tests for loyalty and faith in the Empress will root out previously undetected threats. Reassurance that the Inquisitionis will punish all those that are found will only benefit society in the end."
  
  reeducating_unions:0 "Reeducating the Unions"
  reeducating_unions_desc:0 "While outside of Manehattan they are a rarity, some more prominent unions have been protesting Daybreaker's latest rounds of taxes and reworked labor laws. If they believe they are so knowledgeable about the workings of the economy, they can give the Empress their thoughts in person. Before they perish."
  
  quotas_harsh_but_necessary:0 "Quotas: Harsh but Necessary"
  quotas_harsh_but_necessary_desc:0 "It has become clear that to dredge the Empire's economy out of the gutter that the remnants of the free market must be clamped down upon. One of the first orders of business will be to implement basic quotas throughout the Empire on certain basic needs for both citizen and soldier. Factories will have to learn diversification fast if they wish to survive."
  
  imperial_committee:0 "The Imperial Committee on Civilian Resources"
  imperial_committee_desc:0 "Many advancements in magitech have been hoarded away by independent inventors over the years. While their methods were suspect, and their conclusions filled with heresy, there were still sparks of brilliance in them that they left in their notes. Many of these will be unredacted and provided for perusal of loyal researchers, in order to keep the Empire up-to-date with the rest of Equus."
  
  build_up:0 "Build Up Not Out"
  build_up_desc:0 "To save on further encroaching of precious farmland, new subsidies will be provided to encourage the creation of new hive complexes. These towering skyscrapers will house many ponies as they work for the factories of the megalopolises of the Empire."
  
  reforming_imperial_infrastructure:0 "Reforming the Imperial Infrastructure"
  reforming_imperial_infrastructure_desc:0 "Much of the underlying roads and supply lines of the Solar Empire have not been improved since before the Great War. Patch jobs can only keep the byways and highways usuable for so long before they crumble to dust. New advancements must be found to keep intercity trade flowing."
  
  imperial_innovation:0 "Imperial Innovation"
  imperial_innovation_desc:0 "A careful balance is struck in the Empire between theological orthodoxy and scientific boundary pushing. As of late, the pendulum has been swinging further into the religious camp. Some additional grants to the church universities of Fillydelphia and Manehattan should spur some motivated thinkers to work on new ways to aid the Empress."
  
  imperial_projects:0 "Reassessing Imperial Projects"
  imperial_projects_desc:0 "Despite the last seccession wars with the rump states finished a decade ago, little has been done to improve the underlying weakness in the civilian industry. Much of the funding dedicated from prior years were diverted to Sanctum Solar for unnamed beauty projects. The first step is ending the blight of the citizenry will be rooting out the corrupt officials who snagged this money in the first place."
  
  fueling_fury:0 "Fueling the Fires of Fury"
  fueling_fury_desc:0 "With the initial reforms of the economy finished, and many old guard bureaucrats jobless or lifeless, new initiatives can be instated to motivate additional changes to the economic structure. With new pools of bits for construction of factories, more ponies will be working for the Empress within short order."
  
  bit_reevaluation:0 "Reevaluating the Imperial Bit"
  bit_reevaluation_desc:0 "At the time of Daybreaker's ascension, the Equestrian Bit was the literal gold standard of the continental economy. With the subsequent losses of territory after the peace with the changelings, much of that trust was lost; a single bit then could purchase food worth fifty bits today. Rebasing or retiring the bit is paramount, although what shall replace it remains unseen."
  
  new_imperial_standard:0 "A New Imperial Standard"
  new_imperial_standard_desc:0 "After much deliberation, the Imperial Bit will be retired and replaced with the Imperial Credit. While still nominally tied to the amount of gold in the Empire's coffers, these will only be issued on paper, and will allow for tighter control of the money supply. It only requires that ponies return their bits in exchange of an appropriate amount of credits, which will be easier said than done."
  
  dross_purged:0 "The Dross has been Purged"
  dross_purged_desc:0 "With the reforms to the economy, the Solar Empire's outlook has been improving at a steady rate. Employment has shot through the roof, ponies are investing their new hard-earned credits into the few luxuries available and allowed to them, and revenues have increased across the board. The Empire can look to the future to forge its destiny as an economic superpower once again."
  
  burning_path_through_countryside:0 "Burning Through the Countryside"
  burning_path_through_countryside_desc:0 "The main rail line between Sanctum Solar and Manehattan has seen better days. Like much of the Imperial infrastructure, it has its roots in Equestria, and has not seen much updating since then. Demolishing the old lines and creating new ones are the only way to see improved throughput in travel and supply. Some of the farmers didn't need their land, anyway."
  
  integral_industry:0 "Integral Imperial Industry"
  integral_industry_desc:0 "As much as the Empire relies heavily on its military power and industry, it is the simple pony who works at the factory, or the meagre construction worker who builds the roads that deserve the true recognition. To that end, new subsidies will be established to stimulate further development in the civilian economy, for it will keep the Empire strong."
  
  ###Center Path###
  new_imperial_bureaucracy:0 "A New Imperial Bureaucracy"
  new_imperial_bureaucracy_desc:0 "Much of the lower rungs of the Imperial government is a leftover from when Equestria was ruled by a weak, limp-hoofed leader. These sycophants and bluebloods are nothing but parasites, and cleaning them from Sanctum Solar will speed the creation of future laws."
  
  all_empress_knowledge:0 "All Knowledge Stems from the Empress"
  all_empress_knowledge_desc:0 "For the the benefit of the economy, a new board dedicated to proper Imperial thought will be created. Before its first decree can even be decided, one thing has been made clear: Daybreaker is all-knowing. Wisdom only comes from her. Intellectuals the Empire over would be best to learn it."
  
  citizen_board:0 "A Citizenry Advisory Board"
  citizen_board_desc:0 "Without a strong consumer backbone the Empire will get nowhere.

  in_many_numbers:0 "In Many Numbers Wisdom can be Gleaned"
  in_many_numbers_desc:0 "As much as the Empress does know everything, sometimes the additional experience of other ponies is required. These ponies could temper expectations, or ensure that duties are fulfilled in an efficient and timely manner without straining Daybreaker by requiring she monitor every last detail."
  
  empress_knows_best:0 "Only the Empress Knows Best"
  empress_knows_best_desc:0 "To suggest that anypony other than the God-Empress would know what is the most profitable ventures would be absurd. Creating a position on the board for the Empress whenever she wishes to preside would provide an effective and speedy way to resolve internal conflicts within the board. Nopony would dare question her, after all."
  
  regional_directors:0 "Regional Directors Will Keep the Quotas Up"
  regional_directors_desc:0 "By keeping the basic parts of the Imperial economy decentralized through officers tasked with keeping tally of specific production requirements, the board can focus on avenues that can improve the overall efficiency of production. Through cooperation and synergization, new plants can be directed to switch tasks with little wasted time."
  
  empress_economy:0 "The Empress is the Economy"
  empress_economy_desc:0 "Without her, there is no Solar Empire. Withou her, there is no reason to create the necessary tools to protect ponykind. Giving more power to the position of the Empress over the control of the economy will allow Daybreaker to manage every aspect that she needs to when she needs to. Otherwise the board will be left to its task of keeping the economy chugging."
  
  worker_priority:0 "Priority for the Workers"
  worker_priority_desc:0 "Allowing a few extra factories to focus on some of the minor wants of the blue collar workers will keep them from focusing on their greed and instead on the tasks at hoof. Primarily, this is the increased requirement of raw resources to feed the ever-hungry maw of the Empire's weapons forges."
  
  solaris_priority:0 "All for the Militarium!"
  solaris_priority_desc:0 "As the primary barrier against threats of communists, changelings, and chaotic heretics, the Solaris Militarium must be chosen above all other secular pursuits. Focusing the board on the improvement of infrastructure and supply lines will ease logistics issues, which will always be a welcome relief for the soldiers on the front lines."

  reassessing_commitments_desc:0 "For years, the Empire has propped up some of the remaining businesses that survived the Great War. Many of these still remain floundering, despite the millions of bits that have been poured into them. As of today, those commitments are terminated.

  scour_the_earth_desc:0 "Most of the crystal that is mined in the Empire comes from the Canterhorn Region surrounding Sanctum Solar, but pockets have been discovered over time in the Foal Mountains to the east.

  solar.1.t:0 "Thy Will be Done"
  solar.1.d:0 "Light poured through the simple windows of the room. It was small, square, and sparsely decorated. A basic cot was on one corner, and a small wardrobe filled with cloaks and robes was open. In the center of the room, facing into the sunlight and muttering under her breath, a small white unicorn basked in the warmth of Daybreaker's sun.\n\n"Oh Goddess, hallowed be thy Sun," she began praying aloud. To her, the sunshine coming in the from window wasn't just signifying a new day: it was Harmony and Order itself, cleansing her mind of any impure thoughts and healing her body of any harm caused by the darkness of Night.\n\nShe spread herself out on the floor, prostrate toward the window. "As your Sun purifies the world with its light, so too, let it purify our actions. Forgive us our daily sins and lead us not into heresy. Protect us from the forces of Chaos and Disorder, and strengthen our resolve against the heretic. May the fires of your wrath bring swift destruction to your foes. Give us this day the victory against the enemy!"\n\nSlowly, the unicorn got to her hooves, muttering under her breath, "Thy Empire come, thy will be done, on Equus as it is in Sanctum Solar. Amen."\n\nAurora Shinespark gathered herself and thanked the God-Empress for another day in the Empire. Turning around, she reached out with her orange magic to take her inquisitor's cloak. She fastened the dark red and orange cloak to her back, and she brushed down her dark orange and brown mane.\n\n "Sol Invicta, archmage!" one of the inquisitors cried as she left her room. Aurora returned the greeting and sat down. The rest followed suit.\n\nDuring breakfast, they poured over various letters and documents that had been scattered across the table. Manehattan was a special case in the Empire. As it was the primary production base, the citizens were allowed slightly more freedoms than other cities. The Manehatten chapter was tasked with maintaining Harmony and Order in the city, especially against communist infiltration.\n\n"There is a rally today in Slavation Plaza protesting conditions in the uniform factories," a creamy unicorn with tan spots stated.\n\n "Very well," Aurora answered after taking a bite of food. "Fidelis Flamma and Novus Flux! Attend the protest and ensure that no heretics provoke a riot." She turned back to the first pony. "Is there any news on the potential Harmonist terrorist cell?"\n\n"No, archmage," the inquisitor replied. "The Speculatores have returned no new information. The corruption grows deeper, but they are unable to find the source."\n\n"Worrisome," Aurora murmured. Before she could continue, the door to the chapter house opened and a messenger arrived, out of breath from a long travel. "Speak," she barked.\n\n"Aurora Shinespark," he began, gathering as much pomp as he could muster. "You have been summoned to Sanctum Solar. The Empress wishes to speak with you concerning grave matters. You will depart for the holy city at once.""
  solar.1.a:0 "What does the Empress require of me?"
  solar.2.t:0 "Heresy Abounds"
  solar.2.d:0 ""What does the Empress require of me?" Aurora pondered as she approached the entrance to Daybreaker's throne room. Guards of the Solaris Militarium roved the halls, their hooves clanking on the exposed stonework.\n\nFlanking her on either side were a pair of inquisitors, their harsh glares making her feel like she was on trial for heresy. As they creaked open the massive bolted doors, they announced her presence. Waves of heat hit her, instantly causing her to break out into a sweat.\n\nAt the far end of the room, easily a hundred feet distant, the God-Empress sat on her throne, unmoving and watching Aurora with brown and yellow cat-like eyes. She looked to the two guards stationed either side the steps to her throne. "Leave us," she stated and her guards instantly obeyed.\n\nAurora prostrated herself on the marble floor, waiting for Daybreaker's stern yet soft command to rise. When she did, she briefly met the Empress's gaze, but she quickly averted her eyes. It was like Daybreaker could see every thought Aurora had.\n\nClicking her tongue, Daybreaker turned Aurora's face back toward her and she stated in a soothing voice, "Fear not, Aurora. I have a task for you." She smiled and faced the great bay window overlooking the spires and towers of Sanctum Solar.\n\nAurora gulped as she observed Daybreaker. Her armor glittered in her sun, the orange and gold reflecting sharply back into Aurora's eyes. As she approached, Daybreaker snarled and growled, "I have sacrificed much to protect Harmony and Order in MY Empire, and yet my own generals repay me with heresy!" Her mane pulsed a few flashes of violent purple and blue before returning to its normal orange.\n\nHer brow crinkled in anger, she stomped a hoof on the ground and barked, "You are the first of a few inquisitors that will be tasked with rooting out this heresy once and for all!" Holding up a hoof, she added, "But first, you will be dispatched to Trotsville."\n\nAs Aurora tilted her head in confusion, Daybreaker ruffled her wings and she stated, "The Solaris Speculatores has discovered it has ben harboring heretics for months. They were offered mercy, to turn over their vermin, but refused. Punish them by Holy Fire, for it is the only solution to Chaos."\n\nWalking past Aurora, she settled back down on her throne and waved a hoof dismissively. "When you return, you can deal with the heretics in the Militarium. For now, Trotsville is your target. May the Fires of My Sun aid you, Archmage."\n\nBowing, Aurora replied, "The Holy Flame shall guide me." She quickly departed, her first thought the need for a shower."
  solar.2.a:0 "I shall not fail you, my Empress!"
  solar.3.t:0 "Rooting Out Corruption"
  solar.3.d:0 "Thunderbolt Sentinel observed the small hamlet of Trotsville from the skies. "It's just part of the job," he thought, taking a deep breath and fighting back the growing lump in his stomach that was trying to move its way up his throat.\n\n"I suppose it was going to catch up to me at some point," he mused to himself, looking back at the archmage. Aurora Shinespark, or some such, Daybreaker's inquisitor to ensure he stayed loyal. They all sounded alike. All looked similar, too. She noticed the older stallion watching her and returned it with a stern glare. Shuddering, he turned back to look at the approaching hamlet. He could sense the piercing golden eyes of the archmage still focused on him.\n\nSighing, he turned and faced Aurora. Her white fur stood out against the deep oranges and reds of her cloak, and ornate rings decorated her horn. After a moment of silence, the two eying each other cautiously, he finally asked, "How do you it?"\n\nHer expression remained unchanged, and she spoke in the condescending manner as a mother would with a wayward foal. "It is a simple decision. Harmonist agitators were discovered and the citizens refused to arrest them. The Empress has decreed that—"\n\n"Yes, that all those who do not abide by true Harmony and Order are heretics." Thunderbolt finished, trying hard not to derisively spitting out the last word. "My question is: how do you condemn innocent ponies to die?"\n\nShaking her head, her deep orange mane swaying with the motion, she said, "Would you not sacrifice a few thousand innocents for the salvation of millions more? If heresy is not stamped out at the roots where it grows, it will spread to other towns. It will then spread to the cities, before reaching Sanctum Solar itself."\n\nWith a scowl, she got within inches of Thunderbolt's face. Fire as bright as the Empress' Sun shone in her eyes as she continued, "This decision is never done lightly, and I pray the souls of those who are truly loyal to the Empress will find peace in the next life."\n\nShe motioned at the pilot, who opened the bombardier doors. Below, the small houses of Trotsville began to zoom past, a few specks visible to Thunderbolt: ponies going about their day without any idea of what was going to happen.\n\n"Do not look away, Thunderbolt Sentinel. Remember the price of heresy." Aurora cantered past the general and observed out the cockpit window as the squadron unleashed their payloads on the hamlet below.\n\nThere was a bright flash, and soon heat began to assault his face. Flames began spreading across the streets of Trotsville and the screams of those who were unfortunate enough to be caught in the napalm blast reached his ears. Whether out of fear or regret, he could not say, he watched as flames engulfed the hamlet. The price of heresy. The price of challenging Daybreaker's rule."

  ###Scripted GUIs###
  quasar_pulse_first_greeting:0 "Ah, Princess Regent. Don't mind Snuggles, he doesn't bite. Often. *chuckles*"
  quasar_pulse_first_offer:0 "You come to me for support of Archmage Shinespark? I'm more than willing to vote for her, so long as she can promise additional resources in the fight against heresy."
  quasar_pulse_rejection:0 "Do not look to me when a heretic stabs you in the back."
  quasar_pulse_second_greeting:0 "You've come back, have you?"
  quasar_pulse_second_offer:0 "The offer still stands. You need me to support Archmage Shinespark, I need more funds for purging heresy. It is only for heresy, I assure you."
  quasar_pulse_acceptance:0 "Excellent! I told you she'd agree, Snuggles. Very well, I look forward to what your new High Mage will do. Hopefully she doesn't get... crushed by the responsibility. *snickers*"
  quasar_pulse_acceptance_assurance:0 "Don't worry, Princess Regent. I would never go back on my word. Snuggles makes sure of it."
  blueblood_first_greeting:0 "Sunset. What an absolute PLEASURE to see you. Do you have to bother me so?" 
  blueblood_first_offer:0 "You want me to vote for who? Ugh, fine, I can support this Sparkshine pony or whoever. So long as you let me prototype some of my new military theories."
  blueblood_rejection:0 "You've always had it out for me, Shimmer! See where the Empire stands in a year without MY ideas! It'll be nothing but a pile of rubble!"
  blueblood_second_greeting:0 "What do you want now, Sunset?"
  blueblood_second_offer:0 "Oh, of all the- Fine! I'll vote for your little bitch of a priestess if you leave the Militarium alone. I need the solitude to perfect my genius strategies."
  blueblood_acceptance:0 "I see you've finally fallen for my devilish charms, yes? \"No?!\" What do you mean \"no?\""
  blueblood_acceptance_assurance:0 "Do you not trust me to at least stick to my word, Sunset? Typical." #In case the player goes back after agreeing to support the voter
  seething_corona_first_greeting:0 "Sol Invictus, Princess Regent!"
  seething_corona_first_offer:0 "I've not heard much of Archmage Shinespark, but you wish for me to vote for her? Perhaps, so long as we can come to an... agreement. Considering I'm in charge of Ordo Solis, I'm not given the respect running Sanctum Solar is due. Perhaps you could fix that?"
  seething_corona_rejection:0 "I knew it! I'm surrounded by ingrates!"
  seething_corona_second_greeting:0 "Hello, Princess Regent."
  seething_corona_second_offer:0 "Not gotten enough support, I see. I suppose I have to forgive the slight you put on my honor. So long as Ordo Solis is acknowledged as the prime Ordo, then yes, I'll vote for Archmage Shinespark."
  seething_corona_acceptance:0 "*cackles* Yes! I can finally rub it in Pulsar Sweep's face! So long as she doesn't become High Mage, I suppose."
  seething_corona_acceptance_assurance:0 "*giggles* I can't wait to see Pulsar Sweep's expression when I come in- Hmm? Yes, I'm still voting for Archmage Shinespark. Not to worry."
  steel_sickle_first_greeting:0 "Greetings, Princess Regent Shimmer. What have you come to ask?"
  steel_sickle_first_offer:0 "Give me more tools for the farmlands. Like it or not, Ponyville and its region still provide most of the food for the Empire, after SOMEPONY drove the neighbors down south away. We can only do so much. Get me more, and I'll vote for Archmage Shinespark."
  steel_sickle_rejection:0 "You'd really let the Empire starve to save on some bits now? I pray that the Empress gives you wisdom."
  steel_sickle_rejection_alternate:0 "You've pledged money to that luddite, Iron Tail but not to me?! Are you mad?! Do you WANT to see the Empire starve?!"
  steel_sickle_second_greeting:0 "Have you reconsidered my offer?"
  steel_sickle_second_offer:0 "*mumbles* I should have been made Regent. *louder* The Empire needs more food. Ordo Messis provides most of it, and we require new and better tools to eke greater yields. Earmark a supply of them, and I'll vote for Archmage Shinespark."
  steel_sickle_second_offer_alternate:0 "*grunts* Empress give me patience. *louder* If you have any sense-although you don't since you supported Iron Tail-you'd provide funding for my farmers to make more food. Please tell me you have a LITTLE in that skull of yours."
  steel_sickle_acceptance:0 "The Empress will be pleased with your wisdom, Princess Regent. Archmage Shinespark has my support."
  steel_sickle_acceptance_alternate:0 "At least you came around in the end. I will vote for Archmage Shinespark."
  steel_sickle_acceptance_assurance:0 "Yes, Archmage Shinespark still has my vote. Please stop pestering me."
  ion_trail_first_greeting:0 "Praise the Empress! How can I assist you, Princess Regent?"
  ion_trail_first_offer:0 "I can vote for Archmage Shinespark, but I have my own troubles to worry about. Ordo Marris is currently experiencing a large uptick in heresy. I could consider Archmage Shinespark's merits if I had additional troops to search the seaboard while I'm here in Sanctum Solar."
  ion_trail_rejection:0 "I suppose you don't need my help after all. Perhaps Pulsar Sweep is more amenable."
  ion_trail_second_greeting:0 "Hello again, Princess Regent. Done some thinking, have we?"
  ion_trail_second_offer:0 "Archmage Shinespark has been on my mind as of late. She was the one who found the heresy in the Militarium, no? Surely she would understand if you spared a few troops to aid another struggling Ordo, yes?"
  ion_trail_acceptance:0 "Consider Archmage Shinespark as good as HIGH-ered. Hah! I crack myself up some days."
  ion_trail_acceptance_assurance:0 "Archmage Shinespark is MAGE-orly supported by me, Princess Regent. Oh, Daybreaker, I'm really too good some days."
  iron_tail_first_greeting:0 "Yes? Oh, Princess Regent. What can I do for you?"
  iron_tail_first_offer:0 "The demands of the war forges have not gotten any less intense, but many of my ponies are working with pickaxes nearly rubbed to the nub. If you give me funding for purchasing new equipment, then consider me on board for supporting Archmage Shinespark."
  iron_tail_rejection:0 "When you run out of guns, you'll remember this day!"
  iron_tail_rejection_alternate:0 "You are fine supporting Steel Sickle's little biological tests, but you can't find funding for something practical?! Are you joking?!" #For if you support Steel Sickle before talking to Iron Tail
  iron_tail_second_greeting:0 "Have you come to reject me again?"
  iron_tail_second_offer:0 "Yes, I still need new tools. Pickaxes, industrial sluicers, explosives, you name it. I will vote for Archmage Shinespark, so long as you give me financial support."
  iron_tail_second_offer_alternate:0 "Are you going to be consistent now? Give me funding like you did with that wench, Steel Sickle, and Ordo Meurom will support Archmage Shinespark."
  iron_tail_acceptance:0 "Good! It was a pleasure doing business with you, Princess Regent."
  iron_tail_acceptance_alternate:0 "At least you came around in the end. You hear that, Sickle?! You aren't the only one who gets bits for \"honest\" work!"
  iron_tail_acceptance_assurance:0 "Don't worry, Princess Regent, Archmage Shinespark will be sitting in your former quarters in no time."
  burning_plage_first_greeting:0 "Oh! Princess Regent! What do you want to see me for?"
  burning_plage_first_offer:0 "You'd want me to support Aurora's bid for High Mage? Nopony ever seeks input from Ordo Silva. I... can't just do it for free, unfortunately. There's a lot of undeveloped land in my Ordo, and many ponies are homeless after a skirmish with Bales. Perhaps if some of our industry was diverted to construct new homes, I could pledge my support."
  burning_plage_rejection:0 "I understand. Ordo Silva isn't very important. I guess I'll have to find a way to house these ponies another way."
  burning_plage_second_greeting:0 "Princess Regent! I'm surprised you returned."
  burning_plage_second_offer:0 "*chuckles* Snuggles is a bit of a character, isn't he? *sighs* My offer is still open. But if you still don't want to alter our nation's industrial planning, I understand. But if you want me to vote for Aurora, then I need you to promise that these ponies will be given new homes. Is that possible?"
  burning_plage_acceptance:0 "R-Really?! You'll do it? Oh, okay then. I'll vote for Aurora. Thank you, Princess Regent!"
  burning_plage_acceptance_assurance:0 "Thank you again, Princess Regent. Aurora has my support. I was thinking about it anyway, to be honest."
  sunset_quasar_first_greeting:0 "Hello, Quasar. You've worked with Archmage Shinespark before. Would you support her bid to become High Mage?"
  sunset_quasar_second_greeting:0 "Yes, I've come back."
  sunset_quasar_acceptance:0 "I don't have much choice, do I? You'll get your funding, although I don't know what in Daybreaker's name you do with it."
  sunset_quasar_rejection:0 "No! The Inquisitionis has yielded no further results with all of your allocations! I have to draw the line somewhere."
  sunset_blueblood_first_greeting:0 "Blueblood. I trust you're feeling appropriately gorged today? I won't waste your time. Will you vote for Aurora Shinespark?"
  sunset_blueblood_second_greeting:0 "Obviously to tell you how much of an ass you are. I need your support. Unfortunately."
  sunset_blueblood_acceptance:0 "Why do I have the feeling that the entire city will be in ruins by next Tuesday?"
  sunset_blueblood_rejection:0 "You'll level the entire country in a week. Absolutely not."
  sunset_corona_first_greeting:0 "Sol Invictus, Archmage Corona. Would you be willing to support Archmage Shinespark to become the new High Mage?"
  sunset_corona_second_greeting:0 "Archmage Corona. I still need your support."
  sunset_corona_acceptance:0 "So long as you don't use your new perks as an excuse to use up all the champagne in Sanctum Solar, then fine."
  sunset_corona_rejection:0 "All the Ordos are equal, I don't see what your problem is. Denied."
  sunset_steel_first_greeting:0 "I need your assistance, Archmage Sickle. Archmage Shinespark is better suited than Archmage Sweep for High Mage. You must vote for her."
  sunset_steel_second_greeting:0 "I need to hear it again. What did you need?"
  sunset_steel_acceptance:0 "It's a small price to pay for the Empire's survival. Very well."
  sunset_steel_rejection:0 "I've heard of some of your experiments you run in the fields. Cabbage floss? Broccoli balls? You'll use the funding for more of those, not actual farming. No."
  sunset_ion_first_greeting:0 "You can aid me by voting for Archmage Shinespark."
  sunset_ion_second_greeting:0 "Yes, you could say that."
  sunset_ion_acceptance:0 "Why did you not inform us earlier of the growing heresy? Of course I'll allocate some additonal soldiers."
  sunset_ion_rejection:0 "Ordo Marris already has the largest contingent of soldiers out of all the Ordos. You do not need more. What are you doing? Sending them into the Celestial Sea?"
  sunset_iron_first_greeting:0 "I'll be brief. I need your vote for Aurora Shinespark."
  sunset_iron_second_greeting:0 "I've come to consider your offer again, yes. I've yet to make up my mind."
  sunset_iron_acceptance:0 "We always need more weapons for protecting the Empire, especially now without the Empress guiding us. You will get your bits."
  sunset_iron_acceptance_alternate:0 "You're right. I was being hypocritical. The bits are yours."
  sunset_iron_rejection:0 "As much as I'd like to, the Empire isn't made of money. You'll have to make do with what you have."
  sunset_burning_first_greeting:0 "Hello, Plage. I need your help. You could stand between the Empire becoming worse for living in or experiencing a new golden age. Please vote for Archmage Shinespark."
  sunset_burning_second_greeting:0 "It's because you have a pleasant demeanor. I mean that literally. I swear Archmage Pulse's snake is planning how to smother me in my sleep."
  sunset_burning_acceptance:0 "The Empress has unlimited mercy! Of course we'll help get these ponies back on their hooves."
  sunset_burning_rejection:0 "I wish I could, but everything is running at full capacity, and I can't retool entire lines for weeks without disrupting other consumer goods. I'm truly sorry."
  aurora_greeting:0 "*She looks visibly nervous* Hello, Sunset."
  aurora_conversation:0 "Do I need to state the obvious? You put me forward as a candidate instead of Archmage Sweep! Of course I'm going to look uneasy, she's one of the favorites of everypony here. You should see how frequently the rest of the archmages gush about her when the Ordos convene."
  aurora_conversation_second:0 "*In a slightly deriding tone* \"Oh, Archmage Sweep, how did you dispose of the heresy so quickly?\" \"If we were allowed to marry, I'd want you to have my foals!\" Ugh, that last one makes me want to vomit. How did we get a stallion as an archmage, again?"
  aurora_conversation_third:0 "Right. Hard to believe that Fundamentum was the best option. Anyway, my point stands that everypony here won't be voting for me. I'm honored that you thought me worthy, Sunset, but the Primus has their eyes on another pony."
  aurora_conversation_leave:0 "I pray to you're right. Quasar especially is a viper in a pony's body. Don't trust her."
  aurora_refusal_to_talk:0 "Sorry, Sunset. I'd rather collect my thoughts, right now. Let me know what the Primus decides when they've finished their horn measuring contest."
  aurora_question:0 "Well? What are the results?"
  aurora_pleased:0 "That is... surprising. I thought that the Adoratio Primus would shoo in Archmage Sweep. I suppose there's more cunning in you than it appears."
  aurora_displeased:0 "I'm not surprised. Archmage Sweep is seen as more orthodox, even compared to me or Archmage Sickle. You did your best, Sunset. Thank you. I'll keep in touch."
  sunset_good_results:0 "It took a lot of begging, bribing, and stealing, but you are now the new High Mage! Sol Invictus, Aurora. I will speak with you tomorrow morning."
  sunset_bad_results:0 "I... wish I could bear good news. Pulsar Sweep is the new High Mage. I'm sorry. I did my best, but everypony wanted something in return, and I couldn't cripple the Empire further. Best of luck in Manehattan, my friend."
  sunset_aurora_greeting:0 "You seem troubled. What's wrong?"
  sunset_aurora_second_conversation:0 "Fundamentum Lucis was one of three candidates. Ebriacus Vinum passed out in a pool of her own bile and Lymphatus Cultro threatened the voters with a pair of shivs. Fundamentum just showed up and acted normal."
  sunset_aurora_departure:0 "You'll be surprised, Aurora. Ponies may be willing to change their mind. After all, I have the full weight of the Empress's authority behind me now."
  sunset_pulsar_greeting:0 "Archmage Sweep. You seem rather sure of yourself."
  sunset_pulsar_departure:0 "Personally, Pulsar, I wouldn't discount Aurora yet. She has some powerful influence, if you know what I mean."
  sunset_pulsar_departure_alternate_first:0 "No, not a problem at all, Pulsar. After all, you're more than qualified, since you've had no issues at all with Ordo Apparatus." #Alternate line to be a bit more snide with Pulsar
  sunset_pulsar_departure_alternate_second:0 "Except, didn't you have a time when you were flogged by a few heretics? I'm sure those skills at embarrassment will go far as High Mage. *snickers*"
  sunset_pulsar_departure_alternate_third:0 "They did call me the Alpha Bitch when I was younger for a reason. It's nothing personal, Pulsar. Aurora would simply be a better fit."
  pulsar_greeting:0 "A pleasure to see you, Princess Regent. It truly is marvelous seeing the best of the Empress debating away, isn't it? Well, aside from Blueblood. If only that oaf Horizon Sunrise was here instead."
  pulsar_conversation:0 "*laughs* But of course. I have nothing against Archmage Shinespark, but the Empire needs somepony with more years of experience than her to lead the Adoratio and Inquistionis. Everypony here already knows that."
  pulsar_conversation_second:0 "*She gives a slightly mocking pout* It'd be shameful if somepony of Archmage Shinespark's caliber were to be the new High Mage, wouldn't you think? The role needs more stability than what Ordo Multi has experienced these last couple of years."
  pulsar_conversation_third:0 "*She shrugs* Ah well, forgive me for taking up your time, Princess Regent. I look forward to our collaberation once the Adoratio Primus has cast its vote."
  pulsar_leave:0 "*huffs* I wouldn't think you to be so petty, Princess Regent. If you... convince others to elect her, you're making a grave mistake."
  pulsar_leave_alternate_first:0 "I wasn't expecting that, what with your pet that you made trying to save the Empress and all. Do you truly believe that?"
  pulsar_leave_alternate_second:0 "*She frowns and snorts* A joke, of course. Well, Princes Regent, I hope you are more mature outside the voting room."
  pulsar_leave_alternate_third:0 "*Smacks a hoof to her face* Empress, I fear for the Empire's survival."

  ###Scripted GUIs Daybreaker's meeting with Luna###
  palace_dungeons_title:0 "Sanctum Solar Catacombs"
  dungeon_description:0 "*The walls are crumbling after hundreds of years of disuse and drips of water are audible from many different directions. Nopony has had reason to enter, save for now. Ahead is a single locked cell, and inside is a familiar form, which stirs when approached.*"
  luna_awaken:0 "*snorts and coughs as she gets to a sitting position* Who is there? Stay back! Even in my weakend state, I can still-*Her eyes widen* It's you. Have you come to mock me yet again? I would say \"fair sister,\" but you are not fair nor my sister."
  daybreaker_opening:0 "*cackles* If that is what you wish, little Luna, then I will be happy to oblige."
  luna_annoyed:0 "For what do you wish to see me? Is it not sufficient enough that my sister is gone, the Crystal Empire humiliated, and you reign over it all? Must you still taunt me to this day? *she looks away* I need not more reminders of my failure."
  daybreaker_titillated:0 "I could rub all of those in your muzzle whenever I wish. No, I'm not here to do any of that, I'm just here to watch. To gloat. A bit of big sister teasing. *chortles*"
  luna_resigned_to_mockery:0 "Is this to be the punishment for Us? To verily live the rest of Our-my years in captivity? Please, just end me."
  daybreaker_solution:0 "Oh, that is exactly what I intend to do." #Only choose this if you're boring.
  luna_frightened:0 "What? Thou wouldst not!"
  daybreaker_overjoyed_at_killing:0 "Why wouldst I not? Thou art too much of a threat to Our-Ugh, how do you even speak like that?"
  daybreaker_no_longer_flowery:0 "Like, seriously, it's just so... old! I can't believe you and Celestia spoke that way at one point. Spinstery, if you ask me."
  luna_missed_joke:0 "You art truly a comedian, wench."
  daybreaker_chiding:0 "Now, is that any way to speak to your big sister? I'll just have to make sure your punishment is suitable. How does execution by fire sound? I think it'll make you nice and toasty around this time of year."
  luna_scared_at_end:0 "Truly my sister must be dead! How else could a monster have possessed her so? Very well, I shall meet my fate with the dignity that befits my position. You will not gain any more satisfaction from defeating me, Daybreaker."
  daybreaker_mockingly_sad:0 "Aw, and I was hoping you'd beg. Tsk, I figured as much. You shall join the others in their fate. Goodbye, sister. May we never meet again."
  daybreaker_denying:0 "Now why would I want my dearest, long-lost sister to be killed? Where's the fun in that? We missed so many things that we could have done together, Lulu."
  luna_teased:0 "Do not speaketh to Us in such a way, foul viper! Thou hast not proven thyself to be Our sister in any way! Thou art the scum that We wouldst scrapeth from Our shoe!" #Fun, introspective path
  daybreaker_mockingly_dismayed:0 "Luna! Watch your language! Don't speak to your sister like that!"
  daybreaker_having_fun:0 "Especially after she's helped keep the ponies of Equestria safe. Well... relatively, anyway. *chuckles*"
  luna_done_with_daybreakers_crap:0 "Keep Our ponies \"SAFE?!\" *she kicks at the bars* Art thou mad? *she quiets down* Of course. What were We thinking? That answer is but a short distance from Our muzzle."
  luna_morbidly_curious:0 "*she is silent for a moment* How do you keep them \"safe?\" Dost thou... do you really believe all you've done for them is right?"
  daybreaker_captain_obvious:0 "Of course, sister."
  luna_does_not_want:0 "*scowls* Please, enlighten Us."
  daybreaker_is_best_first:0 "You wish me to monologue? *chuckles* I've not monologued in... oh, at least thirty years!"
  daybreaker_is_best_second:0 "Harmony failed, Lulu. The only way that it survived at all was me injecting Order into it. Celestia saw this as Stalliongrad marched on our lands, and it gave her the strength to carry on, for a time. Until she needed me."
  daybreaker_is_best_third:0 "Its ways are antiquated, naive. This world is too harsh and unforgiving to live without a solid dose of reality."
  luna_unsure:0 "*appears annoyed* And that reality is?"
  daybreaker_captain_obvious_part_deux:0 "The kind, the caring, get trampled over. If anypony is to live, they must have the mettle to willingly give up themselves to a greater purpose. My purpose. A path of Order and peace. I've almost achieved it. It only took longer because ponies resisted."
  luna_noes:0 "Thou art mad! Harmony gives ponies the freedom to live, to be themselves! Thou hast established a regime of oppression and loss!"
  daybreaker_ironic:0 "Oh, I'm mad, for sure. And that anger pushes me to go on. Soon, the changelings and Marelandia will be punished, and the world will be right once more, sister."
  luna_snaps:0 "DO NOT REFER TO US AS BLOOD, DUPLICITOUS SWINE!"
  daybreaker_condescending:0 "I am as much your sister as Celestia was, SISTER."
  luna_confused:0 "*visibly confused* What dost thou mean?"
  daybreaker_monologue_first:0 "Do you not sometimes feel it, Luna? The rage? The anger? The sadness? How they swell up, and then suddenly disappear? Surely, you can feel HER, inside of you, absorbing it. Oh, I know you can."
  daybreaker_monologue_second:0 "Obviously, I speak of Nightmare Moon. She is just as much my sister as she was Celestia's. Different ponies, but the same body. When I say that I'm your sister, Luna. I mean it. In every sense of the word. But I'm not Celestia. I'm far, far greater."
  daybreaker_monologue_third:0 "And prettier. *cackles*"
  luna_what:0 "No, Nightmare Moon was all that I was not. All the rejection I felt, I fed into-"
  daybreaker_pleased:0 "Yes, an alter-ego. What do you think I was for Celestia? She felt guilty, angry, and most importantly, lonely after you were gone. Where do you think that ended up? Me."
  luna_doh:0 "That is obvious. But even when I was lost to my madness, I was still in control. Nightmare Moon never-"
  daybreaker_tired:0 "Oh, Nightmare Moon was only toying with you. From what I learned after the fact, she was one to play games too much. It cost her everything. You hear that, Moony? You were too much of a manipulator!"
  luna_confused_again:0 "Who are you addressing?"
  daybreaker_mocking:0 "Our other dear sister, of course. An alicorn's mind is too strong to have only broken aspects of a psyche. Nightmare Moon is seeing everything, I assure you."
  luna_still_confused:0 "You speak as if it were-"
  daybreaker_goading:0 "Two separate ponies? Yes. Honestly, you should let her out more often. The black fits your dark and dreary attitude so much better."
  daybreaker_revealing:0 "Tell me, do you remember what you did in Celestia's presence after Starlight left? After she first revealed to Celestia that I existed?"
  luna_unsure_again:0 "I... wished her a farewell and a safe trip and then saw her off with you."
  daybreaker_pity:0 "Ugh, you were doing so well. No, you also flipped her the bird and called her a quote \"meddling dalcop\" that nearly \"gobermouched\" her way into casting Equestria into ruin. Oh, you also referred to her as a \"yaldmare.\""
  luna_embarrassed:0 "*blushes violently* I-I... how did you know? You can't have had heard that!"
  daybreaker_pity_some_more:0 "It's a wonder what one can see when they aren't watching what their host observes."
  luna_bemused:0 "I still do not believe you. And if that is the case, then Celestia is in there somewhere and-"
  daybreaker_deadpan:0 "Celestia is dead."
  luna_wha:0 "*stares blankly, then tears start to trickle down* W-What?! She cannot-!"
  daybreaker_done:0 "Search your feelings, sister. You know that it is true. I will leave you to ruminate. After all, we have plenty of time to catch up. *cackles*"
  luna_why:0 "N-No, that cannot be... I... Celestia could not..."
  depart_scene:0 "*Leave without saying a word*"
  daybreaker_return:0 "Oh, Luna! How is my FAVORITE sister doing?"
  luna_bored:0 "We have nothing to say to thee, knave!"
  daybreaker_insulted:0 "Pfft, like you have any choice."
  luna_bored_again:0 "*she glares harshly* So you say."
  daybreaker_prodding:0 "Have you had time to think on what I've said?"
  luna_no:0 "We will not discuss any of thine nonsense any further! Either end Us or leave Us be! *she turns around and ignores any further attempts to talk*"
  daybreaker_ticked:0 "Tsk, fine. You always were such a drag."
  adios_luna:0 "*Depart in silence.*"
  luna_refuses_to_talk:0 "*Luna is refusing to speak further at this time. She appears despondent.*"
  ###Meeting after Changelings###
  arrival_part_deux:0 "*Dim light filters through some of the barred windows of the rusted cells. They paint a thin path toward Luna.*"
  luna_angry:0 "*Luna glowers out the iron bars of the dungeon cell. She remains silent.*"
  daybreaker_gleeful:0 "Hello, sister. I have-"
  luna_you_what_bitch:0 "Do NOT call Us thine sister, dollop!"
  daybreaker_really:0 "Ugh, I really need to get your mouth cleaned sometime, sister."
  daybreaker_ignoring:0 "But I'm in a good mood today. Would you like to know why?"
  luna_bemused_deux:0 "We have a feeling that thou shalt inform us regardless."
  daybreaker_chortle:0 "*chuckles* But of course, for how could I keep this from you. I have enacted the Empire's vengeance of the changeling threat. Their queen is no more."
  luna_doesnt_care:0 "Hmm, how lovely. *she crosses her hooves and glares further*"
  daybreaker_annoyed:0 "You seriously don't want to know how it was done? What I had to sacrifice for ponykind's salvation?"
  luna_irritated:0 "Verily, We couldn't care less what thine armies achieved. It is for naught if the ponies of Equestria live under merely a different iron hoof."
  daybreaker_laughing:0 "Posh, Luna. I don't sap them for love or other emotions. Against their will, anyway. All I ask is for devotion to a cause. Mine. *cackles*"
  luna_scoffing:0 "Ah, so they are merely exchanging one harsh rule for another. We see that our statement is true."
  daybreaker_ticked_off:0 "Everything I do is for the benefit of the ponies under my rule! If it weren't for me, Equestria would be DEAD!"
  luna_deadpan:0 "It is already perished. Thou hast made sure of that."
  daybreaker_disappointed:0 "Luna, Luna, Luna. Always so quick to judgement."
  luna_interrupting:0 "We believe thou art what is called... projecting. *she gives the faintest wry smile*"
  daybreaker_outraged:0 "SILENCE!"
  luna_wut:0 "*She stares in shock*"
  daybreaker_regained_composure:0 "As I was saying. Everything I've done has been for my ponies benefit. They have stability, order, and most of all, harmony."
  luna_sigh:0 "If this is what thou believist to be harmony, then thou hast to look for a new dictionary."
  daybreaker_bruh:0 "Luna, I want to keep everything safe. For everypony."
  daybreaker_sigh:0 "*sighs* You are still my little sister, I only wish you would see the errors you are making."
  luna_are_you_serious:0 "gazes in surprise, although she starts to scowl*"
  luna_WTF:0 "Art thou mad?! Thou admittest to killing Our own SISTER and you believe thou canst simply traipse into Our prison and regard us as FAMILY?!"
  daybreaker_shocked:0 "I-"
  luna_no_way:0 "Thou only share one aspect of Celestia. You share her delusions of unity. We will never see thee as Our sister."
  daybreaker_wait:0 "But I-"
  luna_leave:0 "Leave Us, before We attempt to test the limit of Our confines. Do you wish to drive thy dear \"sister\" to death?"
  daybreaker_oh:0 "I shall go."
  luna_bye_bitch:0 "We wish thine overweight rump would depart faster!"
  end_scene:0 "I suppose I will."
  ###Meeting after Marelandia###
  arrival_the_third:0 "*For once the sunlight has radiated into the catacombs. Long shafts of yellow pierce through some of the shadowy haze and reflect off pools of water. They illuminate Luna.*"
  luna_starving:0 "*Luna doesn't stir. She remains curled on the floor and staring out the cell doors. Her ribs are visible through her fur.*"
  luna_still_angy:0 "After a moment, she coughs and sits up. The familiar scowl from previous interactions is on her muzzle.*"
  ew_rotten:0 "*There is a plate of slightly moldy food sitting beside Luna.*"
  daybreaker_concerned:0 "Surely you must be hungry, Luna? What kind of sister would I be if I didn't-"
  luna_tiredly_pissed:0 "We request, AGAIN, that thou cease referring to Us as thine sister."
  daybreaker_no:0 "Now, Luna, you mustn't be so cranky. It's probably because you haven't eaten well. You could try some of what's next to you. It looks palatable... mostly."
  luna_bruh:0 "What dost thou intend to speak to Us regarding this time? *she lays back down and gazes off into the distance* We can see thou art excited about something."
  luna_bitchy:0 "*a wry smile forms on her muzzle* Mayhap thou hast finally had a good night's rest? Or dost thou instead merely prey on thy ponies' blood for energy?"
  daybreaker_enough:0 "*sigh* For once, could you speak, NORMALLY?!"
  luna_surprised:0 "*she blinks a couple of times* Fine, Daybreaker. It was getting boring anyway. You could have at least played along for a short while. *she huffs and rolls her eyes*"
  daybreaker_annoyed_again:0 "You'd almost think that you were trapped in time for a millennium."
  luna_quiet:0 "*Luna says nothing*"
  daybreaker_conversational:0 "I suppose I could share what's gotten me so excited... Luna. Marelandia is finally gone! Squished, like the vermin they were! *cackle*"
  daybreaker_excited:0 "The Inquisitionis has its work cut out for it! Oh, I can hear the screams of MARESOC now as they're set upon a pyre! With a little poof, they'll be out of our mane forever!"
  luna_unenthused:0 "It seems then you've gotten everything you've wanted, didn't you?"
  daybreaker_orly:0 "Not just me, sister! Don't be so pouty, you know Mother always hated your moodiness!"
  luna_eyeroll:0 "*Luna rolls her eyes again*"
  daybreaker_mothering:0 "You'll make your eyes fall right out if you do that! Jeez, I'm sounding like Mother now."
  luna_get_to_the_point:0 "What do you want?!"
  daybreaker_tsk:0 "Our ponies are safe again! No more communists, no more damned changelings. Well, aside from the ones forced to repair all the damage they did in the war."
  daybreaker_ranting:0 "In only a few years, I've regained all the land that was lost do those cursed insects! They've been brought to their knees! Everypony FEARS the name of Daybreaker Sun, for I am the light that exacts vengeance for my ponies' suffering!"
  daybreaker_going_ham:0 "The Marelandians are DEAD. Mareland is now part of the Empire! Peace has been restored. Prosperity is on the horizon! Justice has been SERVED! *cackle*"
  daybreaker_oblivious:0 "Do you not see, Luna?! I have done all this to save my, OUR ponies! The wars are over, the day has been won. I'VE brought order to the Equus, to the world!"
  daybreaker_still_talking:0 "Celestia was weak! I have perfected her! She may be gone, but I've risen like a phoenix from her ashes. The griffons and their backward continent know that Daybreaker Sun will protect her ponies! Nothing will harm any of us ever again!"
  daybreaker_realized:0 "This is a new - Luna?"
  luna_bored_more:0 "*Luna is still staring into the distance. She barely registers anything.*"
  luna_distracted:0 "Hmm? Were you telling me something of interest?"
  daybreaker_worried:0 "Were you not listening to me at all? You never listened to me! Not once since-No, the time for anger is over."
  daybreaker_trying_to_be_kind:0 "I was explaining - and if you didn't have your ears full of wax, you could hear - how the Empire has been established for eternity. Nopony could ever hope to threaten-"
  luna_ok_bitch:0 "That is nice, Daybreaker. I wish you luck in ruling your new Empire. *she yawns and lies down*"
  daybreaker_what:0 "...Are you not going to eat your food, at least?"
  luna_ho_hum:0 "I am not hungry, sister."
  daybreaker_more_concerned:0 "Do not lie to me, Luna! I am your-"
  luna_shut_up:0 "Yes. My sister. *she waves a hoof dismissively* Perhaps tomorrow. I am tired. I am cold. I wish to sleep."
  daybreaker_you_sure:0 "Luna, I am asking you to keep-"
  luna_seriously_shut:0 "I do not wish to speak longer, sister. I'm sure I must be stalling you from administering your new territories. *there is a tiny bit of sarcasm to her voice*"
  daybreaker_uh:0 "Luna, don't make me-"
  luna_goodbye:0 "Farewell, Daybreaker. I wish you the best in protecting everypony. From you as much as outside threats."
  daybreaker_missing_the_point:0 "Luna..."
  luna_sleeping:0 "*She doesn't respond. Only a couple of loud snores escaping her lips.*"
  daybreaker_depart_forever:0 "Oh..."
  fin:0 "*Leave quietly and shut the door without making a sound.*"
