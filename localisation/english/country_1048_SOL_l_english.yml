  ###Leader Descriptions###
  POLITICS_DAYBREAKER_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: At least 2000 BLB\n\n§YBiography§!: For eons, the land of Equestria was protected by two sister alicorns to rule over the day and night. Their serene guidance helped establish strong ties between ponies, forming harmony that lasted for generations to come. Little is known where the sisters, Celestia and Luna, originated from. In their early rule, many venerated them as gods before they were kindly corrected.\n\nThe harmony of Equestria would not last, however, as the Great War of 1011 would shatter the idyllic outlook of her ponies. Out of this chaos, Daybreaker would emerge. She answered the call, overpowering what sanity Celestia had left to provide the final solution to her problems: unending, overwhelming firepower.\n\nDaybreaker is everything Celestia was not: pompous, arrogant, self-centered, aggressive. Her ponies are merely tools to her, the Solaris Adoratio (Solar Cult), the outlet to keep their fears at bay. Despite the decades since the collapse of the great Solar Empire, many still worship at her hooves, and Imperial society is one of endless adoration and sacrifice. Daybreaker cares little beyond one day reclaiming her rightful place as ruler, not just of the lands of Equestria, but one day the world. All will worship the sun, and Daybreaker will be the herald of their salvation.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: RyanBoi"
  POLITICS_CELESTIA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: At least 2000 BLB\n\n§YBiography§!: Long before the chaos of modern times, the land of Equestria was ruled by two sisters. One controlled the day; another controlled the night. Together, they led their ponies into an era of prosperity, peace, and happiness. These sisters, Celestia and Luna, were alicorns: powerful beings that bore the magical properties of all three species of pony. For centuries they ruled, but it would not last.\n\nLuna fell to the darkness, and Celestia was forced to seal her away in the moon, lest she destroy the world through her hubris. As Celestia was close to her sister, she grew distant and cold, plunging Equestria into a short time of intense heat. Strict laws were enacted, and her ponies chafed. At the peak of this, she reflected and saw herself repeating Luna's mistakes, and she stepped back from the precipice. This would continue for a thousand years, until Luna returned.\n\nIn the aftermath, the world experienced rapid development. Celestia believed that, with her reformed sister, they could weather the tides and live peaceful coexistence. This error in judgement cost her everything: her ponies, her country, her very self.\n\nFor forty years, she watched her alter ego, Daybreaker bring suffering to what was left of the nation of Equestria. Now that she is finally returned, she is wiser.\n\nAlthough she is much more merciful and serene than Daybreaker, her experiences have hardened Celestia's resolve. Now far more pragmatic, her kindest tendencies have faded to give way to a desire to see her wayward ponies protected from all that would threaten them. Her beloved nation, Equestria, will one day be restored, and her serene guidance will lead it into another golden era.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: RyanBoi"
  POLITICS_AURORA_SHINESPARK_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: September 6th, 1021 ALB\n\n§YBiography§!: One of the youngest ponies to achieve the rank of Archmage in the Solaris Inquisitionis, Aurora Shinespark grew up staunchly in the hardest portions of the Solar Empire. Raised in Manehattan, she experienced the first union riot of 1032, where she earned her cutie mark in infernal magic defending a pair of citizens from rogue workers.\n\nWhen she reached the appropriate age, she attended former Princess Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns, now Daybreaker's College for Talented Mages. Successfully reaching the rank of Mage, she was given a position as lieutenant of the former Archmage of her home city, Nebula Flare. However, Nebula Flare was declared a heretic, and fled the country, placing the fairly green Aurora in charge of the chapter.\n\nUnder her leadership, she held the peace in Manehattan, although little was done to resolve the unrest. While she can have a hoofs-off methodology, when pushed she will retaliate with appropriate force. As a loyal inquisitor, she ensures that ponies are kept in line.\n\nNow the Princess Regent, Aurora leads the nation with stern justice. Little of the entrenchment of the Adoratio and Inquisitionis in government has been addressed. Primarily, her goals are reconquest of the nation, ensuring that the position she was entrusted in follows Daybreaker's vision. The Empress' memory will be honored, and she will be venerated as the immortal, unstoppable being she is.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
  POLITICS_SUNSET_SHIMMER_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: March 23rd, 980 ALB\n\n§YBiography§!: Once the friendship student of Celestia, Sunset Shimmer grew jealous of other ponies and their rapid advancement through Celestia's school. She was not a stupid student, in fact she was a genius, but she considered friends and spending time with them beneath her. In 999 ALB, she broke into the forbidden library of the Canterlot Palace and found her escape. She would run to another world, return with its inhabitants, and conquer Equestria, setting herself up as its new ruler.\n\nThat did not go according to plan, and she was stopped by Celestia's following student, Twilight Sparkle. Although offered a place to return to, she insisted on residing with her new friends in this new world. The honeymoon period was short, and soon Sunset began to grow irritated with many of her friends' quirks.\n\nAlthough she remained connected with them, she let them drift apart, and when Daybreaker summoned her, she answered the call. Daybreaker trained her, forging her into the first leader of the revitalized Solaris Adoratio. Replacing Padlock Key, Sunset rebuilt the order from the ground up, making it the paramilitary arm of Daybreaker's control. All aspects of public life were dictated by the priestesses and battlemages of the order.\n\nBut, she was not satisfied. The Adoratio proclaimed to be family yet did not act like it. Change was still needed, and with Daybreaker's incapacitation, she has that chance. Solar society is still strict, but it is fair. Ponies have the freedom to worship Daybreaker as they wish, and already the spark of unity in the nation is resurging. For however long she lives, Sunset will ensure the memory of both her mentors lives on, forever engrained in the culture.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Avrameow"
  POLITICS_BLUEBLOOD_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: June 5th, 978 ALB\n\nBorn to some minor nobles in Canterlot, Blueblood was originally set for a life of middling success, petitioning for new laws or other bureaucratic monotony. However, after his parents' untimely demise, something he claimed he had no part in, the former Princess Celestia adopted him and treated him as her nephew. Overnight, Blueblood was catapulted into the lap of luxury, something which has stuck with him ever since.\n\nLike his counterpart, Sunset Shimmer, he was raised to learn the ways of friendship and harmony. Usually he managed to at least appear more competent in it, which he would lord over Sunset until she disappeared. After she vanished, little motivated him to continue his studies, and he devoted more time to dabbling in war and military theory than anything else.\n\nAs tensions with the changelings grew, Celestia knew that having somepony with knowledge on war would be imperative, and he was promoted to field marshal in 1010. Troops under his command soon complained of the pedantic nature of his requests, as he usually squandered supplies meant for the front lines.\n\nHowever, he was kept, and after Daybreaker's ascension, was given the title of Lord Commander of the Solaris Militarium, giving him near total control over the general army of the Solar Empire. Daybreaker still could pull rank over him, and this caused both to butt heads on numerous occasions. Now, with his successful coup, nopony can challenge his power.\n\nFrom his new position as Supplicant of the Empress, he has slowly started to reshape Imperial society. Despite being fat and lazy, his arrogance drives his one remaining passion: bending the citizenry to kneel before him. He, like the Empress before him, deserves total adoration, and all of the Empire will acknowledge him as Daybreaker's rightful successor.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
  POLITICS_DYX_DESC:0 "\"What? You want to know when I was popped out of her? I don't know, why do I have to be the damn chronicler?\n\n \"Yeah, the name's Dyx, and you probably know me as that bitch who is Daybreaker's kid. Guess what? That ain't an exaggeration. Do you think I just dyed my mane to look like little Empress Mommy over there? Please! I'd rather make it hot pink. Oh! Or blood red. Yeah! That'd be cool! Gotta find a way to do that...\n\n\"You want to know MORE about me? Jeez, why you gotta be so curious? I like dogs, long walks on the beaches, and a big serving of it's none of your Mommy-damned business, that's what. You want to know how I'll do in a fight? Sure, give me a gun, some cigs, maybe a bit of bubblegum, and we can kick some flank. How's that sound?\n\n\"Now get out of my face! You're cramping my style.\n\n\"Oh yeah, this beautiful mug was captured by §Y2hrnap§!. Weird name, but whatever. They got my good side.\""
  
  ###Unit Leaders###
  swift_waifu_desc:0 "§gBorn in Severyana, 967, Swift Wing was raised among her three older brothers. They were often two trots away from poverty, and thus it was no surprise that when their father enlisted for the Equestrian Guard, he took his children with him to Canterlot. Swift Wing received advanced education in one of Canterlot's private school. Once she became eligible for enlistment, she joined a different unit than her father's. Swift Wing's constitution ensured she passed the most rigorous exercises, towering over most of the stallions. When Severyana rose up in rebellion, she did not side with her homeland, stressing that loyalty to Equestria comes first and foremost. Afterward during the first Changeling invasion in 1002, Swift Wing was blinded in her right eye when a stray grenade detonated too close. She continued to serve in the Royal Engineer Corps regardless in a supporting role. Her tenacity in the face of injuries and setbacks inspires the soldiers under her command.§!""

  EQS_purging_the_remnant_desc:0 "Although the Empress has ruled for almost forty years, there are still heretics that defy her deity. Starlight Glimmer and Trixie Lulamoon are chiefest among them, and have organized resistance cells for decades. The Empress has tolerated them long enough! The Inquisitionis will scour the Empire in search of their location, beginning with weaklings in the Solaris Militarium."
  
  EQS_burning_the_countryside:0 "Burning the Countryside"
  EQS_burning_the_countryside_desc:0 "It would be impossible for Starlight and Trixie to remain undetected in urban centers, for the Empress's presence is all ecompassing there. There are indications they've organized in the sympathetic towns and villages, and that is where the Inquisitionis will search."

  EQS_incinerating_the_chaff_desc:0 "Once the site of a great battle between the Solaris Adoratio and the heretical harmonists, Ponyville has been a hotbed of heretics since its capture, and the local chapter there has been largely ineffective.

  EQS_truth_in_flame:0 "The Truth in the Flame"
  EQS_truth_in_flame_desc:0 "At last, we have found a pony who knows something. A mine forestallion attempted to flee as the Inquisitionis worked through his station. There is already more than enough evidence to convict him of heresy, it is only a matter of how much he will tell."

  EQS_scouring_the_cities_desc:0 "While the Empress may be all-seeing, she still can not notice every little detail at once.

  EQS_clearing_the_filth:0 "Clearing the Filth"
  EQS_clearing_the_filth_desc:0 "Fillydelphia has a large population of disenfranchised and homeless ponies. What better breeding ground for heretical teachings and disloyalty? It will only be a small fire that cleanses them, and they are of little other value. Perhaps there will be clues in the ashes."

  EQS_empress_give_wisdom:0 "For the Empress Shall Give Us Wisdom"
  EQS_empress_give_wisdom_desc:0 "Pointed by the last heretic, we've raided a house outside of Fillydelphia and returned with a new heretic. This Slick Deal has already blubbered ad nauseum his innocence, and should be easily broken to speak the truth."

  EQS_scorched_salvation_desc:0 "From the union members, we have determined that some of the mill workers have funneled supplies to certain dead drop locations throughout the seaboard. Nothing is concrete, but it isn't a problem that can't be solved by a little heat."
  
  EQS_chat_with_mayor:0 "A "Chat" with the Mayor"
  EQS_chat_with_mayor_desc:0 "Manehattan is growing more rotten by the day, and it is only possible because of Mayor Goldmane's incompetence, or willing cooperation. Whichever it is, he will not have to worry about the state of his city for long."

  EQS_purification_through_fire_desc:0 "Although he didn't know anything, Goldmane's office has been funneling bits into dummy accounts. These accounts have either been drained into others, or closed. However, one was tied to his assistant. They shall be most informative."

  EQS_second_census:0 "The Second Imperial Census"
  EQS_second_census_desc:0 "Not since the Great Collapse following the war with the changelings has the Imperial Statistics Committee accurately tabulated the number of ponies living within the Imperium of the Sun. Acolytes and Initiates of the Adoratio and Inquisitionis will be used to gather the data. It will surely help with tracking down a few lingering harmonists."
  
  EQS_heretics_not_apply:0 "Heretics Need Not Apply"
  EQS_heretics_not_apply_desc:0 "While it is impossible to prevent heretics from slipping into the working population, implementing tighter controls and tests for loyalty and faith in the Empress will root out previously undetected threats. Reassurance that the Inquisitionis will punish all those that are found will only benefit society in the end."

  EQS_reeducating_unions_desc:0 "While outside of Manehattan they are a rarity, some more prominent unions have been protesting Daybreaker's latest rounds of taxes and reworked labor laws.

  EQS_quotas_harsh_but_necessary:0 "Quotas: Harsh but Necessary"
  EQS_quotas_harsh_but_necessary_desc:0 "It has become clear that to dredge the Empire's economy out of the gutter that the remnants of the free market must be clamped down upon. One of the first orders of business will be to implement basic quotas throughout the Empire on certain basic needs for both citizen and soldier. Factories will have to learn diversification fast if they wish to survive."
  
  EQS_imperial_committee:0 "The Imperial Committee on Civilian Resources"
  EQS_imperial_committee_desc:0 "Many advancements in magitech have been hoarded away by independent inventors over the years. While their methods were suspect, and their conclusions filled with heresy, there were still sparks of brilliance in them that they left in their notes.

  EQS_build_up:0 "Build Up Not Out"
  EQS_build_up_desc:0 "To save on further encroaching of precious farmland, new subsidies will be provided to encourage the creation of new hive complexes. These towering skyscrapers will house many ponies as they work for the factories of the megalopolises of the Empire."
  
  EQS_reforming_imperial_infrastructure:0 "Reforming the Imperial Infrastructure"
  EQS_reforming_imperial_infrastructure_desc:0 "Much of the underlying roads and supply lines of the Solar Empire have not been improved since before the Great War. Patch jobs can only keep the byways and highways usuable for so long before they crumble to dust. New advancements must be found to keep intercity trade flowing."
  
  EQS_imperial_innovation:0 "Imperial Innovation"
  EQS_imperial_innovation_desc:0 "A careful balance is struck in the Empire between theological orthodoxy and scientific boundary pushing. As of late, the pendulum has been swinging further into the religious camp.

  EQS_imperial_projects:0 "Reassessing Imperial Projects"
  EQS_imperial_projects_desc:0 "Despite the last seccession wars with the rump states finished a decade ago, little has been done to improve the underlying weakness in the civilian industry. Much of the funding dedicated from prior years were diverted to Sanctum Solar for unnamed beauty projects. The first step is ending the blight of the citizenry will be rooting out the corrupt officials who snagged this money in the first place."
  
  EQS_fueling_fury:0 "Fueling the Fires of Fury"
  EQS_fueling_fury_desc:0 "With the initial reforms of the economy finished, and many old guard bureaucrats jobless or lifeless, new initiatives can be instated to motivate additional changes to the economic structure. With new pools of bits for construction of factories, more ponies will be working for the Empress within short order."
  
  EQS_bit_reevaluation:0 "Reevaluating the Imperial Bit"
  EQS_bit_reevaluation_desc:0 "At the time of Daybreaker's ascension, the Equestrian Bit was the literal gold standard of the continental economy. With the subsequent losses of territory after the peace with the changelings, much of that trust was lost; a single bit then could purchase food worth fifty bits today. Rebasing or retiring the bit is paramount, although what shall replace it remains unseen."
  
  EQS_new_imperial_standard:0 "A New Imperial Standard"
  EQS_new_imperial_standard_desc:0 "After much deliberation, the Imperial Bit will be retired and replaced with the Imperial Credit. While still nominally tied to the amount of gold in the Empire's coffers, these will only be issued on paper, and will allow for tighter control of the money supply. It only requires that ponies return their bits in exchange of an appropriate amount of credits, which will be easier said than done."
  
  EQS_dross_purged:0 "The Dross has been Purged"
  EQS_dross_purged_desc:0 "With the reforms to the economy, the Solar Empire's outlook has been improving at a steady rate. Employment has shot through the roof, ponies are investing their new hard-earned credits into the few luxuries available and allowed to them, and revenues have increased across the board. The Empire can look to the future to forge its destiny as an economic superpower once again."
  
  EQS_burning_path_through_countryside:0 "Burning Through the Countryside"
  EQS_burning_path_through_countryside_desc:0 "The main rail line between Sanctum Solar and Manehattan has seen better days. Like much of the Imperial infrastructure, it has its roots in Equestria, and has not seen much updating since then. Demolishing the old lines and creating new ones are the only way to see improved throughput in travel and supply. Some of the farmers didn't need their land, anyway."
  
  EQS_integral_industry:0 "Integral Imperial Industry"
  EQS_integral_industry_desc:0 "As much as the Empire relies heavily on its military power and industry, it is the simple pony who works at the factory, or the meagre construction worker who builds the roads that deserve the true recognition. To that end, new subsidies will be established to stimulate further development in the civilian economy, for it will keep the Empire strong."
  
  ###Center Path###
  EQS_new_imperial_bureaucracy:0 "A New Imperial Bureaucracy"
  EQS_new_imperial_bureaucracy_desc:0 "Much of the lower rungs of the Imperial government is a leftover from when Equestria was ruled by a weak, limp-hoofed leader. These sycophants and bluebloods are nothing but parasites, and cleaning them from Sanctum Solar will speed the creation of future laws."
  
  EQS_all_empress_knowledge:0 "All Knowledge Stems from the Empress"
  EQS_all_empress_knowledge_desc:0 "For the the benefit of the economy, a new board dedicated to proper Imperial thought will be created.

  EQS_citizen_board:0 "A Citizenry Advisory Board"
  EQS_citizen_board_desc:0 "Without a strong consumer backbone the Empire will get nowhere.

  EQS_in_many_numbers:0 "In Many Numbers Wisdom can be Gleaned"
  EQS_in_many_numbers_desc:0 "As much as the Empress does know everything, sometimes the additional experience of other ponies is required. These ponies could temper expectations, or ensure that duties are fulfilled in an efficient and timely manner without straining Daybreaker by requiring she monitor every last detail."
  
  EQS_empress_knows_best:0 "Only the Empress Knows Best"
  EQS_empress_knows_best_desc:0 "To suggest that anypony other than the God-Empress would know what is the most profitable ventures would be absurd. Creating a position on the board for the Empress whenever she wishes to preside would provide an effective and speedy way to resolve internal conflicts within the board. Nopony would dare question her, after all."
  
  EQS_regional_directors:0 "Regional Directors Will Keep the Quotas Up"
  EQS_regional_directors_desc:0 "By keeping the basic parts of the Imperial economy decentralized through officers tasked with keeping tally of specific production requirements, the board can focus on avenues that can improve the overall efficiency of production.

  EQS_tricking_trixie_desc:0 "Trixie Lulamoon, for all her supposed strengths, is a foolish pony. Aside from daring to stand against the might of the Empress, she has always been more insecure in her relationships with other ponies. Acting out through magic was one way to gain attention. Now, the Empress will show Trixie exactly what she missed."
  
  EQS_trixie_curtain_call:0 "The Magician's Curtain Call"
  EQS_trixie_curtain_call_desc:0 "Surprisingly, Trixie was more resistant than anticipated. Her devotion to Starlight and to her friends would be commendable, if it weren't so aggravating. However, everypony has their breaking point, and after being shown the \"truth\" by Daybreaker, Trixie should be willing to accept Daybreaker's offer and forgiveness."

  EQS_born_again_desc:0 "At last, justice has been served. After months spent with the Empress, Starlight and Trixie have seen the light.

Instead, an offer will be provided: they can be allowed to exist, but a certain number of Inquisitionis acolytes and mages must be on their boards, to ensure proper compliance with Imperial doctrine. For the betterment of the workers, of course."

  EQS_operation_clean_slate_desc:0 "Most of the industrial sector of Manehattan has been decimated by the uprising.

  EQS_placate_clergy_desc:0 "What is the point in assuring the average pony that things will be okay if their leaders are unsure of it themselves? While the Empress was... not herself, the archmages of the various Ordos allowed things to decay to the state that the Empire is in today.

  EQS_improve_inadequacy_desc:0 "The idiots that were supposed to control the government - the various noble families that were allowed to live through Daybreaker's conquests - did almost nothing as the Empire crumbled around everypony.

  EQS_forever_angry:0 "Forever an Angry Goddess"
  #EQS_forever_angry_desc:0 "There is a new confidence, a new sashay to the Empress. Before her brush with death and devil, she would lash out at any who received her ire.

Anypony who doesn't like it will not be there to protest for long."

  EQS_prove_themselves_desc:0 "Not all of the nobility are entirley usless. In fact, there are even some ponie who aren't proper aristocracy who have remained faithful advisors to the Empress.

  EQS_counsel_councilors_desc:0 "Comprised of the most trusted ponies in the Empire, the Imperial Diet was supposed to give insight to various aspects of the Empire while Daybreaker concerned herself with the larger picture.

  EQS_lonely_top:0 "Lonely at the Top"
  EQS_lonely_top_desc:0 "Nopony can truly understand the mind of the God-Empress, for she has had to sacrifice so much for the protection of the Empire.

  EQS_punish_heresy:0 "Heresy Must be Punished"
  EQS_punish_heresy_desc:0 "It is not enough that heresy has been almost vanquished from the Solar Empire. All around us lay dens of heathenry and rebellion.

  EQS_force_sides_together:0 "Force the Two Sides Together"
  EQS_force_sides_together_desc:0 "This nonsense of intersectional rivalry must stop. While Sunset has not been a primary aggressor in it, she has not always accepted some of Quasar Pulse's more outlandish schemes.

  EQS_tighten_loins:0 "Tighten Their Loins"
  EQS_tighten_loins_desc:0 "The Militarium has been a money-sink for years, and its generals have grown used to having endless resources to squander.

  EQS_no_complacency:0 "No More Complacency"
  EQS_no_complacency_desc:0 "Blueblood is the ringleader of the Militarium's entire decline. The failures he suffered early in his career after Daybreaker ascended allowed him to become comfortable with mediocrity, which has plagued him his whole life. He will not like it, but it's time for him to learn a few new things. Perhaps it will be of use."
  EQS_goddess_of_battle:0 "Goddess of Battle"
  EQS_goddess_of_battle_desc:0 "In previous conflicts after the war with Stalliongrad, Daybreaker took a progressively lesser role, as her duties with the Empire grew, and she fought to maintain internal stability.

  EQS_master_student:0 "A Student has become the Master"
  EQS_master_student_desc:0 "While Sunset has grown a bit less sharp in her older age, she is still more than teachable. When she first came back to Equestria, she received much training under the Empress to improve her knowledge of war.

  EQS_everypony_fight:0 "Everypony Will Fight"
  EQS_everypony_fight_desc:0 "It is the duty of every citizen of the Empire to lay down their lives for the Empress if need be. For over a generation, this has not been required, as the presser gangs could keep the nominal number of soldiers at a constant level to protect what he had. But now nopony can deny the call.

  EQS_plucking_heretics_desc:0 "When self-styled Marshal Soarin left to form the Cloudsdale Autonomy in 1026, he relocated the great cloud city to where he believed it safer.

  EQS_faith_over_science_desc:0 "The last and greatest of the deserters. Bales has only been \"independent\" since 1028, Bales will no longer taint the land with their \"science\" and \"secularism.\" They ironically hold so much faith in their technology and their knowledge, denying the Empress her deity, and believing nothing will stop them from her righteous wrath.

  EQS_empire_to_heel_desc:0 "It has yet to be forgotten the insult that Cadance inflicted upon the Solar Empire when she refused the call to defend against the swarms of Queen Chrysalis.

  EQS_entice_disloyal_generals_desc:0 "Although not many would admit it publicly, Cadance was not the most popular of monarchs in [CRY.GetNameDef]. As the military had been gutted for years, officers and soldiers alike had to make do with breadcrumbs and outdated equipment. These strains have made a few generals potential targets for redemption. They would be useful controlling the former region, too."

  EQS_remove_thorns_desc:0 "Corruption has run rampant inside the ranks of [CRY.GetNameDef]'s governmental bodies. Ponies of all levels working for their own gain, sapping what is left of the wealth of this nation dry to stay comfortable. On top of that, they do not acknowledge the Empress as their mistress! This must be corrected immediately."
  EQS_establish_transitional_government:0 "Establish a Transitional Government"
  EQS_establish_transitional_government_desc:0 "Although it is undeniable that there is corruption within the government, it would be impractical to wholly throw them into the Holy Flame, as they have had years to learn the ins and outs of the machine in [CRY.GetNameDef] and could prove useful so long as we are convincing enough to have htem serve us. Perhaps the offer of forgiveness, and its alternative, would be enough."

  EQS_useful_as_prisoners_desc:0 "While it would be satisfying and justice to see the princesses, Twilight Sparkle, Cadance, Flurry Heart, and Luna, to be executed like the false goddesses they are, they hold significant sway over [CRY.GetNameDef].

Yet, that is not the case. Already, we have begun to re-educate the misguided ponies, but to complete the work, we must remove anything that could bring back the brainwashing.

  EQS_ordain_the_scientific_method_desc:0 "With many of the social and religious reforms that Sunset has done, she feels confident that she can push through one more: Science has slowed much since the Empire has formed, as it asks many unorthodox questions.

  EQS_battering_the_remaining_separation_desc:0 "For the better part of the Empire's existence, the government and the Solaris Adoratio have remained separate entities underneath the Empress.

This has caused immeasurable strife on the average pony, with some barely able to afford to have a meal in a day.

  EQS_guardians_for_the_orphans_desc:0 "Numerous foals were left without parents and orphanages were abandoned in the aftermath of the crisis, leaving untold thousands of young ponies to fend for themselves while the city is rebuilt.

  EQS_stimulus_for_the_local_economy_desc:0 "The riots of the union protesters ultimately punished the ponies they were supposedly standing up for than anything else.

  EQS_invest_in_new_architecture_desc:0 "Skeletal remains of many skyscrapers stand as a stark reminder of the damage that was thrust upon Manehattan.

  EQS_watchful_inquisitors_desc:0 "Heresy and unrest is rife in our new borderlands, and the Militarium is far from the most competent choice when it comes to keeping the peace.

  solar.1.t:0 "Thy Will be Done"
  solar.1.d:0 "Light poured through the simple windows of the room. It was small, square, and sparsely decorated. A basic cot was on one corner, and a small wardrobe filled with cloaks and robes was open. In the center of the room, facing into the sunlight and muttering under her breath, a small white unicorn basked in the warmth of Daybreaker's sun.\n\n"Oh Goddess, hallowed be thy Sun," she began praying aloud. To her, the sunshine coming in the from window wasn't just signifying a new day: it was Harmony and Order itself, cleansing her mind of any impure thoughts and healing her body of any harm caused by the darkness of Night.\n\nShe spread herself out on the floor, prostrate toward the window. "As your Sun purifies the world with its light, so too, let it purify our actions. Forgive us our daily sins and lead us not into heresy. Protect us from the forces of Chaos and Disorder, and strengthen our resolve against the heretic. May the fires of your wrath bring swift destruction to your foes. Give us this day the victory against the enemy!"\n\nSlowly, the unicorn got to her hooves, muttering under her breath, "Thy Empire come, thy will be done, on Equus as it is in Sanctum Solar. Amen."\n\nAurora Shinespark gathered herself and thanked the God-Empress for another day in the Empire. Turning around, she reached out with her orange magic to take her inquisitor's cloak. She fastened the dark red and orange cloak to her back, and she brushed down her dark orange and brown mane.\n\n "Sol Invicta, archmage!" one of the inquisitors cried as she left her room. Aurora returned the greeting and sat down. The rest followed suit.\n\nDuring breakfast, they poured over various letters and documents that had been scattered across the table. Manehattan was a special case in the Empire. As it was the primary production base, the citizens were allowed slightly more freedoms than other cities. The Manehatten chapter was tasked with maintaining Harmony and Order in the city, especially against communist infiltration.\n\n"There is a rally today in Slavation Plaza protesting conditions in the uniform factories," a creamy unicorn with tan spots stated.\n\n "Very well," Aurora answered after taking a bite of food. "Fidelis Flamma and Novus Flux! Attend the protest and ensure that no heretics provoke a riot." She turned back to the first pony. "Is there any news on the potential Harmonist terrorist cell?"\n\n"No, archmage," the inquisitor replied. "The Speculatores have returned no new information. The corruption grows deeper, but they are unable to find the source."\n\n"Worrisome," Aurora murmured. Before she could continue, the door to the chapter house opened and a messenger arrived, out of breath from a long travel. "Speak," she barked.\n\n"Aurora Shinespark," he began, gathering as much pomp as he could muster. "You have been summoned to Sanctum Solar. The Empress wishes to speak with you concerning grave matters. You will depart for the holy city at once.""
  solar.1.a:0 "What does the Empress require of me?"
  solar.2.t:0 "Heresy Abounds"
  solar.2.d:0 ""What does the Empress require of me?" Aurora pondered as she approached the entrance to Daybreaker's throne room. Guards of the Solaris Militarium roved the halls, their hooves clanking on the exposed stonework.\n\nFlanking her on either side were a pair of inquisitors, their harsh glares making her feel like she was on trial for heresy. As they creaked open the massive bolted doors, they announced her presence. Waves of heat hit her, instantly causing her to break out into a sweat.\n\nAt the far end of the room, easily a hundred feet distant, the God-Empress sat on her throne, unmoving and watching Aurora with brown and yellow cat-like eyes. She looked to the two guards stationed either side the steps to her throne. "Leave us," she stated and her guards instantly obeyed.\n\nAurora prostrated herself on the marble floor, waiting for Daybreaker's stern yet soft command to rise. When she did, she briefly met the Empress's gaze, but she quickly averted her eyes. It was like Daybreaker could see every thought Aurora had.\n\nClicking her tongue, Daybreaker turned Aurora's face back toward her and she stated in a soothing voice, "Fear not, Aurora. I have a task for you." She smiled and faced the great bay window overlooking the spires and towers of Sanctum Solar.\n\nAurora gulped as she observed Daybreaker. Her armor glittered in her sun, the orange and gold reflecting sharply back into Aurora's eyes. As she approached, Daybreaker snarled and growled, "I have sacrificed much to protect Harmony and Order in MY Empire, and yet my own generals repay me with heresy!" Her mane pulsed a few flashes of violent purple and blue before returning to its normal orange.\n\nHer brow crinkled in anger, she stomped a hoof on the ground and barked, "You are the first of a few inquisitors that will be tasked with rooting out this heresy once and for all!" Holding up a hoof, she added, "But first, you will be dispatched to Trotsville."\n\nAs Aurora tilted her head in confusion, Daybreaker ruffled her wings and she stated, "The Solaris Speculatores has discovered it has ben harboring heretics for months. They were offered mercy, to turn over their vermin, but refused. Punish them by Holy Fire, for it is the only solution to Chaos."\n\nWalking past Aurora, she settled back down on her throne and waved a hoof dismissively. "When you return, you can deal with the heretics in the Militarium. For now, Trotsville is your target. May the Fires of My Sun aid you, Archmage."\n\nBowing, Aurora replied, "The Holy Flame shall guide me." She quickly departed, her first thought the need for a shower."
  solar.2.a:0 "I shall not fail you, my Empress!"
  solar.3.t:0 "Rooting Out Corruption"
  solar.3.d:0 "Thunderbolt Sentinel observed the small hamlet of Trotsville from the skies. "It's just part of the job," he thought, taking a deep breath and fighting back the growing lump in his stomach that was trying to move its way up his throat.\n\n"I suppose it was going to catch up to me at some point," he mused to himself, looking back at the archmage. Aurora Shinespark, or some such, Daybreaker's inquisitor to ensure he stayed loyal. They all sounded alike. All looked similar, too. She noticed the older stallion watching her and returned it with a stern glare. Shuddering, he turned back to look at the approaching hamlet. He could sense the piercing golden eyes of the archmage still focused on him.\n\nSighing, he turned and faced Aurora. Her white fur stood out against the deep oranges and reds of her cloak, and ornate rings decorated her horn. After a moment of silence, the two eying each other cautiously, he finally asked, "How do you it?"\n\nHer expression remained unchanged, and she spoke in the condescending manner as a mother would with a wayward foal. "It is a simple decision. Harmonist agitators were discovered and the citizens refused to arrest them. The Empress has decreed that—"\n\n"Yes, that all those who do not abide by true Harmony and Order are heretics." Thunderbolt finished, trying hard not to derisively spitting out the last word. "My question is: how do you condemn innocent ponies to die?"\n\nShaking her head, her deep orange mane swaying with the motion, she said, "Would you not sacrifice a few thousand innocents for the salvation of millions more? If heresy is not stamped out at the roots where it grows, it will spread to other towns. It will then spread to the cities, before reaching Sanctum Solar itself."\n\nWith a scowl, she got within inches of Thunderbolt's face. Fire as bright as the Empress' Sun shone in her eyes as she continued, "This decision is never done lightly, and I pray the souls of those who are truly loyal to the Empress will find peace in the next life."\n\nShe motioned at the pilot, who opened the bombardier doors. Below, the small houses of Trotsville began to zoom past, a few specks visible to Thunderbolt: ponies going about their day without any idea of what was going to happen.\n\n"Do not look away, Thunderbolt Sentinel. Remember the price of heresy." Aurora cantered past the general and observed out the cockpit window as the squadron unleashed their payloads on the hamlet below.\n\nThere was a bright flash, and soon heat began to assault his face. Flames began spreading across the streets of Trotsville and the screams of those who were unfortunate enough to be caught in the napalm blast reached his ears. Whether out of fear or regret, he could not say, he watched as flames engulfed the hamlet. The price of heresy. The price of challenging Daybreaker's rule."

Although I am pleased that Daybreaker is finally taking this threat more seriously, it gravely concerns me that now of all times was determined to search through MY Ordo.\n\nIf you were not already aware—which I'm sure you are—Ordo Mellis provides most of the food for the Empire. I still recall the last time that inquisitors from Ordo Solis were dispatched to investigate heresy here in Ponyville. It is understandable the Empress's hatred of this place, but must they have purposefully destroyed part of the harvest for the Empire's mouths?\n\nOur only speculatore has recently found word of potential cells that have grown here.

I am pleased that the Empress has at last seen the problem that lingering heresy has caused in our empire and wishes to finally see it stamped out permanently. As of late, the section of the Speculatores that has been assigned to Ordo Apparatus has unearthed concerning details of a heretic network, the likes of which has been unseen since I started served the Goddess.\n\nWhile I understand that keeping watch over the Empire is a never-ending job and you must have numerous other leads that you must follow, the first threads that have come to me by way of the infiltrator, Gravity Lens, leads me to believe this may be more important.\n\nThere is a cancer growing in our cities, Lady Inquisitor.

  solar.10.d:0 ""I'm telling you, I don't know what in Daybreaker's sweet name you're talking about," Topsoil grunted as he glared daggers at the inquisitor standing before him.\n\nShe was such a tiny thing, yet she was bossing him around like she owned the place. If he wanted to, he could probably kick her down the road back to where she and her kind came from. But she also managed to command a presence that gave him pause. A fire burned in her eyes that spoke of the steel will that engulfed her, and crossing that line might be the last mistake he'd ever make.\n\n"Our sources say otherwise," the inquisitor tersely replied. She leaned hard against the post of one of his doors, revealing that others were currently searching near his barn a short distance away.\n\n"Hey! Order your friends away from that!" he snapped, slamming a hoof on the ground. Normally most folks would be scared by his bulky frame making such noise, but the mare remained unphased.\n\n"My fellow servants are only being thorough," the mare responded, stepping forward and into the house. Each one was taken at a saunter, and she confidently stared back at him with a smirk. "According to records, you've had discrepancies with your grain reports. Discrepancies that do not appear the work of random chance."\n\nAt that, Topsoil's face flushed and he snarled. Were they accusing him of heresy?! Him?! One of the ponies who fought and nearly died for Daybreaker in the South-East War?\n\n"We've been having some critters break into silos every now and then and ruining some of the crops, sure," he answered, furrowing his brow and matching the inquisitor's harsh gaze. "But I ain't supporting any of those Harmonist sons of bitches! I nearly—"\n\n"Yes, yes, you nearly died fighting for the Empress," the mare replied nonchalantly. She brushed aside some of her golden mane and she continued, "But heresy can always take root, no matter how loyal somepony once was. We shall find other ways if you hinder things further." She glanced over his shoulder, and he went pale as he heard a nervous shuffle behind him.\n\nPeering back to see his daughter, Tulip, looking over the railing of their second-floor staircase, he finally stuttered, "D-Don't you dare bring my family into—"\n\nSuddenly, the mare held up her hoof. From the barn, a couple of inquisitors were calling toward her, and she listened for a second. Turning back to sneer at him, she stated, "We shan't be bothering you any further, Topsoil." She stepped out of the way to reveal a roaring inferno where his barn once stood.\n\nFalling to his knees, Topsoil whimpered as she cantered away down the road. "Remember next time to not hamper Imperial justice!""

  solar.11.d:0 "Archmage Iron Tail's head was killing her.\n\nFor the last half a day, she had been at this with a couple of her underlings, trying to break through the mental defenses that their captive had erected.\n\nAt this point, it had reached nearly midnight, and she longed to get out of the stuffy office, which had only a pair of piercing lights to make the heretic more uncomfortable. In the end, it only served to worsen her growing migraine. She snarled and grunted as she pushed herself off the wall.\n\nBy this point, she had taken off her robe—it was far too warm in here, plus, it gave a slight edge to intimidation. At least she felt that way, as she felt a couple of scars from the mining accident years ago itch in the festering heat.\n\n"Enough," she barked at her lieutenant, Ardent Slag. The earth pony merely scowled at her in return but obeyed.\n\nAs she stepped back, Iron Tail trudged forward and scrutinized the mare that limply lay on the table before her. With her magic, she snatched one of the two hanging lights and shone the beams right into the heretic's eyes. In return, the mare blinked a few times before squinting away, her face bloodied and battered from the hours of interrogation.\n\nBreathing heavily, she glowered up at Iron Flail as the archmage covered the light with her own pleasant features. She coughed once, then spat at Iron Trail, who flinched away. "Go to Tartarus," she spat. "You won't get anything from me."\n\nWiping her face, Iron Trail flicked the saliva away and then she scoffed. "We already have enough evidence from those maps and papers you had in your office to burn you on the spot, heretic." She clicked her tongue. "But you know more, the Lady Inquisitor is sure of it."\n\n"She's an egotistical maniac," the mare snarled back before hacking up a bit of blood.\n\n"Perhaps," Iron Tail admitted with a shrug. Glancing back at the wall of the room, she trotted to near the door and snatched a large flail made of carbonized steel. The clinking of its chains caught the other mare's attention, and Iron Tail sneered. "But we have ways to make you talk."\n\n"You've already tried everything," the mare snapped back, her green eyes filled with fury. Bloodily glowering at her, the mare growled, "I'll never talk."\n\n"I was hoping you were going to say that," Iron Tail leered, her magic flashing brightly as the steel flail caught fire with magical flames. As she saw the mare's eyes widen, she cackled and moved in. Her head was feeling better already."

  solar.12.d:0 "It fit the heretics well that they would hide in the dampest, dankest portions of the Empire, Inferna thought to herself.\n\nFew ponies ventured into the sewers of any of the hive cities of the Solar Empire, the great megalopolises of Daybreaker, Manehattan, Fillydelphia, and of course Sanctum Solar. Why would there be any reason? Most of the sanitizing was handled there with durable spell matrices that cleansed the filth before it ever reached the water suppl, thereby allowing for a recyclable system.\n\nOf course, because there was little reason to investigate, there was more motivation to hide. Which was exactly what she and her squad of acolytes had discovered.\n\nNestled in the wall of one of the tunnels was a rusty steel door. It took four unicorns to pry it off the wall, as it was locked tighter than a church in Bales. And that was where they found the treasure trove.\n\n"Well?" she asked one of her acolytes as she kicked at one of the dead bodies of a unicorn. She wrinkled her nose when the soaked pony came closer. This one was the one that fell into the sewage at some point. Of course.\n\nPanting a bit, the pony glanced at the two heretics that were killed when they entered, then at the one that was still breathing. Some blood dribbled down his temples, but he was alive.\n\n"He's stable, Mage Inferna," the pony replied as she beat her chest in a salute. "We have started to tear apart the room for any records of further cells. If there are any active ones, we'll find them."\n\n"Good," Inferna replied as she trotted closer to the stallion, the lone radio operator that was there when they burst in. "Inform the Lady Inquisitor that we've found a lead." As the acolyte saluted again, Inferna gagged and choked at the stench."

  solar.13.d:0 ""I swear, I'll tell you everything! Just let me go!"\n\nNormally, Slick Deal wouldn't be so open to bartering right off the bat. Most often, he'd pick his target, soften them up, usually with a nice meal, then open to them regarding his special contacts. These contacts always had money, and always were looking for talent or parts, things that he'd easily been able to acquire with the right know-how.\n\nBut now, he had wheeled one too many times. That last mare, who was scorching hot and far too interested in his line of work, had turned out to be one of Daybreaker's speculatores. How they'd found out about a simple constallion like him still remained a mystery, but he wasn't stupid. Cooperate with the law, and you got a lighter sentence.\n\nThat was how it went in those old movies, right?\n\nFlinching, Slick drew back as there was a sudden burst of light from a pair of torches. Tears stung his eyes as the searing heat brushed against his legs. Straining on the ropes that bound him, he again cried, "Look, look! You want names? I can get you names! You want where I stashed the goods? I can do that! Just let me go!"\n\n"Now, why would we do that, heretic?" a self-assured voice asked innocently. Protruding from the inky blackness, a slightly lighter black muzzle appeared before a mare, dressed in the fine robes of the Inquisition slithered into view.\n\n"Wh-what do you want? I'm not a heretic! I just help ponies find—"\n\nThe mare didn't say anything. Instead, she snatched one of the torches in her magic and she calmly pushed the wick of the torch into his left haunch.\n\nAs he screamed from the boiling flesh on his side, she sneered.

It was only two in the afternoon, but he'd already done all his mayoral duties for the day. Most ponies would call him lazy, he considered himself an expert delegator. Plus, showing up and nodding a few times at budget meetings was hard! Concentrating on all those statistics? Boring!\n\nHe hummed to himself as he stared out the window of his spacious office. Perhaps it was time to contact his secretary, let her know that he'd be on another of his "self-improvement" periods and—\n\n"Mayor Goldmane," the crackling voice of his secretary stated tiredly over the intercom at his desk.\n\nWith a grunt, he trotted over and fixed his tie. "Yes, Miss Petal, what is it?"\n\n"There are a trio of inquisitors who wish to see you." There was a smack of gum on the other line.\n\n"Ugh! Tell them I'm busy and I mustn't be—" Before he could even finish his sentence, the white doors of his office burst open, shooting splinters in all directions. One of them scratched his immaculate cheeks.\n\nScoffing, he furrowed his brow as he heard his secretary call in, "They were insistent, sir!"\n\nStanding before him were three inquisitors, the leader the only mage, identified by the gold and red stripe on her cloak. The red mare frowned as she glowered back at him with deep blue eyes. "Luscious Goldmane," she grumbled, her expression only growing angrier.\n\nBefore he could answer the obvious, he was cut off by the mage and she snarled, "We wish to speak to you about the... oddities discovered as of late." She stalked a bit closer, and Goldmane gulped.\n\n"I'm sure that we can talk this out," he stuttered. Had they come for the irregularities in the pension funds? The nepotistic contracts? The fact he jaywalked last week?\n\n"That remains to be seen if you're honest," the mage quipped back, lighting her horn and slamming the door shut behind her."

They were investigating more than just all the little accounting accidents that had slipped under his radar. In fact, it was thanks to her that they even knew about that to begin with.\n\nCurrently the Inquisitionis was getting a bit too close, and she had to cool the heat somehow. Goldmane wasn't truly an innocent, and in the new order, he'd have been prosecuted and probably executed either way. What was the point in delaying the inevitable.\n\nAs she continued to chew on her gum, she eventually tutted to herself as she pulled out a couple of sheets of paper. Deftly signing them with Goldmane's own signature, a forger's move that only few could master, she jumped when the door to his office exploded open and the lead inquisitor, Nova Glow, marched back out. There was a bright red stain on her cloak, and she was skulking toward the exit.\n\nGlancing back into the room, Daffodil grimaced as she took in the scene. It'd require a good scrubbing from the maids, that was for sure.\n\nHolding back some contempt, she tiredly snarked, "Have a good day, Inquisitor!"\n\nAs Nova Glow grunted, she turned and then stared at the desk. For a second, Daffodil felt her heart skip and then Nova started to trudge closer. As she grabbed one of the papers, she muttered, "These were not here when we entered his office." She slammed the one form back onto the desk. It was regarding a transfer of supplies to a warehouse near the edge of the city.\n\n"Buck," Daffodil swore under her breath.\n\n"I believe that we shall learn more about each other very soon," Nova Glow snarled, motioning for her two inquisitors to surround the desk.\n\nRapidly flicking through her options, Daffodil did the only thing she could. Bucking backward against the desk, she clipped Nova Glow along the chest and then darted toward the bay window of the waiting room.

As we listened for some time, we caught a brief burst that we determined came from the Crystal Empire to somewhere in the city itself.\n\nWe were unable to determine the entire makeup of the message, but something is happening soon, and it appears it will be heavily coordinated across the entire city of Manehattan. The rumors that Starlight Glimmer and Trixie Lulamoon are in the city are true, as we did catch mention of one of their names in the transmission.\n\nThe Empress must be warned at once! This heresy must be stamped out before they can destroy the city!\n\nPlease forgive my forwardness, and if I must perish for my break in hierarchy, I will accept it if it saves the Empire.\n\nSol Invictus!\n\nMage Nova Glow, Manehattan Chapter, Ordo Multi"

  solar.17.t:0 "Heresy's Reward"
  solar.17.d_found:0 "Leaning back in her chair, Lady Inquisitor Quasar Pulse cackled and inspected the mounds of evidence that her investigation had uncovered. Reports from the Ordos regarding admissions of heresy, ties to the cell of Starlight Glimmer and Trixie Lulamoon, underground troop movements, and, most importantly, confirmation that the two heretics themselves would be there.\n\nGleefully wriggling on the seat, she glanced over at the large terrarium that rested against the window. Warm sunlight poured inside, reflecting off the dark scales of her pet. She smiled and declared, "This is the end for them, Snuggles!" The snake hissed back at her when it sensed her joy.\n\nHopping off the chair, she sauntered over and grabbed one of the mice that she kept nearby, just to keep him healthily hungry. As she floated it above the terrarium, she chortled, "The last major heretics have been revealed and just like that, we shall crush them!"\n\nHer magic flared brightly against the black fur of her face. In a series of pained squeaks, the mouse started to shrink and compress. With a sickening crunch, it went quiet and she dropped the flattened animal into the cage.\n\nAlmost instantly, Snuggles snatched it in his mouth and swallowed hole. He raised his head and stared back at her, flicking its tongue happily.\n\nHissing curiously, Snuggles tilted his head and Quasar tsked. "No, we mustn't let them know we're onto them. We shall station troops in preparation, but there will be some... collateral damage." She scoffed. "But that's acceptable in the Empress's service."\n\nShe spun around, heading toward the door. "Now, I believe I have an appointment with Blueblood." She blew a single kiss toward Snuggles, who tightened himself into a coil in the sun as the door slammed shut behind the Lady Inquisitor."
  solar.17.d_not_found:0 "Nervously, Lady Inquisitor Quasar Pulse adjusted the ring around her neck, which softly brushed against her black fur as she stared at the two imposing doors of Daybreaker's throne room.\n\nButterflies were fluttering in her stomach as she waited impatiently for the guards on either side of the doorway to allow her entrance. All around her, soldiers and servants were bustling through the corridor, which only further added to her nervousness.\n\nWrapped around her stomach and resting his head against her neck, her pet snake Snuggles worriedly hissed and peered up at her. Without saying a word, she patted his head a couple of times.\n\n"Lady Inquisitor," one of the ceremonial guards next to the door stated, "the Empress will see you now."\n\nWith that, they thrust the doors inward, their heavy mahogany creaking as they revealed the room within. Twin moats of lava lazily descended from the ceiling, leaving the entire room awash in heat that distorted the very air inside. Upon her throne, dozens of hoofsteps away, Daybreaker rested irately and tapped a hoof impatiently.\n\nWhen she saw Quasar, she motioned for her to enter, and Quasar obeyed. Once Quasar had performed the necessary genuflection, Daybreaker slowly got off the throne and stated, "Rise, Lady Inquisitor."\n\nQuasar did so, but remained quiet. Arching a brow, Daybreaker inquired, "You have news of the search?"\n\n"My Empress," Quasar began, anxiously swallowing and petting that infernal snake of hers. "The leads have... gone cold." Daybreaker narrowed her eyes.\n\n"There is nothing more we can do at this time. We—"\n\n"You were tasked with something SIMPLE, Lady Inquisitor!" Daybreaker barked as she stomped a hoof and caused her mane to flash a bright, hot blue. "Perhaps I was mistaken to give you this role?!"\n\nFlinching back, Quasar Pulse stuttered, "I-I apologize for the failure, but they went underground, and we are unable to—"\n\n"Enough excuses!" Daybreaker screamed as she stormed closer to Quasar. Leaning down and pressing her muzzle directly against Quasar's, she snarled. "Find them. Tear the entire Empire apart if you have to. I. Want. Them. Destroyed!"\n\nBeating her chest once in salute, Quasar rapidly dashed back out the throne room. Daybreaker watched her, rolling her eyes and scoffing as she sat back down on her seat and waved a hoof. "Bring the next pony. I trust they're more capable than she is.""

  solar.58.t:0 "Last Will and Testament"
  solar.58.d:0 ""Where is she? What is going on?" Daybreaker demanded as she stormed toward the closed wooden door near the end of the hallway in the Imperial Palace. The early morning sun peeked through the buildings in Sanctum Solar to dance upon her regalia.\n\nThe court physician, Clean Scalpel, slipped out of the room and quietly shut the door behind her. When she saw Daybreaker, she gave a small bow and she readjusted the small magnification lens that was over her right eye. "You received my message, I see."\n\n"Yes, yes," Daybreaker huffed, motioning for the doctor to continue. "You could have been less cryptic."\n\nTo her concern, Scalpel shuffled on her hooves and bit her lip. "I did not know how to word it, Empress." She sighed. "I've kept her comfortable, but I'm not sure how long that will keep her cogent." Cleaning her eyepiece with her smock, she added, "I'm sorry, Empress. She's simply too old."\n\nDaybreaker barely could hear the words as they left Scalpel's mouth as she pushed past the earth pony and burst into the room. Unlike what she was expecting, it was rather bright and cheery inside. Propped up against some pillows rested the wizened form of Raven Inkwell. The unicorn's grey mane still had streaks of brown in it, and she smiled when she saw Daybreaker.\n\n"My Empress," she declared, her voice slightly raspy. "You came."\n\n"What is the matter?" Daybreaker demanded, her chest tightening. Raven had been her assistant for more years than she could remember and never complained about the regime change. She had slowed recently, yes, but this was a new turn of events.\n\nSaying nothing, Raven merely sighed and leaned back. Shortly, she asked, "Do you remember what I said when you... first arrived?"\n\n"There was going to be a lot of paperwork to fill out," Daybreaker replied. Raven's sarcasm had been a nice break from the seriousness of the Empire. "And you were right."\n\n"I was, wasn't I?" Raven asked. A light titter escaped her throat, and she coughed. Weakly, she mumbled, "I'm sorry, my Empress, but I think—" she yawned "—I'll be leaving a bit more."\n\nAs Daybreaker approached, Raven breathed a couple of times and went limp. A single, scraping hiss of air escaped her mouth as Daybreaker reached forward to place her hoof on Raven's, tears staining the sheets beneath her muzzle."

  solar.59.t:0 "In Duty's Name"
  solar.59.d:0 "Startled, Dotted Quill jerked his head up and blinked away the grains of sleep that encrusted his eyelids. He was sleeping again, which ruined his chance at breaking his record of spending one hundred and fifteen hours awake of work. Unfortunately, categorizing healing spells and their reciprocal injury incantations was far from interesting.\n\nSomething had woken him, but he couldn't tell what. The Imperial Library in the lower levels of the palace were all but empty at this time of night. As far as he could tell, the only things here were himself and his books, and that was just right.\n\nStretching and cracking his back, he paused mid-movement when there was a growl and another thump as the sound of a heavy tome smacking the floor echoed through the room. He sprang up instantly, clicking his tongue when he noticed the splotch of ink on his chief scribe robes. That would take more than magic to scrub out.\n\nRegardless of the state of his clothes, he slunk through the aisles to where he believed the intruder resided. He caught a couple more scuffles followed by some irritated grunts, and then he turned a corner. "Aha!" he cried, prepping his horn a spell. He wasn't a battle mage, but he could still make somepony's life uncomfortable. "Take your hooves off the—\n\n"God-Empress?" he asked as Daybreaker, bleary-eyed, upset, and crying, glowered back at him. "What can I do for you?" He bowed, not out of fear, but because it was necessary. Plus keeping his job with all these books was a nice touch.\n\n"You, scribe," she snapped. "You have knowledge of this library. Where are the necromantic scrolls?"\n\nStaring at her blankly, he replied, "You had us destroy or hide them. But I could maybe give you some reference knowledge, if that's what you need." Holding up a hoof, he declared, "For instance, Viscera's Undead Compendium spoke of ways to keep your zombies well-fed, and Bloody Hemorrhage's Dictum on Dreadful Deeds provided new ghoulification techniques." He mumbled. "I need to find time to read that again."\n\nChuckling softly, she asked tiredly, "You seem to be a wealth of knowledge. And I assume you have good timekeeping skills?" Smirking as he nodded cautiously, she wiped at her nose and she stated, "Good, good. You remind me of her, in a way."\n\nAs she got up, she declared, "I believe I've found my newest court assistant." She patted him on the side of the shoulder before yawning. "I will return to my quarters. Your first assignment is at dawn."\n\nBlinking a couple times, Quill muttered, "Well, at least I didn't lose my job. Or my head.""

Nothing could harm the Empress permanently, could it?\n\nBut that was the answer that the group of inquisitors now knew. Daybreaker, at least in her current form was gone. All that was left was a husk that was perfectly preserved with some advanced magic spells on her throne. Somewhere, deep down, she was still there, but she was unable to move, feel, or act.\n\nIt was a solemn ceremony at first, but the Adoratio Primus was summoned by Sunset. All archmages, their second-in-commands, and some other important ponies from across the Empire soon arrived, and the debate began. Who would replace the Empress? Who would become regent?\n\nAn obvious choice was Sunset Shimmer, as she was Daybreaker's most trusted pony and head of the Solaris Cultus. However, other voices soon advocated for different options.\n\nAurora Shinespark was an alternative, as Sunset advocated for her from her experience on their attempt to save Daybreaker, and Aurora's zeal for seeing the Empire continue that she herself didn't have. But some, including Aurora's lieutenant Nova Glow and Lady Inquisitor Quasar Pulse claimed she had not enough experience.\n\nAs the hours dragged on, a fight almost broke out between two different archmages, who had to be thrown out for the time being.\n\nThere were so many voices. Somepony had to decide, and it had to be soon, before the Empire collapsed because of a slow bureaucratic argument.\n\nWho would it be?"
  solar.100.a:0 "Sunset Shimmer."

  ###Daybreaker Events###
  solar.101.t:0 "A Goddess Returned"
  solar.101.d:0 "Darkness enveloped Daybreaker. Suddenly, in a swirling mass of light, tendrils of pain pierced her skull, and a bright flash was followed by gasps of multiple ponies.\n\nWith a loud cough and hurried breathing, Daybreaker felt a massive weight lift off her shoulders. Her mind was muddled; it felt different. Empty. Celestia was gone. She was sure of it. Whatever Sunset had done to save her, it had worked, and she already started to feel livelier as the seconds ticked by.\n\n"Empress," the nervous voice of Sunset asked, "can you hear me?"\n\nGroaning and rolling one of her shoulders, Daybreaker sat up. She was drenched in sweat, she just realized, although it was quickly evaporating in the heat from her mane. Her room was in complete tatters, like a great blast of magical energy had gone off. Outside, shouts and gunshots echoed through the streets.\n\n"Empress," she heard Sunset inquire again.\n\nAs she opened her mouth to speak, Daybreaker snapped, "Yes, I can hear you!" Her mane rippled angrily for a second, and she hopped off her bed to nearly collapse to the floor as her legs gave out from under her.\n\nOnly because of the quick reaction of the two other ponies in the room—an inquisitor and a civilian—kept her from smacking face-first into the ground. As she was propped up, she shrugged them off and demanded, "What HAPPENED out there?!" She gestured to balcony in her chambers.\n\nPaling, Sunset cleared her throat and she uncomfortably stated, "The Empire is falling into chaos, God-Empress. Heretics took advantage of the situation and started—"\n\n"What." Daybreaker's brow furrowed as she glared at Sunset. How could things have gotten to be so?! The ponies nearest to her backed away as her fury peaked and her mane whipped into a blisteringly hot white-blue.\n\nWhile Sunset stammered to get her tongue back on track, Daybreaker snarled and spun toward the door. "Apparently I must handle everything! Summon the Adoratio Primus! Declare an emergency declaration from the crown! I do not care! This must be stopped, now!"\n\nStorming from the room, she slammed the semi-broken door on its hinges, and Sunset sighed before looking at one of the other inquisitors. "This is going swimmingly," she muttered as she started to trudge after Daybreaker."
  solar.101.a:0 "Is there nopony competent here?!"
  solar.102.t:0 "Prime Correction"
  solar.102.d:0 ""What do you think we were called here for?" Archmage Burning Plage inquired of the other archmages that were gathered around the large table. It had been months since the Adoratio Primus had been summoned, and it wasn't until next month that it should meet again.\n\n"I know not," Pulsar Sweep, the archmage of Fillydelphia's Ordo Apparatus, declared as she leaned forward. "But I was in the middle of interrogating an instigator when I suddenly was teleported here."\n\n"Oh, come on," Ion Trail whined. Leaning to the left in her seat, she lit her horn with a crackle and started to reach out for Iron Tail's flail that was fastened to her hip. "Can't we all just agree it's nice to see each other?"\n\n"If you continue your antics, Archmage Trail," Iron Tail snarled as she shot Ion Trail a side-eyed glance, "I will not be held responsible for what happens." With a couple of blinks, Ion Trail sat back up and the rest of the ponies there rolled their eyes.\n\nBefore anypony else could prattle about the latest news in their Ordo, the towering doors at the room's entrance burst open. As they both slammed against the wall, everypony gasped and bowed in their seats as Daybreaker marched into the room.\n\nShe was breathing heavily, and there was an unhealthy pallor to her complexion, but rage burned in her eyes. "Foals!" she hissed. When everypony remained quiet, she bellowed, "Imbeciles!"\n\nAs she heaved, Sunset and Aurora Shinespark slipped in beside her and took their own places. Sunset's expression was mixed with worry and nervousness.\n\nStomping, Daybreaker snarled, "You have let the Empire crumble before your eyes! What have you been doing?!" Her mane thrashed around her, scorching some of the wood of the doorframe.\n\nNopony answered her, which only caused her scowl to contort further.\n\n"Well?!" she demanded, some spittle flying from her mouth. When it remained silent, she huffed, "If it wouldn't COMPLETELY destabilize the Empire, I would have you all executed." She stomped. "You have ONE chance to fix your Ordos. Do not test my mercy!"\n\nGlowering again at the assembled archmages, she breyed and barged out of the room, leaving it totally quiet. Until there was a small zap followed by a yelp from Iron Tail.\n\nAs there was a blast of magic, Ion Trail exclaimed, "Worth it!""
  solar.102.a:0 "Nothing but idiots!"
  solar.103.t:0 "Begun, the Solar War, Has"
  solar.103.d:0 "With a swagger that she had missed these last few years, Daybreaker sauntered into the darkened room. There were no lights this deep into the palace, but that didn't matter to her. Only she was allowed this far into the heart of the Canterhorn mountains, anyway. Her vast collection of art, artifacts, weapons, and armor, were stored down here, protected from any prying eyes or enterprising thieves.\n\nIn lieu of actual lighting, her mane provided more than enough ambiance to reveal that she was in a small room filled with various armors. Some appeared to be ancient, others rather recent, and all were shaped to different ponies' sizes. She could have kept a small army supplied if needed, but thankfully that day never came.\n\nDirectly in front of her stood a mannequin with brilliant golden plating, perfectly designed for an alicorn. Sneering, she took the first piece and snapped it over her chest. Each piece clicked into place as she anticipated the next few hours.\n\nShe was done waiting. Every nation on Equus believed that the Empire was finished and a shadow of what had been in Equestria. But they were wrong. A burning inferno raged in her heart, swirling her emotions together to a slurry of anger that sometimes made her feel like she would explode into a fireball. And that wrath would soon be directed outwards, which only further drove her to the edge.\n\nAs the last piece of armor clicked on, she cackled, low at first, but soon into a pleased chortle.\n\nIn a flash, she teleported out and reappeared outside of the main war room, which she burst into with a deafening boom. Everypony she had assembled, Blueblood, Sunset, Quasar, and other top-ranking leaders were there. It was time.\n\n"My ponies," she began, as a quiver of excitement worked through her spine. "Let the Solaris Bellum commence!""
  solar.103.a:0 "Furor Sanctus!"
  solar.104.t:0 "Broken Barriers"
  solar.104.d:0 ""Faithful servants of the Empire! We are here to witness the perfection of the Inquisitionis in our time!" Daybreaker bellowed, her voice carrying through the throne room and over the softly roiling falls of lava. Assembled through most of room were a number of members of the Solaris Adoratio and Inquistionis. Some were excited, others... less than such.\n\nHowever, that concerned her little. With the impending wars on the horizon, every single pony was needed to perform their duties at peak condition. And since the Militarium was yet to actually do so, that left the Cultus to fill in the gaps.\n\nNot that there was much concern for that.\n\nStanding before her were around two dozen priestesses and inquisitors, with the Lady Inquisitor in front of them all. Meeting Quasar's gaze, she smirked as she saw the black-furred pony almost jiggling with anticipation.\n\n"The best, brightest, and strongest among you have agreed to lead our soldiers into battle. Some will not survive, but know that every pony who perishes for my, for the Empire's sake, will be forever remembered in this life, and rewarded in the next!"\n\nAs a small chant went out, Daybreaker proclaimed, "Service in life! Service in death! Sol Invictus!"\n\nShe presented each pony there with a small pin, which she placed on their cloaks. When she reached Quasar, she heard the unicorn mutter, "Their bones will be crushed! Heresy will be extinguished."\n\nWhen she saw Daybreaker, she beat her chest, and both she and Daybreaker declared in unison, "Sol Invictus!""
  solar.104.a:0 "Much better than Blueblood's oafs."
  solar.105.t:0 "Age of the Sun"
  solar.105.d:0 "Breathing deeply, Daybreaker closed her eyes as she heard the roars of the crowds gathered outside the Imperial Palace. They had come from all corners of the Empire for this moment after she had the declaration go out. The South-east had been neutralized and brought back into the fold. There were still some holdouts of resistance, but with fresh troops headed there now, they would soon be pacified entirely.\n\nWith a sigh of contentment, she tasted the palpable anticipation that hung in the air. The ponies outside were electric in their excitement, and she could subtly feel their innate magic playing off each other, which fed her own glee.\n\nFlanked on either side by a praetorian guard, she strode forward, toward the opening to the balcony. As she reached it, a pair of servants pulled aside the curtains and she blinked only once as the bright sun poured into her eyes. Thunderous cheers reached her ears as she stepped onto platform and she could see that the inner and outer courtyards were nearly bursting with the number of ponies assembled.\n\nSoon, the applause morphed into a chant of her name, and she waved a couple of times as a sneer broke out on her muzzle. She finally motioned for them to stop, and she bellowed, "Ponies of the Solar Empire! I stand before you today, at the height of our victory!\n\n"The insult that was suffered by Cobalt Hoof's arrogance has finally been erased! Our armies have marched through that blasted jungle wasteland and reclaimed it as our rightful land!"\n\nA few cheers broke out at that.\n\nSmiling, she boomed, some spittle flying from her mouth, "The Solar Empire has returned, stronger than ever! Our resolve is resolute! Our devotion is unmatched! The heretics, apostates, communists, and bugs will FEAR us! For with the might of the sun behind us, nothing can hold us from our destiny!"\n\nThrusting forth a hoof, she powered her horn and sent energy surging through the sun itself. In seconds, the whole land brightened, and ponies roared in approval as she cried, "The Solar Empire will conquer all! Sol Invictus! SOL INVICTUS!""
  solar.105.a:0 "We will not be stopped!"
  solar.106.t:0 "Spare Not the Rod"
  solar.106.d:0 "Quasar Pulse jittered excitedly. In her magic, she held a small number of reports from the newly retaken territory around the Solar Empire. The so-called rump states, or as some outside the Empire referred to them, "The Free States of Equestria."\n\nConquering them had been easy, but so far occupation had taken up far more resources than either the Solaris Cultus or the Militarium had anticipated. Of course, SHE had predicted as much. Generations of ponies had lived without proper fear of the Empress, and they accordingly required much... correction.\n\nShe cackled as she wove through the halls and eventually ended up in front of the throne room. Nodding to the two door guards, she was soon ushered in and announced, which caused Daybreaker to look up and dismiss some ponies who were near her.\n\nAs the advisors slowly filtered out, Quasar resisted the urge to break into a rictus grin. When they were finally gone, she tittered and exclaimed, "Oh! I have such exciting news, my Empress."\n\n"Do you?" Daybreaker inquired, barely keeping a hint of both annoyance and boredom from her voice. "Enlighten me."\n\nWith no further prompting, Quasar quickly teleported with a small "pompf" from where she stood to reappear next to Daybreaker. Daybreaker simply sighed and turned her head to face Quasar, arching a brow when she saw how elated Quasar appeared to be.\n\nQuasar cleared her throat and scratched the back of her neck from the heat in the room. "All five regions report heavy resistance, my Empress." She held up a hoof. "And the Militarium reports that it cannot keep them at bay with their current stance of occupation."\n\nFlatly gazing at Quasar for a moment, Daybreaker finally asked, "That's good news?"\n\n"Yes!" Quasar exclaimed, which almost caused Daybreaker to nicker in surprise. When she regained some composure, she stated, "Because we now have impetus to crack down." She quaveringly inhaled. "Harshly." She hissed some of the air out between her teeth.\n\n"We can imprison them, torture them, crush them, execute them, burn them, all in the name of restoring order!" She cackled. "And rooting out heresy, of course." Steadying her breath, she added, "I highly recommend it."\n\nMomentarily scratching her chin, Daybreaker eyed Quasar and hummed. Soon, though, the edges of her muzzle raised up in a sneer, and soon the two began to chortle in glee."
  solar.106.a:0 "I've always anticipated this moment."
  solar.107.t:0 "A Velveted Hoof of Iron"
  solar.107.d:0 ""Empress, High Mage Shimmer is here to see you," one of the guards outside Daybreaker's throne room declared as Sunset was ushered into middle of the area.\n\nThe gold of her robe reflected the afternoon sun, and Daybreaker smiled as she was surprised by her oldest servant. In some ways, she could even be a friend.\n\nPlacing some reports and schematics down on the small table beside the throne, Daybreaker stepped off and she declared, "My faithful servant! I was not expecting your arrival." She motioned for Sunset to come closer, and she could see that there was something bothering the unicorn.\n\nPursing her lips, Daybreaker gently probed Sunset's thoughts with her magic. As she was being careful, she couldn't quite make anything out, but she could still sense the unease that had been part of her since the whole ordeal with Celestia. Hopefully it wasn't related to that.\n\nAs she got close, Sunset went through the motions, bowing and stating, "My Empress."\n\n"Rise," Daybreaker replied, rotating a fetlock and holding back a yawn. "You needn't do that, my faithful servant. You have sacrificed enough to earn that much."\n\nSunset blushed for a second, then she cleared her throat. "I wanted to be blunt," she grunted as she swished her tail. "It's not... the best right now in the new territories."\n\n"Yes, I know," Daybreaker replied with a nod, which got a resigned sigh from Sunset. "But the Militarium is handling things well enough, last I was informed. There is nothing to worry about."\n\n"That's it! If we keep leaving all our soldiers there, it's not going to earn us any favors with everypony there!" Sunset exclaimed, her jewelry jangling as she gesticulated for a moment. "I know that there are ponies who are fighting you, but there are a lot who just want to be left alone!"\n\nShe shrugged. Muttering tiredly, she pressed a hoof against the bridge of her nose, and she stated, "We just don't have the troops to commit to a full cleansing, and this right now is making us less popular. Maybe if we..."\n\n"We do not execute every heretic," Daybreaker finished. When Sunset bobbed her head, Daybreaker sighed. "I will heed your logic, but the details are mine alone." She frowned. "Am I clear?" She already had a few ideas of how this could work."

  solar.108.d:0 ""Damn them to Tartarus!" Luna cursed as she led a group of ponies through one of the tight streets of the Crystal City. Her sister's forces had assaulted hours earlier, and while the Crystal Army did its best to repel them, there was little stopping soldiers pushed onward by Daybreaker herself.\n\nNow it was simply a matter of evacuating as many as could leave the city, but routes were rapidly shriveling up as the Solaris Militarium surrounded it. One of the best avenues she and Twilight had was now blockaded by a number of trucks that were unloading Daybreaker's cronies.\n\nShifting around to glance at Twilight, who was shoring up the rear of the hundred or so ponies they were leading, Luna was about to cry out when there was a blast of fire from one of the crystal houses on their right.\n\nThe group screamed as they dove for the ground, and Luna flung up a shield to protect them from the pelting debris. As she lowered it, her eyes widened when she saw a dark figure illuminated from the glow. A low, maniacal cackle started to bounce around the street, and Luna muttered, "No."\n\n"Oh, my sweet SISTER," Daybreaker giggled as she left the flames. Pouting, she asked, "Aren't you pleased to see me?"\n\nLuna's blood froze as she heard Twilight whimper from behind her. Holding out a wing to motion Twilight up, Luna snarled, "We would never be pleased to see thee, foul monster!" Her horn began to build up a charge of blue energy, and Daybreaker yawned as she saw it.\n\n"How droll," Daybreaker mused as her own horn lit with a blood red glow. Instead of targeting Luna, she hurled three beams of energy at Twilight, who was still too stunned to properly dodge. They knocked her to the ground, unconscious.\n\nAs Luna's heartbeat began to build, Daybreaker sneered. "Oh, you don't know how much I've been looking forward to our little reunion, Lulu," she cackled. " We have so, so much to catch up on.""

  solar.109.d:0 "A bellowing explosion ripped through the streets of Vesalipolis as a pair of fighters crashed into the ground. Sirens screamed their warnings as hailstorms of shells rained from the sky while the besieging Imperial soldiers waited patiently to move in.\n\nFor hours, the megapolis had been bombarded, with its own defensive positions firing back upon the invaders. But it was of little use as the Solaris Militarium began to pick apart cells of resistance from afar.\n\nEventually, the divisions had moved in and swarmed through the streets, ironically like the changelings that were so reviled within in Solar Empire itself. Bursts of gunfire mixed with occasional whines and chirps of magical energy weapons had echoed throughout the city as the two sides clashed in a frenzy to eke out victory for their side.\n\nIn the midst of it all, Daybreaker had led her personal forces toward the royal palace in the center of the city. The insectoid spires that were a hallmark of changeling architecture had been toppled in the earlier bombardment and left rubble throughout the passages leading to the palace.\n\nFighting was fierce, but in time Daybreaker's forces had battered the entrance to the palace down with explosives and fanned out into the labyrinthine structure.\n\nStalking through the halls, Daybreaker twitched an ear when she heard scurried hoofbeats approaching them. She rolled her shoulders as she motioned for her guards to take up ready positions wherever they could find areas of cover.\n\nIn only a few seconds, about two dozen changelings geared for combat barreled into the hall, followed up in the rear by the creature that Daybreaker sought. Queen Chrysalis, her chitin chipped and faded in sections, froze when she laid eyes upon Daybreaker.\n\nDaybreaker sneered. No words needed to be expressed as the two enemies stared at each other.\n\nFinally, Chrysalis screamed at the confused changelings protecting her, "Don't just stand there! Fire! Fire!" She retaliated with her own blast of magic, which Daybreaker quickly deflected with a shield spell.\n\nAs Chrysalis's shot dug through a wall of the palace, Daybreaker chuckled and she moved in like a predator stalking its next meal. There would be no escape."

"Everypony out!" she ordered, which got confused looks from the various guards and advisors currently in session with Daybreaker.\n\n"Out!" Sunset demanded again. Despite some protests, they filtered out after Daybreaker adjourned the session early.\n\nSome of the afternoon sun passed through her mane as she approached Sunset, making it appear an even brighter flare than it already was. Although her face was neutral, Sunset knew that Daybreaker was not impressed.\n\nTherefore, in order to at least get a word in edgewise before the inevitable tongue-lashing, she snapped, "What is THIS?!" She held up a piece of paper, sealed with Daybreaker's stamp. On it, it detailed when, where, and why more of the Solaris Cultus would be utilized.\n\n"It is quite simple, my faithful servant," Daybreaker replied with a tired sigh. "It is their duty." She flicked her mane to the side, which cast off a couple blobs of molten material.\n\n"Do you WANT the ponies who focus on enforcing things killed off?" Sunset probed. She threw the paper to the ground. "Because that's how you do it!"\n\n"And you think I do not know this?" Daybreaker asked in a mockingly surprised tone. She clicked her tongue derisively. "Surely you understand me better, Sunset."\n\nFace turning red, Sunset gave a furious groan and gestured wildly. "You could at least have consulted with me first. Since you put me in charge of the stupid cult!"\n\nAt that, Daybreaker's muzzle twisted into a scowl and she strode up to Sunset. Placing her nose against Sunset's, she stated calmly and coldly, "You are the head of the Solaris Cultus because I wish it. It is still mine to command. If I tell them to die, they die where I want it and when. If they live, they do so through my protection. Is. That. Clear?"\n\n"Yes," Sunset finally replied as she pulled back and looked away. Huffing, she puffed out her cheeks and stepped back.\n\nReturning to her throne, Daybreaker retorted, "Go. I do not wish for more interruptions today." She shook her head as Sunset stalked out the doors."

  solar.111.d:0 "Stellar Breeze winced as she watched the pony that had been laid before Daybreaker dragged out by their hindlegs. Frantically screaming for mercy, their cries were soon deafened by the sound of the slamming doors of the throne room's entrance.\n\nSweat rolled the back of her neck, which was quickly evaporated by the heat of the lava that lined both sides of the room. "I suppose that's one more to check off," she mumbled softly to herself as she lifted a quill and scratched the poor pony's name off with a sigh.\n\nSince Daybreaker had returned, she had been adamant that her schedule be bumped up significantly. She had missed months of court, after all, and she had to make up for it. Normally, Chief Scribe Dotted Quill would handle this, but he was recovering from a horn injury, and Sunset had her own problems to deal with.\n\nThus, she was now the Empress's chosen replacement. That one short stint she had a few months prior to all the craziness must have kept her in Daybreaker's mind. Whenever she thought about that, she shuddered.\n\n"Guilty!" Daybreaker barked, rapping a hoof heavily on the golden armrest that was on her throne. As she did, the stallion that had been thrown before her blubbered and begged, although Daybreaker simply waved him away. "Next!" she snapped.\n\n"And another," Stellar muttered under her breath. Scratch one more life off the list.\n\nAs another pony was tugged inside, Stellar gulped as she saw it was a mare around her age, perhaps a smidgen younger. The purply pegasus gazed pleadingly at her, eyes locking until the mare was shoved to the ground.\n\nSnarling, Daybreaker raised her left lip and she flashed her fangs. "You have been accused of treason, insurrection, and blasphemy." She snorted. "Serious crimes, but I shall allow you to speak." Barely audible, she added, "If only to let you dig your grave deeper."\n\nAs soon as she was able to talk, the pegasus started to sputter, "Empress, I-I don't know why I'm here! I was just part of a crowd outside the castle and then—"\n\n"Enough of your lies!" Daybreaker barked, which made Stellar and the mare wince. "You were in the riots! You are nothing but a heretic!" She stomped. "Guilty! Take her away!"\n\nAs the guards obeyed, she looked over at Stellar. Stellar scratched the pegasus off the list, and she huffed, "That is all, your majesty."\n\n"Find me another."\n\n"Sorry?" Stellar's stomach churned as Daybreaker glowered at her.\n\n"Find me another, or the next pony before me will be you." Daybreaker furrowed her brow as Stellar started to hastily make a retreat. "Heresy is everywhere, after all.""

  solar.115.d:0 "Clutching his rifle tightly, Churned Waves shivered as water splashed over the sides of the transport ship. Shells from artillery batteries whistled overhead, which only added to the lurching of the ship as it beat through the choppy surf. They were only another minute out. He could already make out staccato gunfire from the squads that had already landed.\n\nThe smell of oil filled his nose, and the choking engine struggled to finish its task. Some stray bullets from a Marelandian fighter flyby punctured one of the twin engines and damaged it, and some of the soldiers had been nursing it along to keep them afloat.\n\nForcing his chattering teeth to stop, he glanced nervously over at the nearest pony to him. The young mare looked just as terrified as he felt. It wasn't supposed to be like this. They were supposed to just land and take the beach. Nopony said it'd be through hell like this!\n\nAs if taunting him, another round of bullets, this time from shore, punched through the walls of the transport. His comrades screamed, and he felt the spray of warm blood land on his muzzle. Opening his eyes, the mare beside him lay limp in her seat, crimson gushing from her forehead.\n\nBefore he even had time to vomit, the ship ground to a halt and the bay door slammed open. Sand blasted his face, and he heard his CO shout, "Go! Die for your Empress!"\n\nFreezing just a moment, he stared at the dead mare one more time before somepony cried, "Watch out!" A screaming whizz of an artillery shell descended and he was launched through the air as it impacted just behind the boat. Rolling a couple of times, he got to his hooves and charged, adrenaline and emotions taking over any logical thought.\n\nBefore he got even a dozen feet forward, searing pain ripped through his right shoulder and he collapsed in agony. Around him he heard screams, and he thought of his comrades as consciousness started to slip away.\n\nAs his world went black, he saw a set of white hooves and an orange glow move further inland, and somepony crying his name through a muffled ring."

  solar.116.d:0 ""Go, go, go!" Steel Buckler ordered as she aimed down her pistol sights at a couple of fleeing Marelandians. She popped off two shots, and both conscripts fell to the ground, dead.\n\nFires raged throughout the city of Sunset, at least, as it was known in Imperial Records. There was no indication that it even had a name to MARESOC. She heard a few ponies say it was just called "The City," but even that was apocryphal.\n\nHer troops were part of the special insertion to take the square outside the Ministries, and she could hear some whines of magical weaponry as other squads burst through Marelandian barricades. Apparently, the orders to keep the buildings intact came directly from the Empress, but Buckler was damned to why it'd be the case.\n\nThe only fate those buildings deserved were immediate detonation. Preferably with every heretic inside.\n\nSlowly working their way through the damaged streets, her soldiers picked off enemies where they could to clear the way for the main forces. When they reached the square of the Ministries, she paused, assessed the area, and then radioed with the other divisions.\n\nAfter a couple of minutes, there was a small buzz of engines, and four Imperial fighters soared overhead. A stream of napalm emptied from their bellies, which covered the majority of the defenders before it ignited.\n\nUrging her troops forward, she charged past the writhing bodies and capped one or two that tried to shoot at her in the head. The two tanks that were left were currently on fire, but the napalm would burn off. She and one other member of her squad grabbed some explosives and tossed them onto the chasses. A moment later, both were hunks of scrap, and she breathed a sigh.\n\nDirectly ahead was the Ministry of "Truth," the insane propaganda division of MARESOC. Its imposing, featureless concrete height towered far above any other structure, save for the other Ministry buildings at each cardinal direction in the square.\n\nSuddenly, there was a squawk on her radio, and she received new orders. They would be going in to search for any Party leaders. Didn't sound hard, but before she could comply, she was knocked off her hooves.\n\nAs the rest of her squad got up, she felt her ears ring and she shook her head. Gasping, she watched as the front of the Ministry building sank inward. They'd blown it up! The fools had done it!\n\nBut then she had her orders reiterated. They were still going in, whether they wanted to or not."

  solar.117.d:0 "Daybreaker tsked as she entered the square of the Ministries. Flames licked up from the burnt husks of Marelandian soldiers, which caused the atmosphere to have a heady, acrid scent to it. But she didn't care. She was one step closer to victory.\n\nWith the principal city taken, it'd only be a matter of time before Marelandia fell, yet she still had to send a further message. Maybe her soldiers would find nopony of worth, but maybe some of MARESOC's inner party were still in the city. If they were alive in those cursed buildings, they'd be found.\n\nShe sneered when she saw the collapsed entrance to Minitru. A small tunnel had been dug open by her soldiers and she could hear some intermittent gunfire echo out.\n\nEach building must have had failsafe devices built in, because they all were in various states of destruction. Bomb blasts had been recorded in the area, but it wasn't until she could see it with her own eyes that she believed the Marelandians were so suicidal as to decapitate their government to keep it out of the enemy's hooves.\n\nAs she waited, she kicked at one of the bodies near her, and then she heard some labored breathing emerge from Minitru.\n\n"Empress, we found somepony," a dirtied mare declared as she and about half a dozen bloodied soldiers emerged from the ruins. They dragged with them an older stallion who wore a battered pair of spectacles.\n\nThrowing him onto the ground, the mare stated, "He's one of them, Empress." She kicked him in the gut, which only got a small grunt from him. He glared up at Daybreaker with contempt before spitting on the ground.\n\nShe wasn't sure what to expect from an Inner Party member, but it appeared that fear was not going to be one of them.\n\n"Don't expect me to beg for mercy, fascist pig," he snapped, which caused her to chuckle. "The Party will never fail. Already we're winning on other fronts!"\n\n"So, you admit that you've lost," Daybreaker snorted. Grabbing him by his short mane, she snarled, "You won't have to worry what's true for much longer." Surging energy through her magic, she toothily grinned as his face ignited into flame."

The first sunk into a crater that surfaced randomly, the next was burnt to the ground by stray lightning. Each successive settlement counters for the last, but suffers something new.\n\nHowever, as of late, the Everfree Forest has grown calmer again.

Our architects assure us that they have finally account for all probabilities of nature, and that it is safe to settle the region.

It was watching her.\n\nTears stained her cheeks as she held back a few sobs. Why did Smooth Moss have to explore beyond the creek? She had warned him that there was nothing good beyond there. Not even the town guards ventured near there, as it was nothing but thick forest and whatever cursed chaos magic inhabited the land.\n\nShe had heard him scream only a few minutes later, and then the howling. The blasted howling that signaled the forest's rage.\n\nLambasting herself for not going back and checking for him, she continued to run away from the creek. Some cries for help filtered up from the small group of buildings ahead of her, and her heart assaulted her ribs as she saw three timberwolves pounce on one of the guards up ahead.\n\nShe didn't even pause to try and help as she heard crunching bone and rent flesh. Whimpering, more tears trickling down her face, she burst into town to see that more timberwolves were breaking down doors and dragging ponies out to devour them.\n\nOn instinct, she ran to her house, only to be blocked as a massive vine punched through the ground to then skewer through her small abode's front window. Seconds later, more protruded and entangled the building before constricting and crushing it.\n\nBlinking in shock, she heard a couple of ponies scream, "Run! Run! Empress save us!"\n\nShe only took one look, saw a mare trip and her husband try to help her up before they were pounced upon, before she bolted from the square. Dashing and weaving through the dozen or so streets, she almost reached the path leading out of town, when she gulped as some trees started to contort and move closer.\n\nAs howls from the timberwolves followed after her, she swallowed again and sprinted. Lungs feeling like they were burning up, she barely dove through the hole in the trees before it slammed shut.\n\nWiping at her nose, she limped away as screams from the settlement slowly faded out.

Blinking back a couple of tears, she winced and rubbed her neck as she attempted to straighten herself and see where exactly she was. When she did, she grunted as chains wrapped around her torso tightened as it was attached to somewhere that was barely visible.\n\nIt was dank, dark, and smelled like a dozen or so slowly starving changelings. Her throat constricted as she forced back some bile that threatened to worm its way up at the stench. Outside she could hear some muffled shouts, and as she strained to peer out the barred window of her jail, she heard the noise of an engine turning off.\n\nA number of hooves hit the ground outside and clanking armor worked its way over to another side of the cell. Suddenly, her left was washed in bright light, and she recoiled away and hissed.\n\n"Get out, insect," a gruff mare's voice demanded, which caused Chrysalis to bristle. She could see that her guess was correct, and good number of wounded changelings, one or two she recognized from her cabinet, were stuck in there with her. She was the only one awake.\n\nWithout warning there was a jolt of pain through her horn as the guard outside snapped, "I said, out!"\n\n"You dare order... a queen?!" she huffed before another brand of agony worked down her head.\n\n"You're no queen of me," the mare snorted back, and a couple more guards hopped in, unlatched her chain from the floor, and dragged her outside.\n\nWhen her eyes adjusted to the light, her heart sunk as she saw ahead of her a number of stakes erected in a massive pile of wood. Overhead, Daybreaker stood on her palace's balcony overlooking the crowd, and she stared at Chrysalis.\n\nThe speech was grand. Changelingia was destroyed. The oppression of the changelings was over. The Empire was free. If she was a pony, Chrysalis would have been proud. But instead, she was the object of derision, and while ponies jeered at her, she glared defiantly up at Daybreaker.\n\n"And you ponies claim that I was the monster!" she shouted, loud enough for most to hear. "Changelingia will never die! I hope to see you all in Tartarus!" It was not long before the flames were licking at her chitin, yet she didn't once cry in pain as she slipped from consciousness."

Scorched Earth has criticized the other generals for their slow deliberations, and today he has taken action.\n\nAlthough he's normally stationed in Mareway and the surrounding region in Ordo Maris, he and his army, the seventh Holy Flame, have departed for the South-east. With him is one of archmage Ion Trail's inquisitors, who has taken to lambasting her fellow sisters as complacent.\n\nScorched Earth's intentions are clear, and while we could attempt to stop him, it does present an opportunity.

"And just when I thought we were away," he pushed himself back up to see what was going on.\n\nThe procession of his army was going smoothly, until they apparently were ambushed. At this point, given they were near the border to the fractured South-east, it could have been equally communist sympathizers or some of his "fellow" Militarium members.\n\nAs another couple of shots rang out, and he spotted some bullets plink off some of the motorcade, he furrowed his brow when he caught a flash of white military uniform. They'd found him.\n\n"Damn it!" he exclaimed as he grabbed the radio transmitter in the armored car. Tuning it to their private frequency, he ordered, "All motorized, evasive action and double-time it! We won't be stopped now!" As he finished, a couple more potshots bounced off his car's hood and he grabbed his pistol from its holster to start firing into the trees lining the road of the trail.\n\nSoon his motorcade picked up speed, but there was a sudden thump as a cyan-blue unicorn landed on the hood. The driver swerved to try and get her off, and he cursed, "Ion Trail! You have one chance! I don't need any more blood spilled!"\n\nHer horn crackled with electricity, and she narrowed her eyes as she steadied and then hopped to the side to try and slip in. Before she could retort with anything, he started to raise his pistol, but Luminous Blade beat him to it. She hissed, "Apologies, Archmage." Swiveling the hilt of her sword around, she cracked Ion Trail in the jaw with the butt of it and Ion Trail was knocked out car, stunned.\n\nAs Ion Trail rebounded off, the motorcade picked up more speed, and soon the majority of the army was out of the ambush.

She had grabbed about fifty of her best soldiers and moved on ahead of the remainder of Ordo Maris's forces to surprise the general. He might have been a bit difficult to find at first, but given that this forest was one of the only ways into the South-east without infringing on other rogue states, it was easy to set up for an ambush.\n\nShe didn't expect it to stop the procession, but she did expect it to at least surprise the seventh Holy Flame and therefore give her opportunity. She only needed one.\n\nAs if like clockwork, about half a dozen shots rang out from some of her soldiers positioned behind cover. Within seconds, it looked like Scorched Earth had ordered them all to retreat, like she expected he would. That would mean that he'd be coming within jumping distance soon.\n\nIn anticipation, her horn sparked a couple of times, and when the car carrying him approached, she readied her hindlegs and then sprang forward. He was distracted because of the random shots he was firing into the tree cover, but he quickly whirled to see her on the car's hood.\n\nAs the driver tried to throw her off, she caught him say, "Ion Trail! You have one chance! I don't need any more blood spilled!"\n\nAt that, she snorted and sent more energy through her horn. If he was sincere, he wouldn't have done this to begin with.\n\nShe steadied herself, then galloped and twisted in to the cabin. At the last second, she spotted his lackey, Luminous Blade prepare to butt with the bottom of her sword's hilt. Ion Trail was faster, and she discharged her horn to zap Blade and leave her stunned.\n\nThat was all the time needed. Before Scorched Earth could react, she pushed forward, tackled him, and sent him and the driver sprawling on the dirt road. They rolled about a dozen times before she kicked the driver off and then fastened her grip around Scorched Earth.\n\nAs she sent a jolt of electricity through him to keep him dazed, she quipped with a snicker, "Hope you like heat, Earthy, because you're going to be feeling some REAL soon."\n\nHe sighed and watched as his army flee to their demise."

What had her diet been doing while she was... waylaid?\n\n"And Twilight Sparkle's castle in Ponyville has seen activity again, your majesty," Daybreaker heard one of her servants say, which caused her to halt in her tracks.\n\n"What?" she snapped, her voice low and threatening.\n\nWhimpering, the mare replied, "Archmage Sickle has reported renewed activity in the area, and she requested Militarium backup and economic investment a month prior, and—" She squeaked when Daybreaker's mane ignited into a hot blue, and she stumbled back a few paces.\n\nSoftly and irately, Daybreaker snarled, "All of you, go. Now!" She shot one glower at Dotted Quill, and he hurriedly shooed the entourage away.\n\nAlone, Daybreaker stalked to her room, her two praetorian guards saluting as entered and slammed her doors. She took one look at the new mirror that was hanging on the wall, and she screamed.\n\nVision turning red, she charged at it and smashed her forehooves into it with enough force to eject the glass in one blow. As the razor-thin pieces scratched along her face, she bellowed, "Stupid, stupid, stupid!"\n\nThose idiots that formed her inner circle couldn't keep the Empire together for five minutes without her! There was no way she could count on them to keep it stable once the Solaris Bellum was underway! There was only one option she could take. It would be exhausting, but she could handle it. For her ponies' sake.\n\nAfter a few more growls, smashes, and kicks, she finally worked out enough of her rage that she was able to breathe somewhat normally. Pushing the door to her room open, she stared at one of her guards.\n\n"Call Sunset Shimmer here, immediately!" she barked and returned inside. A moment later, she popped out and declared, "And inform my diet they're under arrest for incompetence!""

  solar.127.d:0 "As evening descended on Sanctum Solar, Sunset Shimmer trotted down one of the side halls of the Imperial Palace. It was remarkable, given how rapidly the city had managed to recover. If it weren't still in ponies' collective memory, there very idea of the Empire almost collapsing would have been considered preposterous.\n\nSwallowing slowly, she squeezed her eyes tight and shivered as she visualized Celestia again. A thick lump formed in her throat, and she sniffed once before she carried on.\n\nShe paused when she saw the figure up ahead. Silhouetted in the crimson glow from the sunset, Daybreaker gazed out upon the city, her face expressionless and her mane flowing softly and calmly. Although Sunset would have been within her periphery, Daybreaker didn't indicate she had noticed her underling.\n\nBiting her lip, Sunset approached her and gave a small bow. "My Empress," she stated formerly. Under her breath, she asked, "What are you doing here by yourself?"\n\n"I could ask you the same question, Sunset Shimmer," Daybreaker replied almost instantly, although she didn't glance toward Sunset.\n\nScuffing a hoof on the floor, Sunset fidgeted as the seconds dragged on. Daybreaker continued to ignore her, only occasionally darting her gaze between different nexuses of activity in the city. Before she could speak, however, Daybreaker snarled, "They wasted the Empire without me."\n\n"What?" Sunset asked as she folded her ears back.\n\n"The fools who claimed they would rule in my stead if I was injured wasted every opportunity they could!" Daybreaker slammed a hoof on the ground. "If I had truly perished, what would have happened? Would they let the nation crumble to dust?!"\n\n"Somepony would have—"\n\nGrowling and lowering her voice, Daybreaker interjected, "No. Nopony would." The pregnant pause that followed caused Sunset to wilt and step away. Daybreaker's mane transformed into a thrashing inferno of purple and blue, and she hissed, "So they do not deserve that responsibility. Nopony does. None but me."\n\nAt that, she pursed her lips and went silent.\n\nWhen she refused to speak further, Sunset sighed and trudged away. Daybreaker gave her one scornful look as she disappeared down the hall."

  solar.128.d:0 ""No! No, no, no!"\n\nFat Stacks, son of Thick Stacks, grandson of Large Stacks, great-grandson of Respectable Stacks, darted through one of the many hallways of the Imperial Palace. Servant and soldier alike jumped out of the way, one maid moving so fast that her bucket of water she was using with her mop sloshed and splashed him with sudsy muck.\n\nSpluttering and gagging a couple of times, Fat Stacks didn't even bother to stop and berate her. Normally that was one of his favorite pastimes, but today was entirely different.\n\nWhy did that sun have to be so cursedly hot? It beat down on him through the glass panes of the exterior wall, which only added to his misery.\n\nSoon, he reached the destination he was seeking. Two praetorian guards attempted to stop him as he barreled through the unlocked doors of Daybreaker's room and sprawled on the floor. He gave a squishy "oof" as the wind was knocked from him.\n\nSurprised, Daybreaker was about to speak when Fat Stacks interrupted, his words spilling out of him as the guards hoist him up. "Please! I want to stay here! I've done nothing but serve you! You can't just end me like this! PLEASE!" he blubbered, which made Daybreaker furrow her brow.\n\nPlacing down the quill she had been writing with, she sighed. "I don't even know who you are." She motioned for the guards to release him.\n\n"F-Fat Stacks, your excellency," he said as he bowed. "I am a humble servant, who wishes to remain in your good—"\n\n"Good graces?" Daybreaker finished for him, which got a vigorous nod. Chuckling, she declared, "How quaint. I was not planning for you to be part of the purges, but..." As she trailed off, she flicked her wing to the guards again.\n\nIn an instant, they snatched him up, and he screamed, "Wait! No!"\n\n"I cannot be interrupted by useless ponies such as yourself," she stated as she sat back in front of her desk. "Congratulations, Fat Stacks, you have volunteered to be the first of this purge.""

Unfortunately, it is something much graver than that, for it was not anything that we anticipated.\n\nYour ultimatum to your expanded advisory council has been taken to heart, perhaps a tad too well. The entrepreneurs, Flim and Flam, believed they could manufacture a better spell matrix and use it to improve our MAR weaponry with higher yields, if at the cost of slightly less reliability. They failed to mention just HOW unreliable they would become.\n\nAfter one by the name of Flat Mallet bumped a box of the newest matrices, the combination of the tiny crystals congealed in just a way the thaumatic ley lines converged to create a singularity. When Lord Commander Blueblood ordered some of his new shock troops to charge in and restore order, their MAGs were suctioned up from their belts, which added to the singularity.\n\nWith the increased mass, the singularity detonated, which for the lucky ones, instantly vaporized them, but left others to perish painfully. Approximately one-third of a square mile around the manufactory has been completely leveled and the Militarium is currently assessing damages and loss of life.\n\nAs a side note: we must speak further with Flim and Flam.

And she was furious.\n\nScorch marks dotted the walls of the recently repaired room, the small fountain in the middle that provided a calming atmosphere still devoid of any moving water. A pair of praetorian guards, their armor clanking together slightly as they shifted to stare at the group of ponies, stood at attention on either corner, near large bay windows that overlooked the southern portion of the city.\n\n"Sit," Daybreaker growled, her mane thrashing and lobbing a small globule of molten fire against the wall. It sizzled as it faded away to leave charred stonework behind.\n\nEverypony glanced between each other. Daybreaker was never this harsh before. What had set her off?\n\n"I ordered you to SIT," Daybreaker repeated as an animalistic tone took over and she glowered daggers at all of them.\n\nNot wishing to face the ire of her, they quickly fell into their allotted seats before they anxiously exchanged another series of looks of confusion. To their chagrin, Daybreaker continued to let them stew for a moment, although it didn't stop her from frowning at them.\n\nWithout warning, she shot a fireball from her horn that narrowly avoided a pair of advisors, and she screamed, "Imbeciles! All of you!" She heaved and her face contorted into a vicious scowl. "You are supposed to run the Empire in my stead, and what do I find?!\n\n"A nation in ruin, the populace frightened, and a cabal of the 'best and brightest' of my Empire sitting around with horns up their rectums!" Daybreaker coughed, but the fury remained in her eyes.\n\n"R-Really, my Empress, I must protest!" a stallion, Sharp Rhetoric, exclaimed. "W-We simply had so—ack!"\n\nIn a lightning move, Daybreaker yanked him forward in her magic, and crashed him down on the table in front of her. Applying extreme pressure, to the point that a couple of his bones began to crack, she hissed, "Do. Not. Speak." She looked up. "From this point forward, you will do what I say, when I say, and how I say. Your advice is useless, but you are still useful." She released Rhetoric and he whimpered. "Pray you stay that way.""

  solar.131.d:0 ""WHAT?!" Quasar Pulse demanded as one of her lower mages informed her of the news. She hissed as Snuggles bit at her hoof for food before she put him back on his perch.\n\nAnxiously shifting back and forth, the mare stated, "The speculatore confirmed it, Lady Inquisitor." She coughed into a hoof and glanced to the door. "I must get back to my duties, but I believed that you should know."\n\nFor once, Quasar was completely without words. She had spent her entire time as the Lady Inquisitor doing whatever Daybreaker demanded of her. Not only that, she went out of her way to implement special purges, just to show Daybreaker that she truly was loyal and loved her with all of her heart. And now Daybreaker was considering inspecting the Inquisitionis?!\n\nSitting down at her desk for a moment, she rubbed the welt that was growing from Snuggles' nervous nip. Her mind bounced around as she tried to parse what was told to her, but she couldn't believe it. Within moments, her chest tight and throat dry, she pushed up and huffed, "I will have to confirm this myself."\n\nHurriedly bursting out of her office, she stormed down the hallways toward the throne room. Everypony who saw her cleared extra space for her, as her complexion was clouded in worry and anger. Reaching the throne room's doors, she snapped as the guards attempted to stop her, "Move aside, idiots! I will speak with the Empress."\n\nAs she thrust through the doors, she cried, "God-Empress! I must speak with you, now!" She curtsied as Daybreaker noticed her, but she held back a growl.\n\nLazily complying, Daybreaker waved the few nobles that were in the room to depart. When they were gone, Quasar approached the alicorn and she demanded, "What is the meaning of this?! The Inquisitionis is pure! We do not—"\n\n"I do not have time for your tantrum, Lady Inquisitor," Daybreaker growled as she leaned down. Quasar froze and folded her ears against her head.\n\n"I will make myself clear," Daybreaker gutturally snapped as her mane whipped a bit faster. "The cult is inefficient. You bicker at the worst of times and heresy HAS slipped through the cracks. I want to ensure that those days are over. Am I clear?" She arched a brow.\n\n"Yes, Empress," Quasar grumped as she looked away.\n\n"Good," Daybreaker replied irately. "Now go! I have much to do, and this did not sweeten my disposition toward you."\n\nObeying, Quasar felt some fear run through her veins for the first time in years."

  solar.132.d:0 ""And I say that we finally DEAL with this apostasy and dispatch every archmage we can spare to finish this!" Quasar Pulse barked at Sunset, who was glowering at the Lady Inquisitor with outrage.\n\nFrom her throne, Daybreaker simply sighed and rubbed at her temples. For the last half-hour, the two unicorns had been arguing over a specific issue in Ordo Silva. The Ordo had recently suffered an increase in heretic attacks—somehow, despite how many had been dealt with—and they had two overarching plans on how to resolve it.\n\nWhile Sunset did see merit in eliminating it, she rightly suggested that since Ordo Silva was more autonomous and allowed slightly more religious freedom, angering the rest of the faithful there with impinging on their "rights" was unwise while the Empire recovered. Unfortunately, Quasar didn't have a shred of empathy for Sunset's plan of Militarium coordination and swift raids on known heretic locations to arrest the culprits.\n\nEither worked perfectly well for Daybreaker, but she normally had more important things to do than handle squabbles between the two sections of the Solaris Cultus. That is, if she weren't overseeing their cooperation.\n\n"Not every problem is solved through brute force!" Sunset exclaimed as she shook her head, which caused the jewelry on her body to jingle around.\n\nWith a snicker, Quasar retorted, "And you believe that simply asking heretics to cooperate will work?" She scoffed and waved a hoof dismissively. "Please!"\n\n"That's not what—"\n\n"Enough!" Daybreaker interjected, the pounding in her head getting worse. As both unicorns jumped in surprise, she cried, "I don't care which one you go with. Compromise! Or, perhaps, use your rank, my foolish student!"\n\nThat got a huff from Sunset.\n\n"Resolve this by tonight, or I will go to the Ordo and solve this myself!" Daybreaker finished with a snarl, and she pushed both out of the room with her magic. As she fell back on her throne, she sighed, "Why did I have to come back to this?""

Its plush exterior still carried the slightest crease from his last rest there, which only made it look more comfortable.\n\nHe tapped his hooves on his desk. Some of the various papers that dotted the wooden surface jittered, with one nearly falling into an inkwell, but he reorganized things soon enough. Keeping appearances prim and proper was necessary when one was the Lord Commander of the Solaris Militarium, after all.\n\nAs he readjusted his black, medaled uniform, he inspected his wrinkled appearance in a small mirror. Despite his age, he still looked rather sharp and just as much the mare's stallion as he had once been. Perhaps he'd put on a few pounds, but that was to be expected at his age.\n\nGlancing back at the couch, he sighed. It would be so much more comfortable if there was a nice mare to relax with. Of course, that was assuming that Auntie Daybreaker wouldn't grab him for some sort of ceremony or another. There was a number of those at the moment, what with her return at all.\n\nA small lump built in his throat. He had had a chance to take the Empire for himself, but he was too paralyzed to take advantage of it. Perhaps he'd still be able to, but it was unlikely. Alas, Lord Commander was going to be his fate.\n\nShuffling a few papers on his desk, he peered out the window to gaze at the pockmarked streets of Sanctum Solar when he heard a soft knock on his office's door. He glanced at it. "Enter," he ordered.\n\nOne of his secretaries, Cherry Blossom, stepped in and then hesitantly smiled at him. Motioning for her to speak, he mused to himself what could possibly be perplexing such a pretty mare.\n\nAfter a couple of seconds of stuttering and shifting on her hooves, Cherry finally stammered out, "L-Lord Commander, there is important news." He arched a brow. Breathing in to steady herself, she stated, "The Empress is preparing to inspect the Militarium. She believes that—" she coughed "—that it isn't running as it should."\n\nAs she said that, Blueblood's heart dropped and he quickly snapped, "No! She's always been satisfied with me! Auntie wouldn't possibly—"\n\nBefore he could finish, the door behind Cherry flung open and knocked her over. The steady beat of metaled hooves echoed on the floor, and a familiar figure caused Blueblood to gulp.\n\n"Hello, nephew," Daybreaker stated with a sneer. "We have much to discuss.""

As the pinky-golden rays of warmth and comfort danced across the floor, they bounced off the mirror of Blueblood, which highlighted the brilliant black and gold cap that usually adorned his head. Normally it'd be another hour or two before it would be taken off its peg and returned to its rightful position. But today was not a normal day.\n\nAs snores echoed through the room, the door to it burst open with a resounding crash, and Blueblood screamed as he sprang from underneath his three layers of sheeting. Bleary-eyed and confused, he struggled desperately for a light as he heard the crisp and clear voice of one of his most trusted generals declare, "Lord Commander! You are late for your new schedule, sir!"\n\n"W-What?" he asked, jogging his memory as best he could. Was he supposed to be somewhere? It was Thursday, and he always slept in on Thursday. Or any other day, for that matter.\n\nA soft sigh came from the mare at the door, and he soon wiped the sleep from his eye to reveal the brilliant white and orange uniform of Iceheart. The brown mare glowered at him with her ice blue and fire orange eyes, and she huffed, "The training regimen. The one by Empress Daybreaker that you agreed to."\n\n"Oh, that."\n\n"Yes, that," she emphasized with a snort and started to trot into his room. He pulled the sheets closer to his body, and she rolled her eyes. Tossing his cap toward him, she stated, "The Inquistionis instructor didn't appear pleased you were late, Lord Commander."\n\nGlancing at his hat, he winced as Iceheart tied up the curtains to reveal the morning sun pouring in. As he covered his eyes, he yawned and whined, "Even thinking about what it could be makes me tired." He cracked his back. "And sore. Ugh, I could go for some pancakes right now."\n\n"I will order some while you're on your way, sir," she replied with a small amount of snark, leaving him to get dressed for the day."

She juked and brought her left hindleg up to connect directly with the groin of her assailant, and she received a satisfying crunch and crack in return.\n\nAn animalistic growl left her throat and she narrowed her eyes at the magical construct that she had empowered. It sunk to the floor, its barely bipedal form shattering from the sheer force she had delivered to its midsection. She was barely sore.\n\nHowever, she didn't have time to waste, as a scorching blast of heat flew just past her nose. Spinning around, she snarled and pawed at the ground a couple of times. As part of her training to recoup the mental and physical atrophy she'd incurred while fending from Celestia, she had given herself progressively more challenging combat situations for which she had to fight her way out.\n\nOver the last few days, she'd probably created more rubble from the broken magical golems than most half of the rebuilding of Sanctum Solar. And she still felt she wasn't ready. Yet.\n\nEvery tactic she could think of, and those that seemed too stupid to be used, she had programmed into those constructs. They would be as unpredictable as possible, and one mistake would spell the end of her at their beam weapons.\n\nAs a couple more swarmed in from the sides of the training room, Daybreaker lowered her stance. Waiting a couple of seconds, she sprang as they got closer, incinerating one with magic, shattering a second with a buck, and then whirling around and crushing the third with another blast of energy.\n\nLanding on the floor, she seethed, her vision going red for a second as she envisioned some of the ponies who caused the mess the Empire was in standing there instead.\n\nWiping her brow, she sighed and froze when she heard a couple of startled gasps.\n\nWhirling around, she saw a pair of inquisitors staring at her from the door, both their mouths agape.

Usually because they involved him finding some excuse to overturn the results.\n\n"I was distracted by a maid;" "There was too much sun in my eyes, so that didn't count;" "Oh, I was asked by Auntie Celestia to write a new poem to commemorate Nightmare Moon's death and I was thinking of the stanzas." Every single one of those early moments still stood fresh in her mind, and she could already tell that he was formulating another reason in that skull of his.\n\nBut then, he smirked himself, and he declared, "Bishop to F3."

The horsehead tumbled and he snatched it in his magic to rest it nicely against her queen that she sacrificed.\n\n"You'll have to do better, Sunset, I've practiced a lot.

She wants me at peak condition for the future." Grabbing her rook, which was now free to move since Blueblood's bishop had left her path open, she stated, "Rook to C1." She thumped it down.

In roughly 15 minutes, at 0815 hours, they arrived at the location of the future incident. According to the priestesses, their initial attempts to spread the word of Daybreaker were conductive. At least three dozen ponies were baptized and saved from their sins, in accordance with usual Adoratio rituals.\n\nAt 1030 hours, a small group of Balish citizens approached the priestesses. When they could not convince the priestesses to leave through veiled threats, they resorted to heckling and jeering. Escalation continued until at 1145 hours, the group, led by one Petri Dish, neared the lead priestess, Apex, and unprovokedly assaulted her.\n\nOther members of the crowd that were dissatisfied joined in attacking the priestesses. At 1200 hours, Militarium garrison detachments arrived to break up the fight, but three, including Petri Dish, had been slain in self-defense. Relations with citizenry have deteriorated since then.\n\n\n\nRecommendation: Pacification of crowds is highest priority in dangerous proselytizing opportunities.

Various projects by their previous owners were underway, and most of those construction sites have at least some chance to be continued.\n\nWithin the last three months, High Mage Sunset Shimmer has traveled to the worst-affected areas, with promises that she would resolve some of the issues. Ponies have been left without home after our military campaigns, which leaves them ripe for disillusion and grassroots insubordinate movements. At the moment, there is relative peace, but ponies will be demanding recompense soon.\n\nHigh Mage Shimmer has suggested that we use the free space to erect new monuments to the Empress or temples for the populace to worship in. Local officials desire to repair the damage that has been done and continue what projects were underway.\n\n\n\nRecommendation: Any solution that reduces homeless population will be a boon for the Empire. High Mage Shimmer's intentions will provide the longest-term benefit, but recruiting the necessary labor may be difficult unless we wish to be subject to sabotage from disgruntled workers. Alternate plans from the local leaders are also acceptable.\n\nSol Invictus,\n\nChief Scribe Dotted Quill"

  solar.142.d:0 "INCIDENT REPORT 7G\n\nDate: [GetDateText]\n\n\n\nSummary: When the Empire annexed its rogue territories, it regained numerous former citizens that had fled to escape so-called persecution by the Solaris Inquisitionis for heresy. Some of these ponies have requested amnesty, as they have seen the error of their ways and that the Empire is simply spread too thin to properly deal with them anyway.\n\nWhile there are some that wish to integrate, others have been leading raids against our garrisons or destroying Imperial property. Organized bands of heretics rove some of the country roads of our new states, which leaves it dangerous for cooperative citizens and soldiers alike. Inquisitors have been dispatched to eliminate them, but even the Speculatores is having trouble finding them while assisting with maintaining order with the Militarium.\n\nRecently, some of the various ex-civil servants of the rogue nations have been of serious concern. Although they have not rallied anypony directly, others are beginning to see them as icons that need to be liberated. Additionally, Solar Strike is under house arrest and it is affecting moral of the Militarium, with knowledge that one of their generals is held captive.\n\n\n\nRecommendation: The layponies must be dealt with first, and they can be dealt with swiftly. If we eliminate those that come to us, that frees up resources in short manner which can be dedicated elsewhere. Executing imprisoned civil servants will reduce the visibility of figureheads that heretics can rally around. Alternatively, some may be released, as they have expressed an interest in cooperating in exchange for their lives.\n\nSol Invictus,\n\nChief Scribe Dotted Quill"

  solar.143.d:0 "INCIDENT REPORT 12U\n\nDate: [GetDateText]\n\n\n\nSummary: During the last three weeks, Solaris Militarium forces have been bogged down with exceptional levels of resistance coming from the former Whinnyapolitan territory of the Marechester Communes. While most garrisons can deal with lingering Harmonist and heretic threats, recent attacks have been more organized and thorough than loose rebel bands would indicate.\n\nSince the conquest of Whinnyapolis, the Marechester Communes, and Solar Strike's ill-fated attempt at governance, the primary legion underneath his command has remained elusive. Many generals believed they would return when they were defeated, since they were part of the Militarium, but they have not initiated communication, and potentially are the instigators of the most recent raids.\n\nRegionally and across the retaken territories, recruitment and military drafting remains at unacceptably low levels. The conquered ponies have occasionally taken to forcefully evicting those they know recruit for the Militarium, or driving presser gangs off their lands. At least three incidents have escalated to armed conflicts, which has left a shaken populace and an edgy military. Dodgers have also been caught working with rebel outfits, although they are infrequent enough that it is not a major concern.\n\n\n\nRecommendation: Solar Strike's legion must be dealt with in due haste. So long as the Empire presents itself as a fractured entity, with elements of its army fighting itself, it will only provoke further rebel cells to form. Best intelligence suggests that the wayward soldiers are near the Crystal Empire's border, potentially in the mountains. More resources can be committed to finding and returning them to serve, but it could be dangerous. Alternate suggestions include promising amnesty or ensuring they will get civilian jobs when found.\n\nDraft dodging will be curtailed through increased Militarium presence when pressing ponies into service. This is more easily accomplished when the above issue is resolved.\n\nSol Invictus,\n\nChief Scribe Dotted Quill"

  solar.197.t:0 "Royal Birthright?"
  solar.197.d:0 "Yawning, Daybreaker reread one of the reports that was resting on the front of her throne. She floated up the paper, basking in the warmth from the twin lavafalls that descended down both sides of the room and lazily flowed through the motes carved into the edges of the floor.\n\nSurprisingly, the entire Empire seemed to be calmer as of late. It niggled at the back of her mind, though, that there was something that was impending. What exactly escaped her though. She shrugged as she let herself muse on it and come up empty. Probably nothing.\n\n"Yo, watch the hooves, bud!" she heard a voice somewhat like her own snap.\n\nSuddenly the doors to the throne room flew open with a blast of magic and one of the two guards normally stationed there careened through the air. Daybreaker jumped in surprise, her magic flaring briefly and incinerating the paper she held in it.\n\nStanding in the middle of the door was a young pegasus with an orange mane, roughly similar to her own. The young mare whipped around and she barked at the guard, who was sliding down one of the windows, "That's what you get! Mess with the Dyx and you get..." She paused and scratched her chin. "The kyx!"\n\n"What is the meaning of this?!" Daybreaker demanded as she descended the dais and marched toward the intruder. She froze when she saw the small horn on the pegasus, or rather, alicorn's head.\n\nLost for words, she cringed back as the alicorn turned to her, a gleaming, toothy smile on her face. "Ey! The bitch has come back! Good to see you, Mama."\n\n"What?" Daybreaker asked, her brain attempting to parse the words.\n\nFeigning hurt, Dyx pouted, "You seriously don't recognize your daughter?!"\n\nAt that, Daybreaker scowled and she snarled, "Whelp! I have no kin, especially not one that I birthed myself!" She scoffed. She would remember if Celestia had a kid. Surely.\n\nSmugly, Dyx flew up and leaned forward as she snickered, "I know where your birthmark is." She whispered quickly into Daybreaker's ear, and Daybreaker slowly, carefully, drew her tail closer to her rump.\n\nGuffawing, Dyx declared, "See?! Knew I'd make the reunion a happy one." She landed with a thump and belched. "Now, where can I crash, huh?" As Daybreaker just remained rigid and stared off into space, she muttered, "Ah, whatever. Mind if I use your room?""
  solar.197.a:0 "What did Celestia have in 673?"
  solar.198.t:0 "The Solar Family"
  solar.198.d:0 "Gritting her teeth, Daybreaker closed the door tightly behind her as she surveyed the room. It had only been hours since Dyx had appeared in the castle. Hours! And already her room appeared like it had been through a bomb blast. Crumbs, scorched furniture, and more! Hours!\n\nWhen Dyx had just waltzed off, Daybreaker had been too stunned to have Dyx captured, and the guards were just as confused as she was. There hadn't been much activity, though, so she almost assumed she had one lasting hallucination from Celestia.\n\nApparently not, though. The torn drapes and the strewn leather jackets were quite real.\n\n"Mooom!" Dyx moaned again, hanging her head over the side of the bed. "Get me a bucking cider! I'm thirst—" She gagged when Daybreaker snatched her by the collar of her jacket and pulled her forward.\n\n"Oh, hey, are we going to start figuring out who we break next, because honestly, I had this idea that we find Nyx and then steal her lunch money—" She coughed again when Daybreaker rattled her with a magical shake. "Or not."\n\n"I do not answer to you, foal!" Daybreaker hissed as she narrowed her eyes and glowered at Dyx. "If you are indeed my daughter, then why search for me now?"\n\n"I dunno," Dyx replied with a shrug and a flip of her mane. Pulling out a packet of cigarettes, she offered one to Daybreaker before she blew a puff in Daybreaker's face. "Kinda got bored sitting around at home."\n\n"I have no children," Daybreaker snarled again.\n\n"Well, I don't know about you, but I remember something about memory magic, a horrible one-night stand, and then—" Daybreaker forced Dyx's mouth shut with magic, although Dyx grinned.\n\n"Enough!" She eyed Dyx once, then sighed tiredly. She should investigate further, but there was a ring of truth to Dyx's words. Plus, the alicorn portion made it a bit obvious.\n\nResigning herself, Daybreaker let go of Dyx and groaned. "Go find something to do. I have to have this mess cleaned." She huffed. "And move you from here."\n\nBefore she could even react, Dyx was off and barreling through the door. "Freedom!" she cried, followed by a bright burst of magic and a couple of screams for mercy."
  solar.198.a:0 "Do I seriously need to be a mother and run a nation?"
  solar.199.t:0 "Digging for Truth"
  solar.199.d:0 ""It cannot be possible," Daybreaker grumbled to herself as she dug through one of her bookshelves in an adjoining room to her sleeping quarters. Although it hadn't been long since Dyx told her the supposed truth, she couldn't quite accept it.\n\nWhile Dyx was on one of her escapades, Daybreaker had taken the time to rummage around in the collection of books that she had. Unknown to most ponies, save the one or two who cleaned the room, she had a small number of journals that she had written while ruling the Empire. Most ponies believed that she was consistently busy, but even an alicorn required entertainment every now and again.\n\nBesides, when there weren't a bunch of heretics to condemn, or a new architectural project to design, running the Empire could be rather dull.\n\nIf her best judgements were correct, Dyx would be in her late teens, which would place everything just after the end of the secession wars. That fact only plagued her further as she tore through another shelf, coming up empty with the contents that she sought.\n\nGrowling, she stood back, sighed, and then went back to work. At last, she let out a cry and pulled out an ornately gilded journal with spiralbound patterns. In fancy script, the words "Musings of an Empress, Part XI" were written.\n\nAs she blew off some dust, she coughed before prying it open. Scanning the pages, she huffed and snorted to herself, muttering a few times "No" or "Not here."\n\nAfter a minute or two, she exclaimed loudly, "What?!" Her face was a bit flush, and she glared down at the words written on the page. It was true.\n\n"...One of the architects has a lovely wit about him," the section began. "It is hard to imagine anypony more handsome than he is. Oh, Sharp Graph, how I long to see you again tomorrow. I believe I have a few things in mind we can discuss..." On the margins of the page were scribbled... hearts and a rough sketch of the stallion in question with even more around him.\n\nDaybreaker blinked. Another page detailed her thoughts a year or so later, after a large "mistake" had been done. Apparently memory spells were a powerful thing when the entire Empire was subjected to one.\n\nAs she slammed the book shut, her mind whirling, she heard an artillery volley followed by a loud whoop that sounded like Dyx.\n\nFacehoofing, Daybreaker screamed, "Guards! Bring that brat to my throne room at once!" She spun around and marched out the door."
  solar.199.a:0 "What in Tartarus has she done?"
  solar.200.t:0 "Like Mother Like Daughter"
  solar.200.d:0 "With an undignified yelp, Dyx was tossed into the throne room of the Imperial Palace and landed near the base of the stairs up to Daybreaker's perch. Shaking herself, she winced when she heard Daybreaker growl, "What do you have to say?"\n\nRemaining calm, Dyx got to her hooves, brushed off her jacket, and pulled down her shades. Had to stay cool, after all. She lit a cig, then finally huffed, "They had it coming."\n\nDaybreaker's face contorted into a sneer, her left eye twitching every so often. Outside the throne room, it still looked like the middle of the day, although it was late at night. One or two screams of ponies as they fled from a roaring inferno that had taken up two blocks of the city filtered through the glass.\n\nSuddenly, there was a thunderous explosion as one of the storehouses for plant fertilizer ignited. Some of the debris smacked against the window.\n\n"Oh?" Daybreaker asked, completely ignoring the destruction that was engulfing the city.\n\n"I mean, yeah, duh," Dyx replied with a shrug. She turned to look at the flames, which reflected off her sunglasses. Smiling, she snorted, "I mean, who else was going to teach those two punks that they couldn't call Dyx, princess of ass-whooping, scared of water!"\n\n"Are you?" Daybreaker retorted.\n\n"Pfft, of course! Flames and water don't mix, you know?! Still, they throw a little water on me, I light them on fire, shoot them out one of those cool cannons, and then burn their houses down. Sounds fair, right?" Dyx innocently fluttered her eyelashes at Daybreaker.\n\nFacehoofing, Daybreaker grimaced and Dyx chuckled. She could tell that her logic was flawless. No way that Daybreaker would have any argument against it.\n\n"Dyx, I believe I have something for you," she Daybreaker finally mumbled as she descended and gently wrapped a wing around her. "You stop being a bitch, and you can be a general." She furrowed her brow in a warning gesture. "Agreed?"\n\n"And shoot whoever I want?!" Dyx cheered. "You bet. Oh! General princess Dyx sounds even better!" She hollered and bolted from the room again before slamming into a wall.\n\nDaybreaker smacked her wing to her face."

  celestia.1.t:0 "Equestrian Remix"
  celestia.1.d:0 "Celestia winced at the gunshots that ricocheted through the streets outside the castle. For the last couple of days, she and a small number of guards who had decided to turn on their former Imperial commanders had held the palace secure. As much as she regretted having to sedate Sunset and the pony with her, she could not trust them, at this moment, anyway, to help her.\n\nShe inhaled. That pony with Sunset. As much as she was an inquisitor, Celestia sensed something different about her. Self-doubt that could be used to show her the way back, perhaps.\n\nNow that the castle was reasonably secure, and there was no sign of organized resistance from Sanctum Solar—Canterlot—yet, she felt that it was time to get the slightest smidgen of normalcy back.\n\nTrotting into the throne room of the palace, she paused and observed the twin lava falls flowing from the ceiling, splitting in two, and then running into motes on either side of the path leading up to her throne. Much had changed, but the little detail of the throne had not. Smirking, she cantered forward.\n\nAs she ascended the dais, she flickered her magic momentarily, and a small hatch underneath the seat opened to reveal an alcove that glittered in the lava's light. Glancing aside at the fires that rose from the city and the soot that filled the sky, she sighed. She had failed when she gave into Daybreaker, and now everypony had paid the price.\n\nReaching into the cubby hole and retrieving her prize, she sadly smiled as she saw the set of regalia she had stored in case of emergencies. At the time she didn't know what, but she thanked herself for being so paranoid of lacking one.\n\nAs she finished, she heard a surprised gasp from the entrance to the throne room, and she spotted a servant bowing anxiously. "Princess Celestia!" she exclaimed. "There is a situation with the Lord Commander! He's managed to flee the palace!"\n\n'Blueblood,' Celestia grumped to herself as she descended. Pursing her lips, she stated, "Very well, but I do not deserve that title." She snorted. "Call me Celestia. Celestia Solaria.""

  celestia.2.t:0 "A Proper Greeting"
  celestia.2.d:0 "Hissing and crackling energy reverberated through the small room that Sunset Shimmer found herself inside. A bright yellow barrier of magic blocked the one door out. While she had tried teleportation initially, Celestia must have used a disruption spell to prevent her from escaping.\n\nThat would have been her first thing to do, too, admittedly, so she didn't fault the Princess. However, the energies that filled the room kept her from sleeping well, along with the nightmares that haunted her from that foray into Daybreaker's mind.\n\nHad she done the right thing? Seeing Princess Celestia again after so many years had locked her up. Before she could act, she was brought back to reality, and Celestia must have finally overpowered Daybreaker.\n\nHer robe lay in a heap near the entrance to the door. That cursed thing she had ripped off almost immediately when she came to in the room. Every time she looked at it, visions filled her head of what she had done, what she had allowed for all those years. How could she have been so stupid?\n\nHolding back a couple of tears, she caught the twist of the entrance's handle and Celestia peered in. The field shrunk by a foot or two so she could enter the room properly, and she solemnly said, "Hello, Sunset." She stared momentarily at her former student. "It has been a long time, hasn't it?"\n\n"Princess," Sunset began as she slipped off her bed and trotted over to the barrier. Celestia bristled at the title and Sunset forced back a couple more tears as she sniffled, "I-I'm sorry! I thought I could keep Daybreaker under control if I stayed, but I just... grew complacent." She fell to her haunches.\n\n"I should have run, I should have tried to fight, but I didn't." She punched the floor. "I was just so stupid! I—"\n\nBefore Celestia could respond, she was tapped by a servant on the back and Celestia whipped her head around. After conferring for a second, Celestia sighed and she declared, "I must go, but I will speak with you again, Sunset." She arched a brow. "There is much we must... discuss.""

  celestia.3.d:0 "Standing outside the door to Blueblood's room, Celestia held back a tired exhale as she twitched her ears at the inane babblings from inside. She glanced over at a pair of guards who were standing outside the room. "How long has been like this?" she asked.\n\n"Shortly after we placed him in house arrest, Princess," the stallion replied, wincing when Celestia glowered at him.\n\n"Celestia Solaria, ma'am."\n\nFrom inside, Celestia heard Blueblood exclaim, "No! The enemy surrounds us, Iceheart! Don't worry! I'll find the Elements of Harmony and stop them!" He giggled a couple of times, and Celestia rolled her eyes.\n\n"That's not the worst, ma'am," the other guard mumbled defeatedly. "Don't ask what he did in Baltimare in 1022." His face turned a pale shade of green and she shivered.\n\n"I will see him," Celestia grunted as she motioned to be let in. Carefully entering the room, she flinched as she saw Blueblood, dressed in nothing but his uniform's cap, charging at his mirror and firing a couple of times at it with his now emptied revolver.\n\n"Die, harmonist scum!" he shouted before his rather flabby form slammed into it and bounced back. As he spun around a couple of times, he perked up when he saw Celestia. "Auntie!" he exclaimed as he rushed toward her. Falling to his hooves, he kissed her shoes and she slowly pulled them back.\n\n"Nephew," she began as she slowly patted his head.\n\n"Are you going to make me commander, Auntie?" he asked, pouting at her. "You promised when I was done my courses in military school."\n\n'Well, he's lost it,' she mused to herself as he then sprang up and paraded around the room like he was leading a small battalion. "You know," she said. "Maybe I should worry about the armies for now. You're still a growing, learning stallion after all." Uneasily smiling, she got up and slipped toward the door.\n\n"Just, keep playing soldier in there, and maybe in time, you can try it out, okay?" she placated as she slipped out. Suddenly she had the urge to shower, and perhaps drown in a couple of bottles of wine."

  celestia.4.d:0 "Unlocking the door to Sunset's makeshift jailcell, Celestia felt her heart warm a bit at her former student. Sunset had specifically asked for her, through their old way of letter communication. While Celestia had wanted to see her anyway, this just sped up the process somewhat.\n\nWhen Sunset noticed her, she galloped toward the barrier and placed both her hooves against them. "Princess!" she exclaimed, and Celestia bit back a small snarl.\n\nSunset had allowed enough pain to happen, but that didn't mean Celestia could reciprocate. Holding her breath for a second, she stated, "Sunset, please. Call me Celestia. I... I don't deserve to be called Princess."\n\nTilting her head in confusion, Sunset mumbled, "O-Okay, Pr—Celestia." She rubbed one of her forelegs uncomfortably, then she exhaled. "Okay, uh—" she bit her lip "—I wanted to talk. About the war."\n\n"Yes?" Celestia drawled, arching a brow and giving Sunset an unimpressed glance. "I take it you're invested in it."\n\nAs a couple of tears slipped down her cheeks, Sunset nodded rapidly and she choked out, "Yes! But, not, not what you think!" She wiped at her nose. "Look, I'm sorry for everything that I let happen! Daybreaker needed help, and she seemed sincerely looking out for ponies. I couldn't sense anything with empathy magic, and I just..." She fell to the floor. "She destroyed the mirror portal after... after she used me to cleanse her cult! Then I thought I could have lessened some ponies' suffering under her, but just, you ignore your conscience enough you, you—"\n\nBreaking out into sobs, Sunset held her face in her hooves and Celestia's chest ached at the sight. Bending down to be eyelevel with Sunset, Celestia stated, "My little ray of sunshine, I understand." She sighed as Sunset peered at her blearily. "What did you want to say?"\n\n"I want to help!" Sunset exclaimed as she sniffled back a couple of tears. "I helped with many of the tactics they use. I can counter them like nopony else!" Puffing out her bottom lip, she stared at Celestia like a wounded puppy. "Please! Let me fix this!""

But that only led to more violence as Solarists took to the streets in Manehattan and Fillydelphia to attack anypony who expressed joy at their freedom.\n\nThe country was in tatters. Farmland was scorched, industry collapsed, and a military in disarray. While help from old Harmonist generals was necessary, many of the militia who fought for them returned to their homes to rebuild and eke out some semblance of living.\n\nAnd Celestia, the ancient alicorn for whom this war had been fought, was alone. Blueblood was getting better from his nervous breakdown, but he would have to be tried for crimes he committed. Sunset was conflicted, and she still hadn't proven she was safe for society.\n\nBut Equestria had survived worse. So long as there is one princess, it would always endure. Always."

  ###Unit Leader Traits###
  fading_experience:0 "Fading Experience"
  fading_experience_desc:0 "Once, Sunset lived in a far away world where bipedal animals were dominant. Now, decades later, the adaptations she had to exercise have slowly faded from her mind. She is still quick of wit but not nearly as flexible as when she was young."
  solar_fury:0 "Solar Fury"
  solar_fury_desc:0 "The burning eye of the sky cleanses all. Her light shines into the darkness. The heretics will know the fury of the Sun."
  pleasant_sun:0 "Pleasant Sun"
  pleasant_sun_desc:0 "While once peace-loving and even-tempered, the decades that Celestia spent trapped in Daybreaker's mind have given her a wealth of knowledge regarding war. While not harsh, she is driven, and expects as much from the soldiers under her command."
  military_genius:0 "Military Genius"
  military_genius_desc:0 "Starlight Glimmer, though never formally trained, adapted quickly to the necessities of war. From her years of leading a cult, she can make ponies do many things they never thought they could. However, at her age, it comes at a cost, and she is unable to sway as many effectively at one time."
  stage_performer:0 "Stage Performer"
  stage_performer_desc:0 "Trixie Lulamoon's background as a traveling performance artist has given her a sharp wit. Although it has been years, the fast reflexes and scrappy attitude it gave her are engrained in her being. Add a natural charisma, and Trixie can lead ponies to the gates of Tartarus without them batting an eye, even if worn to the bone."
  not_stonks_genius:0 "Military "Genius""
  not_stonks_genius_desc:0 "Blueblood was raised in luxury and he lives in luxury. Little was truly learned from the military academy of old Equestria, and he has grown complacent and fat off the work of his soldiers. They do not respect him for his harsh ways, but it does get things done. When they happen."
  protectress_of_the_empress_general:0 "Protectress of the Empress"
  protectress_of_the_empress_general_desc:0 "Although not the first, Archmage Shinespark, like many other archmages, feels a strong devotion to Daybreaker. Her faith and love for the Empress goes far, driving her commanded soldiers to work far beyond their breaking points."
  lord_commander:0 "Lord Commander of the Solaris Militarium"
  lord_commander_desc:0 "The presiding chief of the Solar Empire's Imperial Guard. With the vast resources provided to them, they can improve and streamline supply lines and coordinate planning between disparate segments of the military."
  high_mage:0 "High Mage of the Solaris Adoratio"
  high_mage_desc:0 "The current head of the Solar Cult. Dedicated to ensuring the two branches, the Adoratio and the Inquisitionis cooperate, they also lead the worship and veneration of Daybreaker. With their guidance, soldiers fight with increased zeal."
  solaris_adoratio:0 "Adoratio Priestess"
  solaris_adoratio_desc:0 "The worship branch of the Solar Cult. This leader believes faithful worship will provide victory in the face of the enemy. Time spent worshiping is not time spent preparing for battle, however."
  solaris_inquisitionis:0 "Inquisitor"
  solaris_inquisitionis_desc:0 "The sanctification branch of the Solar Cult. This leader relentlessly searches for heresy and instills in their troops a rabid fanaticism to Daybreaker. However, the occassional executions of discovered heretics in the ranks is not good for morale."
  solaris_militarium:0 "Imperial Guardspony"
  solaris_militarium_desc:0 "A member of the Imperial Guard. This general has been instructed in the art of war through the main academy in Sanctum Solar. Rigorous training provides for effective planning, but the Solaris Militarium is slow-moving, and rarely initiates an effective assault."
  former_cultist:0 "Former Cultist"
  former_cultist_desc:0 "Once an avid follower of Daybreaker and her Solaris Adoratio, this general has renounced the corruption of Harmony and taken up arms in defense of Equestria and Celestia. They still know a few ways to push their troops slightly further, although they are held back by Equestria's ethical requirements."
  former_high_mage:0 "Former High Mage"
  former_high_mage_desc:0 "At one time the leader of Daybreaker's Solaris Adoratio, Sunset Shimmer has renounced the worst of the corrupted alicorn's influence and returned to the light of harmony. Although no longer a follower of aggression, experience provides her ways to push soldiers harder than ever thought possible."
  missionary_of_harmony:0 "Missionary of Harmony"
  missionary_of_harmony_desc:0 "Now that Aurora has seen the error in her ways, she has taken it upon herself to spread the glory of Harmony and Celestia's mercy to the far-flung reaches of Equus. Her past still haunts her decisions, however, and she drives her soldiers beyond what most commanders would deem acceptable."
  evening_star:0 "Evening Star"
  evening_star_desc:0 "Compared to her mentor, Aurora Shinespark, Novus Flux is far kinder and understanding of her troops' needs. Although she does not push her soldiers, and in fact attempts to minimize their losses on the attack, they fight with ferocity to hold their ground, and she takes a personal touch in praying for those wounded."
  twilight_beauty:0 "Twilight Beauty"
  twilight_beauty_desc:0 "With her new freedom under the regime of Celestia, Novus has finally found a cause for which she can fully embrace. While she still is happy to lead soldiers under her command, she ensures that each one is known to her, and she frequently spends time ensuring battle plans have minimal losses, which keeps morale high."
  morning_star:0 "Morning Star"
  morning_star_desc:0 "A shining example of the the ideal Inquisitor, Nova Glow leads her troops with cold-hearted efficiency, bringing them into battle after battle with little in the way of respite. Losses under her command are significantly higher, but she accomplishes the task ruthlessly and quickly."
  crushing_death:0 "Crushing Death"
  crush_death_desc:0 "As a gravitar, Quasar Pulse is an incredibly powerful and incredibly violent pony. Like many of her uniquely touched kind, the gravity manipulation powers have slowly twisted her emotional and mental state, making her prone to lashing out and punishing her subordinates for simple fumbles. Because of this, her soldiers fight fiercely and with loyalty, although the fear she instills pushes many past their limits."
  fire_pony:0 "Embodiment of the Flame"
  fire_pony_desc:0 "Mage Fidelis has been touched by the very Holy Flame itself. A beacon of loyalty, love, and compassion, she follows the Empress without question, her righteous flame cutting through any and all deception and heresy. With her gift, she inspires others around her and pushes them on to fight further for their Empress, for her protection and for the Empire's continuation."
  bleeding_heart_1048:0 "Bleeding Heart"
  bleeding_heart_1048_desc:0 "While a strong and loyal royal guard, Foresight Amour lives up to his last name's Prench meaning. A notorious flirt, he tends to joke at times with his subordinates when he shouldn't, and ensures that they don't take the most dangerous of fights to preserve their losses. Rumor has it he is protected by somepony in high authority."
  loyal_earth:0 "Token Earth Pony"
  loyal_earth_desc:0 "Steel Sickle is the only archmage of the Inquisitionis to be an earth pony. Because of this, she has had a chip on her shoulder for years as she was the butt of jokes for many other of her fellow archmages whenever they convened. Harsh and to the point, she has learned how to dig in well thanks to her earth pony heritage."
  raging_fire:0 "Raging Fire"
  raging_fire_desc:0 "Representing the Holy Flame, General Iceheart's right eye is like a burning pit of fire. Likewise, she is prone to occasional bursts of sudden, and violent, mania in which she conducts her plans. While they are sometimes not as well thought through as her contemporaries, their efficiency and ruthlessness are undisbutable."
  cold_as_ice:0 "Cold as Ice"
  cold_as_ice_desc:0 "Living up to her namesake, General Iceheart's left eye is the opposite of all things warm and loving. Under her command, soldiers are frequently pushed to their limits, with little reprieve except when their goal is finally accomplished."
  princess_regent_general:0 "Princess Regent"
  princess_regent_general_desc:0 "The blessed pony who has been chosen by the God-Empress to rule in her stead while she guards the Empire from the Celestial Throne. Given great insights, wisdom, and charisma, this pony leads the nation and motivates all to fight with renewed vigor and devotion."
  anointed_of_the_empress:0 "Annointed of the Empress"
  anointed_of_the_empress_desc:0 "It has become clear that Princess Regent Shinespark has been blessed by the Empress herself. No pony must question her directives; none should stand against her orders. For her word is that of the God-Empress, and her path is always right. Unto the ends of Equus will her armies fight, and they will be victorious."
  solar_punk:0 "Solar Punk"
  solar_punk_desc:0 "\"Hey, you wanna go burn that bitch Even Grouse's house down? I made a few Molotrot cocktails just for the occasion!\""
  fanatical_fury:0 "Fanatical Fury"
  fanatical_fury_desc:0 "Flame Wrangler is a special case in the Inquisitionis as few stallions are ever allowed to enter let alone reach the position of mage. Because of this, he has espoused extreme loyalty and devotion to Daybreaker, and believes that anything related to her is worthy of adoration, including weather patterns."
  overworked_secretary:0 "Overworked Secretary"
  overworked_secretary_desc:0 "As Sunset's assistant, Stellar Breeze was responsible for far more than a normal pony would have ever been able to take on. Studious to the point of exhaustion, Stellar has helped keep Sunset aloft for years, and leading armies is just one more thing for her. Service with a smile, with a few veiled curses as extra."
  
  ###Operative Bios###
  operative_agentbio_astrum:0 "Dossier"
  operative_agentbio_astrum_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: November 14th, 1015 ALB\n\n§YCover Name§!: Charred Beam\n\n§YBiography§!: There are no secrets in the Solar Empire, except when there are. When that case arises, Astrum Solus is one of the many speculatores tasked by Daybreaker to sniff out corruption, heresy, and keep tabs on the citizenry of the Empire itself, or the various nations surrounding it.\n\nAs a pony who grew up in relative wealth and avoided the immediate effects of the Great War, Astrum traveled through various parts of the Empire – including regions long lost – and gained affinity for remaining hidden when she so wished while traveling. When she showed aptitude for covert abilities and a strong base for magic, she was inducted into training for the Solaris Speculatores, which had recently been created out of S.M.I.L.E. This training covered intelligence basics up to infiltrating entire heretic and rebel organizations and using their own ponies against them. But it was also harsh, especially when certain medical conditions proved to her that she would forever have the life of an agent, doing the will of whichever Arch Infiltrator was in control at the time.\n\nBlessed with an adaptable spirit, Astrum, callsign Gravitas, has worked on lone assignments and with a team of fellow speculatore infiltrators on various missions across the heart of Equus. As part of the Speculatores, she is extremely capable in magic and hoof-to-hoof combat, and knows the various languages that exist in the former Empire. Flirty, playful, and psychotic when the time calls for it, Astrum perfectly exemplifies the spirit of the Speculatores.\n\nIf one notices her before it's too late.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Scroup"

  quasar_pulse_first_greeting:0 "Ah, Princess Regent. Don't mind Snuggles, he doesn't bite. Often. *chuckles*"
  quasar_pulse_first_offer:0 "You come to me for support of Archmage Shinespark? I'm more than willing to vote for her, so long as she can promise additional resources in the fight against heresy."
  quasar_pulse_rejection:0 "Do not look to me when a heretic stabs you in the back."
  quasar_pulse_second_greeting:0 "You've come back, have you?"
  quasar_pulse_second_offer:0 "The offer still stands. You need me to support Archmage Shinespark, I need more funds for purging heresy. It is only for heresy, I assure you."
  quasar_pulse_acceptance:0 "Excellent! I told you she'd agree, Snuggles. Very well, I look forward to what your new High Mage will do. Hopefully she doesn't get... crushed by the responsibility. *snickers*"
  quasar_pulse_acceptance_assurance:0 "Don't worry, Princess Regent. I would never go back on my word. Snuggles makes sure of it."
  blueblood_first_greeting:0 "Sunset. What an absolute PLEASURE to see you. Do you have to bother me so?" 
  blueblood_first_offer:0 "You want me to vote for who? Ugh, fine, I can support this Sparkshine pony or whoever. So long as you let me prototype some of my new military theories."
  blueblood_rejection:0 "You've always had it out for me, Shimmer! See where the Empire stands in a year without MY ideas! It'll be nothing but a pile of rubble!"
  blueblood_second_greeting:0 "What do you want now, Sunset?"
  blueblood_second_offer:0 "Oh, of all the- Fine! I'll vote for your little bitch of a priestess if you leave the Militarium alone. I need the solitude to perfect my genius strategies."
  blueblood_acceptance:0 "I see you've finally fallen for my devilish charms, yes? \"No?!\" What do you mean \"no?\""
  blueblood_acceptance_assurance:0 "Do you not trust me to at least stick to my word, Sunset? Typical." #In case the player goes back after agreeing to support the voter
  seething_corona_first_greeting:0 "Sol Invictus, Princess Regent!"
  seething_corona_first_offer:0 "I've not heard much of Archmage Shinespark, but you wish for me to vote for her? Perhaps, so long as we can come to an... agreement. Considering I'm in charge of Ordo Solis, I'm not given the respect running Sanctum Solar is due. Perhaps you could fix that?"
  seething_corona_rejection:0 "I knew it! I'm surrounded by ingrates!"
  seething_corona_second_greeting:0 "Hello, Princess Regent."
  seething_corona_second_offer:0 "Not gotten enough support, I see. I suppose I have to forgive the slight you put on my honor. So long as Ordo Solis is acknowledged as the prime Ordo, then yes, I'll vote for Archmage Shinespark."
  seething_corona_acceptance:0 "*cackles* Yes! I can finally rub it in Pulsar Beam's face! So long as she doesn't become High Mage, I suppose."
  seething_corona_acceptance_assurance:0 "*giggles* I can't wait to see Pulsar Beam's expression when I come in- Hmm? Yes, I'm still voting for Archmage Shinespark. Not to worry."
  steel_sickle_first_greeting:0 "Greetings, Princess Regent Shimmer. What have you come to ask?"
  steel_sickle_first_offer:0 "Give me more tools for the farmlands. Like it or not, Ponyville and its region still provide most of the food for the Empire, after SOMEPONY drove the neighbors down south away. We can only do so much. Get me more, and I'll vote for Archmage Shinespark."
  steel_sickle_rejection:0 "You'd really let the Empire starve to save on some bits now? I pray that the Empress gives you wisdom."
  steel_sickle_rejection_alternate:0 "You've pledged money to that luddite, Iron Tail but not to me?! Are you mad?! Do you WANT to see the Empire starve?!"
  steel_sickle_second_greeting:0 "Have you reconsidered my offer?"
  steel_sickle_second_offer:0 "*mumbles* I should have been made Regent. *louder* The Empire needs more food. Ordo Messis provides most of it, and we require new and better tools to eke greater yields. Earmark a supply of them, and I'll vote for Archmage Shinespark."
  steel_sickle_second_offer_alternate:0 "*grunts* Empress give me patience. *louder* If you have any sense-although you don't since you supported Iron Tail-you'd provide funding for my farmers to make more food. Please tell me you have a LITTLE in that skull of yours."
  steel_sickle_acceptance:0 "The Empress will be pleased with your wisdom, Princess Regent. Archmage Shinespark has my support."
  steel_sickle_acceptance_alternate:0 "At least you came around in the end. I will vote for Archmage Shinespark."
  steel_sickle_acceptance_assurance:0 "Yes, Archmage Shinespark still has my vote. Please stop pestering me."
  ion_trail_first_greeting:0 "Praise the Empress! How can I assist you, Princess Regent?"
  ion_trail_first_offer:0 "I can vote for Archmage Shinespark, but I have my own troubles to worry about. Ordo Marris is currently experiencing a large uptick in heresy. I could consider Archmage Shinespark's merits if I had additional troops to search the seaboard while I'm here in Sanctum Solar."
  ion_trail_rejection:0 "I suppose you don't need my help after all. Perhaps Pulsar Beam is more amenable."
  ion_trail_second_greeting:0 "Hello again, Princess Regent. Done some thinking, have we?"
  ion_trail_second_offer:0 "Archmage Shinespark has been on my mind as of late. She was the one who found the heresy in the Militarium, no? Surely she would understand if you spared a few troops to aid another struggling Ordo, yes?"
  ion_trail_acceptance:0 "Consider Archmage Shinespark as good as HIGH-ered. Hah! I crack myself up some days."
  ion_trail_acceptance_assurance:0 "Archmage Shinespark is MAGE-orly supported by me, Princess Regent. Oh, Daybreaker, I'm really too good some days."
  iron_tail_first_greeting:0 "Yes? Oh, Princess Regent. What can I do for you?"
  iron_tail_first_offer:0 "The demands of the war forges have not gotten any less intense, but many of my ponies are working with pickaxes nearly rubbed to the nub. If you give me funding for purchasing new equipment, then consider me on board for supporting Archmage Shinespark."
  iron_tail_rejection:0 "When you run out of guns, you'll remember this day!"
  iron_tail_rejection_alternate:0 "You are fine supporting Steel Sickle's little biological tests, but you can't find funding for something practical?! Are you joking?!" #For if you support Steel Sickle before talking to Iron Tail
  iron_tail_second_greeting:0 "Have you come to reject me again?"
  iron_tail_second_offer:0 "Yes, I still need new tools. Pickaxes, industrial sluicers, explosives, you name it. I will vote for Archmage Shinespark, so long as you give me financial support."
  iron_tail_second_offer_alternate:0 "Are you going to be consistent now? Give me funding like you did with that wench, Steel Sickle, and Ordo Meurom will support Archmage Shinespark."
  iron_tail_acceptance:0 "Good! It was a pleasure doing business with you, Princess Regent."
  iron_tail_acceptance_alternate:0 "At least you came around in the end. You hear that, Sickle?! You aren't the only one who gets bits for \"honest\" work!"
  iron_tail_acceptance_assurance:0 "Don't worry, Princess Regent, Archmage Shinespark will be sitting in your former quarters in no time."
  burning_plage_first_greeting:0 "Oh! Princess Regent! What do you want to see me for?"
  burning_plage_first_offer:0 "You'd want me to support Aurora's bid for High Mage? Nopony ever seeks input from Ordo Silva. I... can't just do it for free, unfortunately. There's a lot of undeveloped land in my Ordo, and many ponies are homeless after a skirmish with Bales. Perhaps if some of our industry was diverted to construct new homes, I could pledge my support."
  burning_plage_rejection:0 "I understand. Ordo Silva isn't very important. I guess I'll have to find a way to house these ponies another way."
  burning_plage_second_greeting:0 "Princess Regent! I'm surprised you returned."
  burning_plage_second_offer:0 "*chuckles* Snuggles is a bit of a character, isn't he? *sighs* My offer is still open. But if you still don't want to alter our nation's industrial planning, I understand. But if you want me to vote for Aurora, then I need you to promise that these ponies will be given new homes. Is that possible?"
  burning_plage_acceptance:0 "R-Really?! You'll do it? Oh, okay then. I'll vote for Aurora. Thank you, Princess Regent!"
  burning_plage_acceptance_assurance:0 "Thank you again, Princess Regent. Aurora has my support. I was thinking about it anyway, to be honest."
  sunset_quasar_first_greeting:0 "Hello, Quasar. You've worked with Archmage Shinespark before. Would you support her bid to become High Mage?"
  sunset_quasar_second_greeting:0 "Yes, I've come back."
  sunset_quasar_acceptance:0 "I don't have much choice, do I? You'll get your funding, although I don't know what in Daybreaker's name you do with it."
  sunset_quasar_rejection:0 "No! The Inquisitionis has yielded no further results with all of your allocations! I have to draw the line somewhere."
  sunset_blueblood_first_greeting:0 "Blueblood. I trust you're feeling appropriately gorged today? I won't waste your time. Will you vote for Aurora Shinespark?"
  sunset_blueblood_second_greeting:0 "Obviously to tell you how much of an ass you are. I need your support. Unfortunately."
  sunset_blueblood_acceptance:0 "Why do I have the feeling that the entire city will be in ruins by next Tuesday?"
  sunset_blueblood_rejection:0 "You'll level the entire country in a week. Absolutely not."
  sunset_corona_first_greeting:0 "Sol Invictus, Archmage Corona. Would you be willing to support Archmage Shinespark to become the new High Mage?"
  sunset_corona_second_greeting:0 "Archmage Corona. I still need your support."
  sunset_corona_acceptance:0 "So long as you don't use your new perks as an excuse to use up all the champagne in Sanctum Solar, then fine."
  sunset_corona_rejection:0 "All the Ordos are equal, I don't see what your problem is. Denied."
  sunset_steel_first_greeting:0 "I need your assistance, Archmage Sickle. Archmage Shinespark is better suited than Archmage Beam for High Mage. You must vote for her."
  sunset_steel_second_greeting:0 "I need to hear it again. What did you need?"
  sunset_steel_acceptance:0 "It's a small price to pay for the Empire's survival. Very well."
  sunset_steel_rejection:0 "I've heard of some of your experiments you run in the fields. Cabbage floss? Broccoli balls? You'll use the funding for more of those, not actual farming. No."
  sunset_ion_first_greeting:0 "You can aid me by voting for Archmage Shinespark."
  sunset_ion_second_greeting:0 "Yes, you could say that."
  sunset_ion_acceptance:0 "Why did you not inform us earlier of the growing heresy? Of course I'll allocate some additonal soldiers."
  sunset_ion_rejection:0 "Ordo Marris already has the largest contingent of soldiers out of all the Ordos. You do not need more. What are you doing? Sending them into the Celestial Sea?"
  sunset_iron_first_greeting:0 "I'll be brief. I need your vote for Aurora Shinespark."
  sunset_iron_second_greeting:0 "I've come to consider your offer again, yes. I've yet to make up my mind."
  sunset_iron_acceptance:0 "We always need more weapons for protecting the Empire, especially now without the Empress guiding us. You will get your bits."
  sunset_iron_acceptance_alternate:0 "You're right. I was being hypocritical. The bits are yours."
  sunset_iron_rejection:0 "As much as I'd like to, the Empire isn't made of money. You'll have to make do with what you have."
  sunset_burning_first_greeting:0 "Hello, Plage. I need your help. You could stand between the Empire becoming worse for living in or experiencing a new golden age. Please vote for Archmage Shinespark."
  sunset_burning_second_greeting:0 "It's because you have a pleasant demeanor. I mean that literally. I swear Archmage Pulse's snake is planning how to smother me in my sleep."
  sunset_burning_acceptance:0 "The Empress has unlimited mercy! Of course we'll help get these ponies back on their hooves."
  sunset_burning_rejection:0 "I wish I could, but everything is running at full capacity, and I can't retool entire lines for weeks without disrupting other consumer goods. I'm truly sorry."
  aurora_greeting:0 "*She looks visibly nervous* Hello, Sunset."
  aurora_conversation:0 "Do I need to state the obvious? You put me forward as a candidate instead of Archmage Beam! Of course I'm going to look uneasy, she's one of the favorites of everypony here. You should see how frequently the rest of the archmages gush about her when the Ordos convene."
  aurora_conversation_second:0 "*In a slightly deriding tone* \"Oh, Archmage Beam, how did you dispose of the heresy so quickly?\" \"If we were allowed to marry, I'd want you to have my foals!\" Ugh, that last one makes me want to vomit. How did we get a stallion as an archmage, again?"
  aurora_conversation_third:0 "Right. Hard to believe that Fundamentum was the best option. Anyway, my point stands that everypony here won't be voting for me. I'm honored that you thought me worthy, Sunset, but the Primus has their eyes on another pony."
  aurora_conversation_leave:0 "I pray that you're right. Quasar especially is a viper in a pony's body. Don't trust her."
  aurora_refusal_to_talk:0 "Sorry, Sunset. I'd rather collect my thoughts, right now. Let me know what the Primus decides when they've finished their horn measuring contest."
  aurora_question:0 "Well? What are the results?"
  aurora_pleased:0 "That is... surprising. I thought that the Adoratio Primus would shoo in Archmage Beam. I suppose there's more cunning in you than it appears."
  aurora_displeased:0 "I'm not surprised. Archmage Beam is seen as more orthodox, even compared to me or Archmage Sickle. You did your best, Sunset. Thank you. I'll keep in touch."
  sunset_good_results:0 "It took a lot of begging, bribing, and stealing, but you are now the new High Mage! Sol Invictus, Aurora. I will speak with you tomorrow morning."
  sunset_bad_results:0 "I... wish I could bear good news. Pulsar Beam is the new High Mage. I'm sorry. I did my best, but everypony wanted something in return, and I couldn't cripple the Empire further. Best of luck in Manehattan, my friend."
  sunset_aurora_greeting:0 "You seem troubled. What's wrong?"
  sunset_aurora_second_conversation:0 "Fundamentum Lucis was one of three candidates. Ebriacus Vinum passed out in a pool of her own bile and Lymphatus Cultro threatened the voters with a pair of shivs. Fundamentum just showed up and acted normal."
  sunset_aurora_departure:0 "You'll be surprised, Aurora. Ponies may be willing to change their mind. After all, I have the full weight of the Empress's authority behind me now."
  sunset_pulsar_greeting:0 "Archmage Beam. You seem rather sure of yourself."
  sunset_pulsar_departure:0 "Personally, Pulsar, I wouldn't discount Aurora yet. She has some powerful influence, if you know what I mean."
  sunset_pulsar_departure_alternate_first:0 "No, not a problem at all, Pulsar. After all, you're more than qualified, since you've had no issues at all with Ordo Apparatus." #Alternate line to be a bit more snide with Pulsar
  sunset_pulsar_departure_alternate_second:0 "Except, didn't you have a time when you were flogged by a few heretics? I'm sure those skills at embarrassment will go far as High Mage. *snickers*"
  sunset_pulsar_departure_alternate_third:0 "They did call me the Alpha Bitch when I was younger for a reason. It's nothing personal, Pulsar. Aurora would simply be a better fit."
  pulsar_greeting:0 "A pleasure to see you, Princess Regent. It truly is marvelous seeing the best of the Empress debating away, isn't it? Well, aside from Blueblood. If only that oaf Horizon Sunrise was here instead."
  pulsar_conversation:0 "*laughs* But of course. I have nothing against Archmage Shinespark, but the Empire needs somepony with more years of experience than her to lead the Adoratio and Inquistionis. Everypony here already knows that."
  pulsar_conversation_second:0 "*She gives a slightly mocking pout* It'd be shameful if somepony of Archmage Shinespark's caliber were to be the new High Mage, wouldn't you think? The role needs more stability than what Ordo Multi has experienced these last couple of years."
  pulsar_conversation_third:0 "*She shrugs* Ah well, forgive me for taking up your time, Princess Regent. I look forward to our collaberation once the Adoratio Primus has cast its vote."
  pulsar_leave:0 "*huffs* I wouldn't think you to be so petty, Princess Regent. If you... convince others to elect her, you're making a grave mistake."
  pulsar_leave_alternate_first:0 "I wasn't expecting that, what with your pet that you made trying to save the Empress and all. Do you truly believe that?"
  pulsar_leave_alternate_second:0 "*She frowns and snorts* A joke, of course. Well, Princes Regent, I hope you are more mature outside the voting room."
  pulsar_leave_alternate_third:0 "*Smacks a hoof to her face* Empress, I fear for the Empire's survival."

  dungeon_description:0 "*The walls are crumbling after hundreds of years of disuse and drips of water are audible from many different directions. Nopony has had reason to enter, save for now. Ahead is a single locked cell, and inside is a familiar form, which stirs when approached.*"
  luna_awaken:0 "*snorts and coughs as she gets to a sitting position* Who is there? Stay back! Even in my weakend state, I can still-*Her eyes widen* It's you. Have you come to mock me yet again? I would say \"fair sister,\" but you are not fair nor my sister."
  daybreaker_opening:0 "*cackles* If that is what you wish, little Luna, then I will be happy to oblige."
  luna_annoyed:0 "For what do you wish to see me? Is it not sufficient enough that my sister is gone, the Crystal Empire humiliated, and you reign over it all? Must you still taunt me to this day? *she looks away* I need not more reminders of my failure."
  daybreaker_titillated:0 "I could rub all of those in your muzzle whenever I wish. No, I'm not here to do any of that, I'm just here to watch. To gloat. A bit of big sister teasing. *chortles*"
  luna_resigned_to_mockery:0 "Is this to be the punishment for Us? To verily live the rest of Our-my years in captivity? Please, just end me."
  daybreaker_solution:0 "Oh, that is exactly what I intend to do." #Only choose this if you're boring.
  luna_frightened:0 "What? Thou wouldst not!"
  daybreaker_overjoyed_at_killing:0 "Why wouldst I not? Thou art too much of a threat to Our-Ugh, how do you even speak like that?"
  daybreaker_no_longer_flowery:0 "Like, seriously, it's just so... old! I can't believe you and Celestia spoke that way at one point. Spinstery, if you ask me."
  luna_missed_joke:0 "You art truly a comedian, wench."
  daybreaker_chiding:0 "Now, is that any way to speak to your big sister? I'll just have to make sure your punishment is suitable. How does execution by fire sound? I think it'll make you nice and toasty around this time of year."
  luna_scared_at_end:0 "Truly my sister must be dead! How else could a monster have possessed her so? Very well, I shall meet my fate with the dignity that befits my position. You will not gain any more satisfaction from defeating me, Daybreaker."
  daybreaker_mockingly_sad:0 "Aw, and I was hoping you'd beg. Tsk, I figured as much. You shall join the others in their fate. Goodbye, sister. May we never meet again."
  daybreaker_denying:0 "Now why would I want my dearest, long-lost sister to be killed? Where's the fun in that? We missed so many things that we could have done together, Lulu."
  luna_teased:0 "Do not speaketh to Us in such a way, foul viper! Thou hast not proven thyself to be Our sister in any way! Thou art the scum that We wouldst scrapeth from Our shoe!" #Fun, introspective path
  daybreaker_mockingly_dismayed:0 "Luna! Watch your language! Don't speak to your sister like that!"
  daybreaker_having_fun:0 "Especially after she's helped keep the ponies of Equestria safe. Well... relatively, anyway. *chuckles*"
  luna_done_with_daybreakers_crap:0 "Keep Our ponies \"SAFE?!\" *she kicks at the bars* Art thou mad? *she quiets down* Of course. What were We thinking? That answer is but a short distance from Our muzzle."
  luna_morbidly_curious:0 "*she is silent for a moment* How do you keep them \"safe?\" Dost thou... do you really believe all you've done for them is right?"
  daybreaker_captain_obvious:0 "Of course, sister."
  luna_does_not_want:0 "*scowls* Please, enlighten Us."
  daybreaker_is_best_first:0 "You wish me to monologue? *chuckles* I've not monologued in... oh, at least thirty years!"
  daybreaker_is_best_second:0 "Harmony failed, Lulu. The only way that it survived at all was me injecting Order into it. Celestia saw this as Stalliongrad marched on our lands, and it gave her the strength to carry on, for a time. Until she needed me."
  daybreaker_is_best_third:0 "Its ways are antiquated, naive. This world is too harsh and unforgiving to live without a solid dose of reality."
  luna_unsure:0 "*appears annoyed* And that reality is?"
  daybreaker_captain_obvious_part_deux:0 "The kind, the caring, get trampled over. If anypony is to live, they must have the mettle to willingly give up themselves to a greater purpose. My purpose. A path of Order and peace. I've almost achieved it. It only took longer because ponies resisted."
  luna_noes:0 "Thou art mad! Harmony gives ponies the freedom to live, to be themselves! Thou hast established a regime of oppression and loss!"
  daybreaker_ironic:0 "Oh, I'm mad, for sure. And that anger pushes me to go on. Soon, the changelings and Marelandia will be punished, and the world will be right once more, sister."
  luna_snaps:0 "DO NOT REFER TO US AS BLOOD, DUPLICITOUS SWINE!"
  daybreaker_condescending:0 "I am as much your sister as Celestia was, SISTER."
  luna_confused:0 "*visibly confused* What dost thou mean?"
  daybreaker_monologue_first:0 "Do you not sometimes feel it, Luna? The rage? The anger? The sadness? How they swell up, and then suddenly disappear? Surely, you can feel HER, inside of you, absorbing it. Oh, I know you can."
  daybreaker_monologue_second:0 "Obviously, I speak of Nightmare Moon. She is just as much my sister as she was Celestia's. Different ponies, but the same body. When I say that I'm your sister, Luna. I mean it. In every sense of the word. But I'm not Celestia. I'm far, far greater."
  daybreaker_monologue_third:0 "And prettier. *cackles*"
  luna_what:0 "No, Nightmare Moon was all that I was not. All the rejection I felt, I fed into-"
  daybreaker_pleased:0 "Yes, an alter-ego. What do you think I was for Celestia? She felt guilty, angry, and most importantly, lonely after you were gone. Where do you think that ended up? Me."
  luna_doh:0 "That is obvious. But even when I was lost to my madness, I was still in control. Nightmare Moon never-"
  daybreaker_tired:0 "Oh, Nightmare Moon was only toying with you. From what I learned after the fact, she was one to play games too much. It cost her everything. You hear that, Moony? You were too much of a manipulator!"
  luna_confused_again:0 "Who are you addressing?"
  daybreaker_mocking:0 "Our other dear sister, of course. An alicorn's mind is too strong to have only broken aspects of a psyche. Nightmare Moon is seeing everything, I assure you."
  luna_still_confused:0 "You speak as if it were-"
  daybreaker_goading:0 "Two separate ponies? Yes. Honestly, you should let her out more often. The black fits your dark and dreary attitude so much better."
  daybreaker_revealing:0 "Tell me, do you remember what you did in Celestia's presence after Starlight left? After she first revealed to Celestia that I existed?"
  luna_unsure_again:0 "I... wished her a farewell and a safe trip and then saw her off with you."
  daybreaker_pity:0 "Ugh, you were doing so well. No, you also flipped her the bird and called her a quote \"meddling dalcop\" that nearly \"gobermouched\" her way into casting Equestria into ruin. Oh, you also referred to her as a \"yaldmare.\""
  luna_embarrassed:0 "*blushes violently* I-I... how did you know? You can't have had heard that!"
  daybreaker_pity_some_more:0 "It's a wonder what one can see when they aren't watching what their host observes."
  luna_bemused:0 "I still do not believe you. And if that is the case, then Celestia is in there somewhere and-"
  daybreaker_deadpan:0 "Celestia is dead."
  luna_wha:0 "*stares blankly, then tears start to trickle down* W-What?! She cannot-!"
  daybreaker_done:0 "Search your feelings, sister. You know that it is true. I will leave you to ruminate. After all, we have plenty of time to catch up. *cackles*"

  arrival_part_deux:0 "*Dim light filters through some of the barred windows of the rusted cells. They paint a thin path toward Luna.*"

  daybreaker_gleeful:0 "Hello, sister. I have-"
  luna_you_what_bitch:0 "Do NOT call Us thine sister, dollop!"
  daybreaker_really:0 "Ugh, I really need to get your mouth cleaned sometime, sister."
  daybreaker_ignoring:0 "But I'm in a good mood today. Would you like to know why?"
  luna_bemused_deux:0 "We have a feeling that thou shalt inform us regardless."
  daybreaker_chortle:0 "*chuckles* But of course, for how could I keep this from you. I have enacted the Empire's vengeance of the changeling threat. Their queen is no more."
  luna_doesnt_care:0 "Hmm, how lovely. *she crosses her hooves and glares further*"
  daybreaker_annoyed:0 "You seriously don't want to know how it was done? What I had to sacrifice for ponykind's salvation?"
  luna_irritated:0 "Verily, We couldn't care less what thine armies achieved. It is for naught if the ponies of Equestria live under merely a different iron hoof."
  daybreaker_laughing:0 "Posh, Luna. I don't sap them for love or other emotions. Against their will, anyway. All I ask is for devotion to a cause. Mine. *cackles*"
  luna_scoffing:0 "Ah, so they are merely exchanging one harsh rule for another. We see that our statement is true."
  daybreaker_ticked_off:0 "Everything I do is for the benefit of the ponies under my rule! If it weren't for me, Equestria would be DEAD!"
  luna_deadpan:0 "It is already perished. Thou hast made sure of that."
  daybreaker_disappointed:0 "Luna, Luna, Luna. Always so quick to judgement."
  luna_interrupting:0 "We believe thou art what is called... projecting. *she gives the faintest wry smile*"
  daybreaker_outraged:0 "SILENCE!"
  luna_wut:0 "*She stares in shock*"
  daybreaker_regained_composure:0 "As I was saying. Everything I've done has been for my ponies benefit. They have stability, order, and most of all, harmony."
  luna_sigh:0 "If this is what thou believist to be harmony, then thou hast to look for a new dictionary."
  daybreaker_bruh:0 "Luna, I want to keep everything safe. For everypony."
  daybreaker_sigh:0 "*sighs* You are still my little sister, I only wish you would see the errors you are making."
  luna_are_you_serious:0 "gazes in surprise, although she starts to scowl*"
  luna_WTF:0 "Art thou mad?! Thou admittest to killing Our own SISTER and you believe thou canst simply traipse into Our prison and regard us as FAMILY?!"
  daybreaker_shocked:0 "I-"
  luna_no_way:0 "Thou only share one aspect of Celestia. You share her delusions of unity. We will never see thee as Our sister."
  daybreaker_wait:0 "But I-"
  luna_leave:0 "Leave Us, before We attempt to test the limit of Our confines. Do you wish to drive thy dear \"sister\" to death?"
  daybreaker_oh:0 "I shall go."
  luna_bye_bitch:0 "We wish thine overweight rump would depart faster!"
  end_scene:0 "I suppose I will."
  ###Meeting after Marelandia###
  arrival_the_third:0 "*For once the sunlight has radiated into the catacombs. Long shafts of yellow pierce through some of the shadowy haze and reflect off pools of water. They illuminate Luna.*"
  luna_starving:0 "*Luna doesn't stir. She remains curled on the floor and staring out the cell doors. Her ribs are visible through her fur.*"
  luna_still_angy:0 "After a moment, she coughs and sits up. The familiar scowl from previous interactions is on her muzzle.*"
  ew_rotten:0 "*There is a plate of slightly moldy food sitting beside Luna.*"
  daybreaker_concerned:0 "Surely you must be hungry, Luna? What kind of sister would I be if I didn't-"
  luna_tiredly_pissed:0 "We request, AGAIN, that thou cease referring to Us as thine sister."
  daybreaker_no:0 "Now, Luna, you mustn't be so cranky. It's probably because you haven't eaten well. You could try some of what's next to you. It looks palatable... mostly."
  luna_bruh:0 "What dost thou intend to speak to Us regarding this time? *she lays back down and gazes off into the distance* We can see thou art excited about something."
  luna_bitchy:0 "*a wry smile forms on her muzzle* Mayhap thou hast finally had a good night's rest? Or dost thou instead merely prey on thy ponies' blood for energy?"
  daybreaker_enough:0 "*sigh* For once, could you speak, NORMALLY?!"
  luna_surprised:0 "*she blinks a couple of times* Fine, Daybreaker. It was getting boring anyway. You could have at least played along for a short while. *she huffs and rolls her eyes*"
  daybreaker_annoyed_again:0 "You'd almost think that you were trapped in time for a millennium."
  luna_quiet:0 "*Luna says nothing*"
  daybreaker_conversational:0 "I suppose I could share what's gotten me so excited... Luna. Marelandia is finally gone! Squished, like the vermin they were! *cackle*"
  daybreaker_excited:0 "The Inquisitionis has its work cut out for it! Oh, I can hear the screams of MARESOC now as they're set upon a pyre! With a little poof, they'll be out of our mane forever!"
  luna_unenthused:0 "It seems then you've gotten everything you've wanted, didn't you?"
  daybreaker_orly:0 "Not just me, sister! Don't be so pouty, you know Mother always hated your moodiness!"
  luna_eyeroll:0 "*Luna rolls her eyes again*"
  daybreaker_mothering:0 "You'll make your eyes fall right out if you do that! Jeez, I'm sounding like Mother now."
  luna_get_to_the_point:0 "What do you want?!"
  daybreaker_tsk:0 "Our ponies are safe again! No more communists, no more damned changelings. Well, aside from the ones forced to repair all the damage they did in the war."
  daybreaker_ranting:0 "In only a few years, I've regained all the land that was lost do those cursed insects! They've been brought to their knees! Everypony FEARS the name of Daybreaker Sun, for I am the light that exacts vengeance for my ponies' suffering!"
  daybreaker_going_ham:0 "The Marelandians are DEAD. Mareland is now part of the Empire! Peace has been restored. Prosperity is on the horizon! Justice has been SERVED! *cackle*"
  daybreaker_oblivious:0 "Do you not see, Luna?! I have done all this to save my, OUR ponies! The wars are over, the day has been won. I'VE brought order to the Equus, to the world!"
  daybreaker_still_talking:0 "Celestia was weak! I have perfected her! She may be gone, but I've risen like a phoenix from her ashes. The griffons and their backward continent know that Daybreaker Sun will protect her ponies! Nothing will harm any of us ever again!"
  daybreaker_realized:0 "This is a new - Luna?"
  luna_bored_more:0 "*Luna is still staring into the distance. She barely registers anything.*"
  luna_distracted:0 "Hmm? Were you telling me something of interest?"
  daybreaker_worried:0 "Were you not listening to me at all? You never listened to me! Not once since-No, the time for anger is over."
  daybreaker_trying_to_be_kind:0 "I was explaining - and if you didn't have your ears full of wax, you could hear - how the Empire has been established for eternity. Nopony could ever hope to threaten-"
  luna_ok_bitch:0 "That is nice, Daybreaker. I wish you luck in ruling your new Empire. *she yawns and lies down*"
  daybreaker_what:0 "...Are you not going to eat your food, at least?"
  luna_ho_hum:0 "I am not hungry, sister."
  daybreaker_more_concerned:0 "Do not lie to me, Luna! I am your-"
  luna_shut_up:0 "Yes. My sister. *she waves a hoof dismissively* Perhaps tomorrow. I am tired. I am cold. I wish to sleep."
  daybreaker_you_sure:0 "Luna, I am asking you to keep-"
  luna_seriously_shut:0 "I do not wish to speak longer, sister. I'm sure I must be stalling you from administering your new territories. *there is a tiny bit of sarcasm to her voice*"
  daybreaker_uh:0 "Luna, don't make me-"
  luna_goodbye:0 "Farewell, Daybreaker. I wish you the best in protecting everypony. From you as much as outside threats."
  daybreaker_missing_the_point:0 "Luna..."
  luna_sleeping:0 "*She doesn't respond. Only a couple of loud snores escaping her lips.*"
  daybreaker_depart_forever:0 "Oh..."
  fin:0 "*Leave quietly and shut the door without making a sound.*"

The Empress has mandated that this ship be launched, and currently the date is §Rfixed.§! However, constant naval technology improvements, as well as a looming modernization of the Imperial Navy could prove the excuse to continue stalling when it has its first sail until we are well and truly ready.\n\nAll of the Empire now waits for this pinnacle of Imperial achievement, so delaying will not only upset the Empress, but could be a sign to our population that we are §Rnot confident§! in our might.

  ordo_description_1:0 "The most populous of the Ordos, Ordo Multi is the primary manufacturer of weapons for the Solaris Militarium. Manehattan and its surrounding burrows' citizenry toil in the war forges of the Empire in preparation of eventual war. As of late, the Empress-allowed unions have grown restless, and it has taken additional focus away from maintaining order throughout the rest of the region."
  ordo_description_2:0 "Ordo Silva is one of the two sparsely inhabited Ordos of the Empire, and is mostly concerned with basic artisan goods. Comprised of conservative ponies, the Inquisitionis has had to adapt to keep stability, allowing a slightly laxer standard of heresy. Its archmage has been described as a \"nice\" pony."
  ordo_description_3:0 "A majority of the farmland of the southern Empire resides within Ordo Mellis. The chapter house for the Inquisitionis is stationed in Ponyville, to provide as much oversight to the town of heresy as possible. Archmage Steel Sickle keeps them in line with a hoof almost as solid as the Empress's."
  ordo_description_4:0 "Ordo Maris is on the rich coastline in the nook of the Celestial Sea, where many fish and different plants grow for additional nourishment for the Empire. While the laypony has not caused much issue in the Ordo, Archmage Ion Trail has been reprimanded a few times for her practical jokes she tends to pull on others."
  ordo_description_5:0 "The other industrial center of the Empire, Ordo Apparatus is focused on secondary materials for Ordo Multi and for meeting the ascetic needs of the general population. A haze hangs over the region from the many blast furnaces and other metallurgy buildings in the capital of Fillydelphia, giving a Tartarus on Equus appearance."
  ordo_description_6:0 "Smog fills much of the interior of Ordo Meurom, the region of the Empire dedicated to delving deep into the earth for resources to feed the ravenous factories of the Solar Empire. Most ponies have been hardened by the endless toiling of mining and refining of raw materials to send to the cities, a sentiment shared by the Ordo's archmage, Iron Tail."
  ordo_description_7:0 "Comprising the very heart of the Solar Empire, Ordo Solis is strictly Sanctum Solar and the region immediately around it. The High Mage of the Solaris Adoratio and Inquisitionis resides here, and churches tend to the needy pilgrims that visit the holiest place in the Empire. Within the center of the city, near the Imperial Palace, Daybreaker's Collegiate for Blessed Unicorns instructs the most talented ponies across the Empire to serve and ward off heresy."
  ordo_description_8:0 "Created after Solar Strike's rogue invasion of Marechester, Ordo Lapidis has remained isolated from the Solar Empire at large. It pays lip service, but it has never stayed very much in line with the orthodox of the wider Empire. It will take a strong hoof to get it under control and loyal to the Empress."
  ordo_description_9:0 "An area of learning and knowledge, Ordo Doctrina is filled with the academics of Bales, many of whom still hold a grudge against the Empire. Scribes and inquisitors pour over the vast pools of information that have been stored in the libraries of the former technocracy, and ponies have been rounded up routinely for heresy. There is still unrest, but they can do little with their toys removed for their \"safety.\""
  ordo_description_10:0 "Stretching over much of the western heartlands of Equestria, Ordo Caellum is the new powerhouse of the Solar Empire. As there are many flat valleys and little forest north of the Twilight Range, thousands of wind farms have been erected to harness the power of the storms that Cloudsdale now exclusively produces, which cover the entire land in a dark and foreboding atmosphere."
  ordo_description_11:0 "Ordo Munificus was constructed out of the remains of the Principality of Central Equestria, taking over much of its duty as the primary food producer for the Solar Empire. Resistance has been high as the earth pony farmers have proved extremely stubborn in accepting Imperial rule, leading to stern and harsh punishments from Archmage Bitter Harvest, up to and including burning entire fields of crops."
  ordo_description_12:0 "In honor of the swift victories that first greeted the Solar Empire in the War of the Southeast, Ordo Velocitas was ordained for the northern half of the peninsula to control the reconstruction of Balitmare and its surrounding regions. Unrest has been extremely light, with the threat of death for the slightest failures keeping the local citizens in line."
  ordo_description_13:0 "Ordo Diligentia is centered around the second Southeastern megapolis of Stableside, which was only lightly damaged in its recapture. An area filled with unrest, smog, and decaying vegetation, Ordo Diligentia is an example of how to swiftly rebuild after destruction, an effort that its archmage has taken pride in."
  ordo_description_14:0 "In the confusion of taking Stalliongrad's puppet, Ordo Confundas has been established to provide some semblance of stability in the chaotic lands bordering the de jure territories of the two nations. Despite the attempts of its archmage, the region is still rife with incompetent oafs who lead to disaster after every turn, reducing the ability to reconstruct the area."
  ordo_description_15:0 "Stretching from the southwest of the Severyana region to the Griffish Isles, Ordo Servus is a mix of various industrial and agrictultural hubs that fed the former lands of Stalliongrad. Centered around Altigrad, the ordo is dedicated to producing various consumer goods and foods for the rest of the Empire through utilizing the old tools of the communist nation."
  ordo_description_16:0 "Ordo Ferox is situated around the general region of Stalliongrad, the former communist capital used for its various military factories to churn out endless weapons of war. Despite constant oppression by the Inquisitionis, there are many cells of rebels who wish to see Stalliongrad return, with frequent protests a common sight in the ordo."
  ordo_description_17:0 "Situated on the border between desert and lush grassland, Ordo Praeda is sparesly populated and has little mineral wealth for the Empire. Most of the ponies are rugged and have already led multiple attempted uprisings against the Solaris Inquisitionis, requiring a larger presence of soldiers to keep the area pacified."
  ordo_description_18:0 "Aptly named, Ordo Infernum comprises the hottest but most resource-rich areas of the southwest of the Equus continent. While overburdened by the changeling-backed oligarchy, the land has only further declined under Solar control. The desert spreads and the heat swells further, leaving everypony there hot and miserable as they toil on the oil fields."
  ordo_description_19:0 "Ordo Mercatura has already become a center of trade within the Empire. With the many ports and railroad connections in Las Pegasus, freight and logistics travel through the hub and enriches the businessponies allowed to operate. Currently, a mission from the Adoratio has been established to "cleanse the populace of their debauchery," which has led to more than a few public burnings of the worst sinners."
  ordo_description_20:0 "As one of the border Ordos with Changelingia, Ordo Litus is the primary stop point for soldiers on their way to the front line. Many changelings live in the region, as Chrysalis attempted to permanently expand her population's core territory, and have been placed firmly as second-class. Numerous dockyards dot the cities, where they are put to work forging new warships for Changelingia's destruction."
  ordo_description_21:0 "Most ponies of the Solar Empire do not remember the lands that comprise Ordo Salus. As some of the first territory gained by the changelings, much of the landscape and culture has been altered. Changeling is an official language spoken by many, including the pony populace of the region. This barrier has made establishing control over the populace much more difficult, while slowing monuments to the Empire's victory."
  ordo_description_22:0 "Less an Ordo and more a puppet nation, Ordo Tenuis is established on the de facto borders of the Crystal Empire. In a short time, the Crystal City has been rebuilt into a heavy industrial hub, with multiple kinds of magical clouds are discharged into the sky, polluting the nearby lands with residual energies from the crystal refining process. Mines have cut through much of the northern mountain range, which in turn extract those crystals for the Empire's further use."
  ordo_description_23:0 "[ROOT.GetNameDefCap]'s most distantly administered realm, Ordo Serenus is comprised of the old maritime territories of Puerto Caballo and the Summer Islands. Despite their freedom from the South-east, they have barely changed their ways, as they desire to keep their friendly and worker-glorifying traditions alive. Multiple festivals celebrate the local industries, such as fishing and iron mining, to bring workers together as companions. Recent Imperial activity has attempted to stop this, but it has met stiff resistance."

  solarordo.1.d:0 "With a slightly shaky hoof, Quasar Pulse, Lady Inquisitor of the Solar Empire, knocked on the massive wooden doors in front of her. On either side of the frame, a soldier dressed in brilliant golden armor stood at attention. Everything was quiet. Too quiet.\n\nSquinting at one of the guards for a second, she could see him begin to sweat as her eyes traced over his form. \"I could crush him in a second as an example to the other!\" she thought to herself, if only for a moment. It was tantalizing, the raw power she could hold over them, but it was not why she was here.\n\nAfter a couple seconds, there was the sound of hooves wearing metal shoes clanking on a stone floor. A lock was fiddled with, and then a latch released, presenting Quasar with a small sliver of a view to the inside room. In front of her, the whelp that High Mage Shimmer used as a glorified secretary. What was her name? Smellar Sneeze?\n\n\"I am here to see High Mage Shimmer,\" she said, letting a bit of pomp slip into her voice.\n\nThe yellow pony on the other side of the door stared at her for a second. In a deadpan tone, she stated, \"High Mage Shimmer is incredibly busy taking care of your previous mess, Lady Inquisitor-\"\n\n\"Do not be coy with me, insolent rat!\" Quasar spat as she powered her horn, ripping at the door with her magic and cracking the wood into slivers.\n\nSunset's servant winced and staggered back, allowing Quasar to barge through the cloud of razor-sharp wood, her cloak billowing behind her. When she entered, Sunset Shimmer looked up from her dark oak desk. On either side of her were some bookcases, and on her left, the sun brightly illuminated her greying fur and mane.\n\n\"Quasar,\" Sunset muttered, dropping the quill she was using and rubbing a temple. \"What is it now?\"\n\nSmugly pushing aside Sunset's maid, Quasar approached the desk and slammed both her forehooves on it. \"The Inquisitionis requires more funds! Heresy is rife in the palace. I can smell it!\" For emphasis, she sniffed hard before she sneered at Sunset.\n\nEars falling flat, Sunset sighed and massaged her forehead further. \"Quasar, everypony here is constantly under surveillance. How could anypony even possibly be a heretic?\"\n\n\"Heresy knows no limits, High Mage,\" Quasar responded, giving only a single snort before sneering. \"Everypony is guilty until proven innocent.\"\n\nMomentarily staring at Quasar, Sunset finally groaned and mumbled under her breath, \"You're not going to let this go?\" She shook her head and waved a hoof. \"Fine, you have my blessing. Sniff out this heresy, Lady Inquisitor.\"\n\n\"Sol Invicta!\" Quasar exclaimed, her heart fluttering with the glee of a five-year-old filly. Soon she would see the enemies of the Empress crushed, driven before her, and hear the lamentations of their fillies.\n\n\"Sol Invicta,\" Sunset replied, beating her chest with a hoof and then motioning for her to leave. \"Repair the door if you can on the way out.\""
  solarordo.2.d:0 "Pressing down her cloak for a moment, Quasar Pulse sneered as she shot her gaze between the two guards on either side of the doorframe. It was time.\n\nWithout bothering to announce herself, she pushed the doors open with her magic and felt a heavy thud as something smacked into the opposite side. As she stepped through, she looked down and saw that she had whacked Sunset's yellow-furred slave, Cellar Cheese.\n\nAlthough it had been a few months since Sunset had approved of her grand crusade against heresy, Quasar believed it had been most productive. Dozens of ponies, all extensively studied, occasionally questioned, and maybe interrogated at gunpoint a few times were in files held in her saddlebags. Now it was only a matter of presenting them to Sunset.\n\nOnce again, Sunset was busy working on something with a quill, and she groaned as she put the instrument away and looked up. Dark circles and visible wrinkles underlined her eyes, which were made only more tired-looking from the muted, overcast sky. Without saying a word, Sunset motioned with a hoof for Quasar to speak.\n\nGrinning, Quasar dropped the piles of dossiers on Sunset's desk and stood back. An eager nicker worked its way through her throat, and she could barely keep from standing still. The anticipation was killing her.\n\nFor a short while, Sunset silently worked her way through the files. She eventually stopped, and looked up, \"'The maid who occasionally cleans Blueblood's room?'\"\n\n\"She always does a horrible job, High Mage.\"\n\nNodding unenthusiastically, Sunset went through another. Arching a brow, she asked, \"'Cinnamon, the dish washer on the third-floor kitchen?'\n" She snorted. \"Did he put too much spice in your hayburgers one day?\"\n\n\"I eat nothing but grass and carrots, High Mage,\" Quasar retorted, keeping her face straight and staring at her superior with a touch of disgust. \"Snuggles can have whatever he wants, though,\" she added in reference to her pet.\n\n\"Of course," Sunset snarked, tossing the file into a pile with the first one. After digging through more of them, she hummed to herself. \"'Hot Air was spotted speaking with later-captured heretics... Golden Spoon was heard expressing their distaste that the Empress had yet to fulfill her promise of funding her monument project... Hedge Fund was caught reading a book on sun jokes...'\"\n\n\"There is more,\" Quasar stated, tapping additional files, \"but I have provided enough evidence. This has been a formality.\" She stood up, grabbing the dossiers in her magic. \"I trust you're not getting second thoughts.\"\n\n\"Never!\" Sunset declared with a wave of her hoof. Glancing to the side, she stated, \"Go, you can have your little crusade. Sol Invicta!\"\n\nNarrowing her eyes, Quasar stared at Sunset for a second before whirling around and storming out of the room. As she slammed the door, she heard another thud as she caught Sunset's bondmare on the chin."
  solarordo.3.d:0 ""I do not see why I must be your guinea pig," Sunset's servant, Teller Teas, protested as Quasar Pulse and a couple of other inquisitors stood in one of the spacious halls of the Imperial Palace.\n\nSome ponies were currently bustling around them, giving a small berth to Quasar especially as she gently rubbed the head of Snuggles. The boa constrictor hissed contentedly and coiled slightly tighter around her torso in a scaly hug.\n\nWith a snort, Quasar flicked her head in the direction of the hallway. Currently engrossed in a surely stimulating conversation with another bureaucrat, Inkstain shifted his eyes over his shoulder. However, Quasar and her squad were hidden in the bustle of the morning hoof traffic, and he went back to his discussion.\n\n"It is simple," Quasar stated with a hint of exasperation. "You are our distraction. He was to meet with High Mage Shimmer today, you are merely there to take him to her. We will position ourselves to prevent an escape."\n\nThe yellow unicorn was clearly unconvinced. Sighing, she hung her head and nodded, wordlessly trudging toward Inkstain. After a moment, she reached him and began to direct him toward Quasar. With a sneer, Quasar stood and gave a soft shrug. Snuggles slithered his way off and behind a nearby pillar.\n\nMoments later, Feller Fleece brought him into view of Quasar, and he instantly froze. "Good," Quasar mused to herself, and stomped toward him.\n\n"L-Lady Inquisitor," Inkstain mumbled as he gave her a small bow and nervously peered at her. "What can I do for you?" When Quasar remained quiet, he tittered and took a couple of steps back, "I-I'm afraid that I'm quite busy, I c-can make time for you-"\n\n"That won't be necessary," she replied, drawing her muzzle back into a vicious grin. "This will be the last appointment on your itinerary." She walked closer. Flicking her tail, she began, "Tell me, does last Wednesday at the twenty-second hour ring a bell to you?"\n\nLaughing, Inkstain declared, "I'm afraid you're going to have to be more specific than that-" He paused when he felt something slither up his leg. Looking down, he screamed as Snuggles wound his way around Inkstain's legs and pull tight. Within seconds, Inkstain was in a bundle of scales, only his head remaining unburied.\n\nSquirming, he yelped as there was a soft crack from his torso and his breathing grew ragged. With effort, he demanded, "W-What is the meaning of this?!" Another shriek escaped him as Snuggles wound tighter.\n\nCoyly, she glanced at him and clicked her tongue. She slapped him lightly on the cheek. "You do not question an inquisitor, heretic!"\n\n"H-Heretic?! I-" He coughed and groaned as the coils tightened further.\n\n"Silence!" Quasar lit her horn and yanked him forward, part of his muzzle contorting with the strength of her grasp. "You will tell all before this is over. Everything about your operations, and your little, heretical friends!"\n\nCackles echoed through the halls, almost drowning out the crunch of bone and screams for mercy."
  solarordo.4.d:0 "New data suggests that the investments of funds into Ordo Multi have paid off. Recent figures from the primary forges in the Bronks and Manehattan Island indicate that hundreds of more firearms and tanks are produced every day in the city. Due to the attention from Sanctum Solar, morale has soared to a new high in the region and the archmage reports that heresy has dropped considerably as more ponies find work in the cities."
  solarordo.5.d:0 "Recent news from Ordo Silva indicates our propaganda campaigns have borne fruit. With new factories churning out weapons, a number of ponies have volunteered for sevice in the Solaris Militarium. Orthodox thinking has also increased, with far less deviancy threatening the stability of the Adoratio's doctrine."
  solarordo.6.d:0 "With the increased storage of food in Ordo Mellis, recent demographcis have indicated a small population boom in the general area. Many new families have moved to Sanctum Solar for potential work and the superior education of its church schools and to ensure that their foals will be cleansed of their sins."
  solarordo.7.d:0 "After finding appropriate ships to requisition, Ordo Maris has done as instructed and refit the best civilian vessels to become new warships. They are not purpose-built, but they will be effective patrol vessels to guard our waters from potential threats and alert the Imperial Armada."
  solarordo.8.d:0 "Compared to Ordo Solis and Multi, Ordo Apparatus was falling behind on industrialization and production quotas. Our stimulus has been put to good use, and numerous factories and refineries have been built to fuel a rapid spike in output for both the civilian and military sectors."
  solarordo.9.d:0 "The central lands of the Solar Empire have many untapped pockets of natural resources that have yet to be mapped. With our funding, Ordo Meurom has finished a month-long process of surveying the region and establishing new mining operations where significant deposits were discovered. Already, shipments have been flowing between the Ordos to furnish further expansion of military industries."
  solarordo.10.d:0 "After months of propaganda and training, new regiments are ready for orders from Ordo Lapidis. Additionally, ponies have expressed more desire to serve in the Militarium and to protect the fringes of the Empire from any possible Harmonist threat in response to these new information campaigns."
  solarordo.11.d:0 "Much of the knowledge that [BLS.GetNameDef] had hoarded for themselves after ceding from the Empire has been recovered. Dozens of scribes spent hundreds if not thousands of combined hours to unlock any secrets that Bunsen Beaker and the other members of the Directorate might possibly have uncovered. Although much of it is clearly heresy and must be destroyed - along with those who read it - there are some interesting avenues of research regarding ponykind's inherent magic. It would be trivial to continue the experiments, if funding was provided and the Empress's eye was turned the other way."
  solarordo.12.d:0 "As Ordo Caellum is an amalgamation of different regions of the western heartlands' culture, it is surprising that so much ahs been done in such short order. Reports indicate that mining has boomed, which has fed back into the industries in Cloudsdale. Along with this, the weather factories report increased yield, allowing our new weather farms to power more of the Empire for less. In all, the Ordo has placed itseful as a useful asset with remarkable speed."
  solarordo.13.d:0 "With the last of the purges of the old nobility finished, Ordo Munificus reports that many of its conscripts have been freed from maintaining order and are free for stationing elsewhere within the Empire. On top of this, many farmers have been replaced by industrial machines, meaning there are many more bodies that can be put on the front line. Even if they have qualms, supplying for their families will drive them to serve, if nothing else."
  solarordo.14.d:0 "The latest dispatches from Ordo Velocitas relay that the final steps in creating a new civilian fleet have been finalized. Now that their new drydocks are free, they can be tasked with constructing for the Empire. Recently, new crystal veins have also been found on the Dragon Isles, and mining operations have begun. We shall soon see the benefits of the exploitation."
  solarordo.15.d:0 "Despite being the other major industrial center of the former South-eastern Governorate, Stableside has seen its fair share of decay. With our recent investments, many of the slums and ghettos that were erected in former industrial districts have been cleared, and new factories have been constructed in their place to feed the Empire's war machine. They will have to find another place to squat, or they can work in the sweatshops themselves for a chance fo survival."
  solarordo.16.d:0 "To say that [AWR.GetNameDef]'s economy was a mess would be the understatement of the past millennium. While it was expected there would be resistance to being pressed into service, instead the Militarium was met with open arms, as many ponies were promised food and a place to sleep. New regiments await our generals' orders as we speak."
  solarordo.17.d:0 "Before Stalliongrad revolted from Equestria, St. Petershoof was an industrial powerhouse of the north-east. However, Sinister Serov had let the city degrade as he focused further on his pet project norht of Stalliongrad proper. With the repair and repurposing of the steel mills in Altigrad, the old city can be useful once more, and it can also exhaust more communists to prevent them from growing insubordinate against our rule."
  solarordo.18.d:0 "As there is plenty of aluminium in the regions around Stalliongrad, we have diverted more production to the fighter factories in the city. Although never known for superior craftsponyship, the results from the arms factories will be welcome as we continue to rebuild the airforce in preparation for future wars."
  solarordo.19.d:0 "As it is sparesly populated, Ordo Praeda has little left for us to exploit or add to. Appleloosa is one of the only major cities of the region, and we have provided some funds to expanding its industrial base. Additionally, small deposits of oil have been prospected in the desert, which will help build our future reserves."
  solarordo.20.d:0 "It's the motherload! Beneath the scorching heat of the sun in the San Palomino desert, our surveyors have found gushers of oil! New pumpjacks are already being erected, but it's still going to take time for full production to begin. As the Militarium relies on more and more fuel-hungry tools, this has not come at a better time. Praise the Empress!"
  solarordo.21.d:0 "For once, there is little to report from an Ordo. Abhorrently Rich is the only archmage that has paid their way into service, and she has provided more benefit in a few short months than most Ordos have in their lifetime. According to her, she's recruited a couple of experts in manufacturing and finance for us to utilize at our pleasure. We shall see how helpful they truly are."
  solarordo.22.d:0 "In the buil-up to the Great War, a new Lunar Ocean fleet was commissioned and began construction in Vanhoover. During this entire time, the hulls have been laid in drydock, rusting and seeing disuse. Now that we control the city again, we used restoration spells to repair the hulks and get them into military service. They may be old, but they will bring added firepower to our navy whe it is needed most."
  solarordo.23.d:0 "Construction has finally ceased in [1216.GetName], and we can admire our slaves' labor. A massive monument now rests in front of Chrysalis' old quarters in the city, proclaiming Daybreaker's salvation to everypony. We have done it. We have freed the Empire! Sol Invictus!"
  solarordo.24.d:0 "Reports from Ordo Tenuis indicate that our mining surveyors have not come back empty-hooved. Many veins of minerals and crystals, all useful in magical application, have been discovered in the northern mountains. Mines will be set up shortly, and soon they will be extracted for the Empire's use in both weapons and defense matrices."
  solarordo.26.d:0 "Initiating this project is §Rpermanent§!. We do not control the rest of the Ordo at this time. Do you wish to proceed?"
  solarordo.27.d:0 "After pushing through longer working hours, the ponies of the manufactories have finished their quotas, and have gotten us more weapons to serve the Empire. Their sacrifice will not be in vain!"
  solarordo.30.d:0 "Much of Puerto Caballo and the Summer Islands has been restructed for military purposes. Reports have indicated that numerous dockyards have successfully finished and come online, which has attracted more ponies to the island chains. Despite these new jobs, the locals have remained resistant, as they do not wish to see their peaceful ways disrupted, and have protested this militarization."
