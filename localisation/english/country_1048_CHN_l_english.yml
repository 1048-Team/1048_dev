  CHN_idea_memory_44:0 "Memories of 1044"
  CHN_idea_memory_44_desc:0 "1044 was, without a doubt, a disaster for the Changelingian ability to control the conquered territories, establish an effective militia unit, and properly answer an uprising that accumulated into our greatest enemy since unified Equestria, Grand Equestrian Partisan Force. For three years we have grained against a pitiful rebellion that organised into a fighting force that managed to challenge us. It was only thanks to the direct military intervention of our professional forces and the love fueling of our units that we managed to get rid of those rebellious pests.\n\nBut even with this victory, our grand army is nothing more than a disorganised and scarred formation that can be barely called an army. Reorganisation is needed. Purges, new officers, more funding, and love. More love."
  CHN_idea_CHN_economy:0 "The Changeling Economic 'Miracle'"
  CHN_idea_CHN_economy_desc:0 "After 22 years of general prosperity, everything came to a halt. Increasing amounts of resistance from the conquered provinces in Equestria and the end of the love harvesting put on full display overall changeling ineffectiveness 1040. All of this almost led to an economic depression with populations slumping into starvation. As the government looked for a solution, they were able to prevent complete economic collapse in late 1042, when the government started gaining the services of Dr Marsilio. Marsilio then created synthetic love, which was able to restart the economy.\n\nNow the Changelingian economy is as healthy as it can be. After the initial looming problems and a possibility of an economic depression, everything is as good as it can be. The economy has almost recovered to its highest and it can only expand and increase from this point. It is truly a miracle."
  CHN_idea_corp:0 "Love Incorporated" 
  CHN_idea_corp_desc:0 "One of the branches of Maingive Industries, Love Inc. was commissioned by the crown to be responsible for the harvesting of love in the newly conquered lands. Love Inc. was responsible and was greatly successful in the distribution of love for nearly 30 years until it all came crashing down. The ponies who had been so long based on love and friendship, had no love left to give. In its place was hatred, and after that point in time, Love Inc. was no longer able to provide changelings with love. After three years and a dangerous dance with bankruptcy, Dr Marsilio’s new formula spurred Love Inc. back into action as it scooped up the government contract for love production and distribution once more.\n\nThe only problem was that all changelings needed it, and prices went up. Then as the war against the G.E.P.F escalated, all synthetic love was given to the military to swell the ranks. After the revolt finished, Love Inc. had the means necessary to supply more than just the military and yet kept their prices high."
