  fhequusnews.1.d:0 "[THIS.GetNewspaperHeader]Early this morning, inquisitors under the lead of Archmage Opaline Arcana stormed the governor's residence in Whinnyapolis to arrest Lord Commander Militant Solar Strike on grounds of supporting heresy and continuous agitation of the citizens of the city. After a short struggle, Solar Strike presumably rests in custody and Opaline has declared herself de jure administrator of [WHY.GetNameDef]. She has remained openly hostile toward [EQS.GetNameDef] and criticized [EQS.GetLeader]'s weak stance within the last year. It shall remain to be seen how the two Solarist sides may reconcile."

  equestria_activity.11.d:0 "Since the Whinnyapolitan region was invaded by General Solar Strike in 1044, the area has remained nominally under our control, with Solar Strike paying lip service to the Empress and occasionally providing some tithes as demanded. Under the guise of instability caused by constant clashes with communist agitators from [NER.GetNameDef], he has kept us from maintaining full control of the region, and has even allowed purported heresy to run rampant with a rogue priestess. After today, there is no hiding anypony's guilt in [WHY.GetNameDef], as we received this morning a telegram from [WHY.GetLeader] declaring that [WHY.GetLeader.GetSheHe] can no longer trust that we will come to [WHY.GetNameDef]'s defense in case of war, and that they will be withdrawing from the Imperium of the Sun.\n\nWhile this heresy must be punished, there is little that we can actually do while the Empire remains in turmoil and our position is left weakened.\n\nWe must simply watch them leave."
