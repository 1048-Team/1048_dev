  changelingianews.1.d:0 "[THIS.GetNewspaperHeader]After finally forming a large coalition of supporters, various military and civilian changelings have established a new cabinet under [CHN.GetLeader] and have begun to sweep the hives within [251.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to clear them of any "soft" opponents to Feldmarschall Lacin Cardo and his clique. After the first arrests began, Feldmarschall Cardo took to the airwaves across [CHN.GetNameDef] to assure the changelings that order would soon be restored.\n\n"We have begun to clear the grifters and the pony sympathizers from our glorious nation," he announced.

  changelingianews.2.d:0 "[THIS.GetNewspaperHeader]Since Feldmarschall Lacin Cardo formed his government under [CHN.GetLeader], the [CHN.GetFactionName] has seen unrest across the colonies. Cardo's staunchest and most outspoken opponent, Generaloberstabsartz [CCA.GetLeader], fled to [CCA.GetNameDef], where he was welcomed with open arms to form a rival government, with the express purpose of "saving [CHN.GetNameDef] from the backward thoughts of the early 11th century." Although it was believed that the remaining colonies would puruse their own interest, all four leaders of their respective territories met in [66.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] this past week to formalize a defensive treaty, which Marsilio calls the Alliance of the Free. After the declaration of alliance, Marsilio swore that Feldmarschall Cardo would be arrested for his "crimes against the citizens of [CHN.GetNameDef]" and that the honor that they lost in the Great War would be restored."

Hours later, [OLE.GetNameDef] skirmished with [CHN.GetAdjectiveCap] forces across the river from Manty Creek. When news reached [251.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], Feldmarschall Cardo and [CHN.GetLeader] decried the aggression as unprovoked and that the [CHN.GetAdjectiveCap] Heer would repel them and restore order within the colonies of the Hegemony.\n\n[CCA.GetLeader] has proclaimed that he has struck first that the growing threat of the reactionary and hardline elements within [CHN.GetNameDef] may be cleared before they become a threat to all of Equus.

Arriving at Canterlot Castle, [BUG.GetLeader] was quoted as saying that [BUG.GetLeader.GetSheHe] the ponies still had far too gaudy design choices for her taste.

  changelingianews.6.da:0 "[THIS.GetNewspaperHeader]Cracks of gunfire echoed across the border between [BUG.GetNameDef] and [SLE.GetNameDef] as the military government coalition led by Feldmarschall Lacin Cardo formally declared war upon [SLE.GetNameDef. Citing the exestential threat to all changelings across Equus at [SLE.GetLeader]'s expansion, Feldmarschall Cardo declared that the "special military operation" was intended to topple the rival government to maintain peace on the continent of Equus. The Feldmarschall's words were countered by the tens of thousands of troops that poured across the [SLE.GetAdjectiveCap] border and siezed numerous vantage points in the first hours of the conflict. [SLE.GetLeader] has responded in kind, and the [SLE.GetAdjectiveCap] has mobilized to descend Equus into continent-wide war again."
  changelingianews.6.db:0 "[THIS.GetNewspaperHeader]Early reports of skirmishes across the [BUG.GetAdjectiveCap] and [SLE.GetAdjectiveCap] border have been recently confirmed by [CCA.GetLeader]'s cabinet this morning, with Generaloberstabsartz Marsilio stating that the actions were a necessary, if unwanted intervention into [SLE.GetNameDef]'s aggressive expansion across the continent of Equus. After producing transcripts of the past several communications with [SLE.GetNameDef], he cited that in order to protect everycreature on the continent, that [SLE.GetLeader] would have to be stopped, and a sister administration placed in charge of [SLE.GetNameDef]. Current details indicate that [BUG.GetAdjectiveCap] have kept casualties to a minimum, but as the [SLE.GetAdjectiveCap] mobilizes to meet them, the threat of war breaking out across Equus has become very real once again."

From the ruins of the palace in [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], Feldmarschall Cardo addressed his soldiers and proclaimed that the "Great War of Vengeance" had concluded. Thousands of political prisoners have been transported from [3.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to [251.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to be tried for their crimes against the changeling race, and a temporary military administration has been appointed over the former territories of [SLE.GetNameDef].

  equestria_activity.12.d:0 "Since the Whinnyapolitan region was invaded by General Solar Strike in 1044, the area has remained nominally under our control, with Solar Strike paying lip service to the Empress and occasionally providing some tithes as demanded. Under the guise of instability caused by constant clashes with communist agitators from [NER.GetNameDef], he has kept us from maintaining full control of the region, and has even allowed purported heresy to run rampant with a rogue priestess. After today, there is no hiding anypony's guilt in [WHY.GetNameDef], as we received this morning a telegram from [WHY.GetLeader] declaring that [WHY.GetLeader.GetSheHe] can no longer trust that we will come to [WHY.GetNameDef]'s defense in case of war, and that they will be withdrawing from the Imperium of the Sun.\n\nWhile this heresy must be punished, there is little that we can actually do while the Empire remains in turmoil and our position is left weakened.\n\nWe must simply watch them leave."
