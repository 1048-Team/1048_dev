 EMR_black_gold:0 "Wealthy Peninsula"
 EMR_black_gold_desc:0 "Since the Caliph united the peninsula two decades ago, we have continued to extract and capitalize on the abundance of resources that lie within our territory. Oil figuratively runs in our veins and powers the rapid expansion of our industry, as families have boomed and unemployment reached almost zero. What more could any burgeoning country want?"
 EMR_radical_desert_lovers:0 "Extremists Entertained"
 EMR_radical_desert_lovers_desc:0 "The Saddle Arabian Peninsula is a region of varied and extreme climates, and the deserts have spawned a strange belief system of the superstitious followers of the Winds of Fate from within the deserts, which they claim dictate the lives of everypony left and right, and favors those who pay it due homage. They have proven to be belligerent in receiving recognition and support, which is slowly building. Unrest could be on the horizon if they are not dealt with."
