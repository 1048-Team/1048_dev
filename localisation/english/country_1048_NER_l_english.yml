 ###National Ideas###
  NER_commune_militias:0 "Communal Militias"
  NER_commune_militias_desc:0 "Each commune in the region trains and maintains their own fighting forces to defend themselves. Coordinating these disparate groups is all but impossible, and good luck trying to get them to change from their old ideas."
  NER_veteran_changeling_commanders:0 "Veteran Changeling Commanders"
  NER_veteran_changeling_commanders_desc:0 "The Vascular Brood is a group of changelings that has grown dissatisfied with the shape of Changelingia and have offered to stay and aid our forces in exchange for free love. So far, this has been a good deal, but there are always outliers on both sides who may use this situation to their advantage."
  NER_inter_commune_rivalries:0 "Inter-Commune Rivalries"
  NER_inter_commune_rivalries_desc:0 "Since this country is not really a country at all, but a coalition of free worker communes, there tend to be little spats that flare up from time to time between various settlements. This makes it extremely difficult for the lead representative of the communes to get anything done."
  NER_splintered_community:0 "Splintered Community"
  NER_splintered_community_desc:0 "Solar Strike's emergency government is a sham and they are occupying many of our comrades' communes in the East. This driving force at least unifies the rest of us at this time, and it's imperative we get our old lands back, no matter the cost."
