### Events ###

gesellschaft.1.t:0 "U.C.C Afterparty"
gesellschaft.1.d:0 "WIP\n\nEvent about some of the CEOs and representatives of the various companies that are part of the U.C.C., or United Corporate Council. It's an afterparty after the quaterly profits were announced, so the mood is pretty good. Imagine an office party if you were willing to spend tens of thousands on the food. This event is here to basically drop some names the player will encounter later."
gesellschaft.1.a:0 "Money well spent!"

gesellschaft.2.t:0 "[NID.GetNameDEF] wishes to deepen Parnership"
gesellschaft.2.d:0 "WIP\n\n Nidhogg wants to expand our current Trade deal. This time, they want resource rights to the Dakhal Desert. In exchange, they offer both economic investments, and funding to construct a railroad from Aspurra to Klugetown, helping both our infrastructure, and allowing them to export the Aluminum they will produce in the desert."
gesellschaft.2.a:0 "Accept the Deal!"
gesellschaft.2.b:0 "The current arrangement suffices"

gesellschaft.3.t:0 "The Abysinnians have accepted our Offer!"
gesellschaft.3.d:0 "WIP\n\nGood news, as Abyssinia has accepted our deal of economic assistance in exchange for gaining resource rights to some of their Aluminum mines. We will quickly transfer the funds, and begin with the promised construction-projects."
gesellschaft.3.a:0 "A Fruitful Partnership"

gesellschaft.4.t:0 "The Abysinnians rejected our Offer"
gesellschaft.4.d:0 "WIP\n\nUnfortunately, the crown of Abysinnia has rejected our most generous proposal. They do however wish to continue our current partnership, and have been very apologetic about the matter. In lieu of our deal, our diplomats in Abysinnia have recruited some Veterans to help train the PRT."
gesellschaft.4.a:0 "Thus is business"

gesellschaft.5.t:0 "Nidhogg requests tank-blueprints"
gesellschaft.5.d:0 "WIP\n\nNidhogg Industries, acting in the Interests of the Südost-Gesellschaft has petitioned our government to share tank-blueprints with their engineers. They cite the increasing instability in the Southeast, as well as their own lack of large-scale heavy industry for the need to rely on heavier vehicles. As compensation, the U.C.C. has promised to funnel a number of their own innovations into domestic branches of Nidhogg, indirectly improving our own military industry. The Hardliners are all for arming another Changeling nation, though the Moderates insist that we only share blueprints to our lightest tanks, for security reasons."
gesellschaft.5.a:0 "They shall have their blueprints"
gesellschaft.5.b:0 "Denied due to national security"

gesellschaft.6.t:0 "Our Friends in Vesalipolis"
gesellschaft.6.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Government in Changelingia has agreed to cut us in on their tank-research. Sadly, we were only allowed to take blueprints of light tanks back home, but it is still a step in the right direction. Our own government is now helping to re-invigorate the Changelingian arms sector in turn."
gesellschaft.6.a:0 "Unity within the Hegemony"

gesellschaft.7.t:0 "Vesalipolis denies cooperation"
gesellschaft.7.d:0 "WIP\n\nSadly, our request for joint tank development was denied with arguments of national security."
gesellschaft.7.a:0 "How can they not trust their fellow Changeling?"

gesellschaft.8.t:0 "Dealing with the Blaccorps"
gesellschaft.8.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe U.C.C. meets to discuss how they should deal with the Blaccorps. While they do contribute to the economy, the vast majority of funds they manage will never be truly useful for the state. Not only that, but their gangs and mercenary companies are in direct competition with the PRT, and don't do our police-force any favours. The Question is, do we cut a deal with them, and maybe gain some money out of it, or do we crack down, and force them underground?"
gesellschaft.8.a:0 "No deals with (these) criminals!"
gesellschaft.8.b:0 "A little black money couldn't hurt..."

With proximity to the limited, but profitable, resources of [?BAL.GetNameDef] has paid off more than we could have expected, although they have started making overtures against our rightful, leased land."

Nocreature has complained yet of our reasonable tarrifs and the various ships from across the world have brought a sizeable foreign market to [?221.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].
