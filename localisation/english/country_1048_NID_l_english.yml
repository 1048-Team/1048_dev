### Events ###

gesellschaft.1.t:0 "U.C.C Afterparty"
gesellschaft.1.d:0 "WIP\n\nEvent about some of the CEOs and representatives of the various companies that are part of the U.C.C., or United Corporate Council. It's an afterparty after the quaterly profits were announced, so the mood is pretty good. Imagine an office party if you were willing to spend tens of thousands on the food. This event is here to basically drop some names the player will encounter later."
gesellschaft.1.a:0 "Money well spent!"

gesellschaft.2.t:0 "[NID.GetNameDEF] wishes to deepen Parnership"
gesellschaft.2.d:0 "WIP\n\n Nidhogg wants to expand our current Trade deal. This time, they want resource rights to the Dakhal Desert. In exchange, they offer both economic investments, and funding to construct a railroad from Aspurra to Klugetown, helping both our infrastructure, and allowing them to export the Aluminum they will produce in the desert."
gesellschaft.2.a:0 "Accept the Deal!"
gesellschaft.2.b:0 "The current arrangement suffices"

gesellschaft.3.t:0 "The Abysinnians have accepted our Offer!"
gesellschaft.3.d:0 "WIP\n\nGood news, as Abyssinia has accepted our deal of economic assistance in exchange for gaining resource rights to some of their Aluminum mines. We will quickly transfer the funds, and begin with the promised construction-projects."
gesellschaft.3.a:0 "A Fruitful Partnership"

gesellschaft.4.t:0 "The Abysinnians rejected our Offer"
gesellschaft.4.d:0 "WIP\n\nUnfortunately, the crown of Abysinnia has rejected our most generous proposal. They do however wish to continue our current partnership, and have been very apologetic about the matter. In lieu of our deal, our diplomats in Abysinnia have recruited some Veterans to help train the PRT."
gesellschaft.4.a:0 "Thus is business"

gesellschaft.5.t:0 "Nidhogg requests tank-blueprints"
gesellschaft.5.d:0 "WIP\n\nNidhogg Industries, acting in the Interests of the Südost-Gesellschaft has petitioned our government to share tank-blueprints with their engineers. They cite the increasing instability in the Southeast, as well as their own lack of large-scale heavy industry for the need to rely on heavier vehicles. As compensation, the U.C.C. has promised to funnel a number of their own innovations into domestic branches of Nidhogg, indirectly improving our own military industry. The Hardliners are all for arming another Changeling nation, though the Moderates insist that we only share blueprints to our lightest tanks, for security reasons."
gesellschaft.5.a:0 "They shall have their blueprints"
gesellschaft.5.b:0 "Denied due to national security"

gesellschaft.6.t:0 "Our Friends in Vesalipolis"
gesellschaft.6.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Government in Changelingia has agreed to cut us in on their tank-research. Sadly, we were only allowed to take blueprints of light tanks back home, but it is still a step in the right direction. Our own government is now helping to re-invigorate the Changelingian arms sector in turn."
gesellschaft.6.a:0 "Unity within the Hegemony"

gesellschaft.7.t:0 "Vesalipolis denies cooperation"
gesellschaft.7.d:0 "WIP\n\nSadly, our request for joint tank development was denied with arguments of national security."
gesellschaft.7.a:0 "How can they not trust their fellow Changeling?"

gesellschaft.8.t:0 "Dealing with the Blaccorps"
gesellschaft.8.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe U.C.C. meets to discuss how they should deal with the Blaccorps. While they do contribute to the economy, the vast majority of funds they manage will never be truly useful for the state. Not only that, but their gangs and mercenary companies are in direct competition with the PRT, and don't do our police-force any favours. The Question is, do we cut a deal with them, and maybe gain some money out of it, or do we crack down, and force them underground?"
gesellschaft.8.a:0 "No deals with (these) criminals!"
gesellschaft.8.b:0 "A little black money couldn't hurt..."

gesellschaft.9.t:0 "City-Wide Raids"
gesellschaft.9.d:0 "WIP\n\nIn our effort to crack down on the Blaccorps, the PRT raided 40 shops and homes all across New Yukka City tonight. Dozens of illegal arms, as well as literal tons of drugs were seized. 72 Creatures were arrested, though none of them are major players in the Black Economy. Still, this show of force will reassure citizens, and keep the Blaccorps down. It also helped to strengthen PRT cohesion."
gesellschaft.9.a:0 "A Victory for Law and Order"

gesellschaft.10.t:0 "Ships in the Dark"
gesellschaft.10.d:0 "WIP\n\nEvent about some PRT agents being paid off by the MMM Syndicate, as they are receiving a shipment of drugs from contacts on the mainland. Megalothorax, leader of the Syndicate, should be present in this event."
gesellschaft.10.a:0 "This is gonna make a lot of creds"

gesellschaft.11.t:0 "Budget Skimming"
gesellschaft.11.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe UCC discovers that a smaller Blaccorp has been skimming off the naval-contracts, and now 3 million Credits are missing. Most of the Board wants to crack down on the Blaccorp, and send in the PRT, however that would mean that we either have to delay the launch of our fleet, or pay out of pocket for the missing credits. Some suggest however, that we simply let the Blaccorps sort it out amongst themselves, with the understanding, that heavy repercussions will follow, if the fleet doesn't launch as planned."
gesellschaft.11.a:0 "Crackdown and delay the Launch"
gesellschaft.11.b:0 "Crackdown and cover the damage"
gesellschaft.11.c:0 "Let the wolves eat each other"

gesellschaft.13.t:0 "The Süd-Ost Gesellschaft wishes to rent our Dockyards"
gesellschaft.13.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Gesellschaft requests to use some of our Dockyards for their own purposes. Apparently, they are constructing a new merchant fleet. They would pay quite handsomely for the use of our assets, so it might be worth it..."
gesellschaft.13.a:0 "Make a restricted Treaty"
gesellschaft.13.b:0 "Make a full Treaty"
gesellschaft.13.c:0 "Reject their offer"
gesellschaft.13.x:0 "This could be a good way to boost the economy"

gesellschaft.14.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] has accepted the Deal"
gesellschaft.14.d:0 "WIP\n\nGeneric nation has accepted our deal, and will now let us use some of their dockyards for building our fleet."
gesellschaft.14.a:0 "Wonderful!"

gesellschaft.15.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] agrees to full Cooperation"
gesellschaft.15.d:0 "WIP\n\nGeneric nation has accepted our deal, and even agreed to full naval cooperation. This means we get more dockyards out of this!"
gesellschaft.15.a:0 "Wunderbar"

gesellschaft.16.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] has rejected our Deal"
gesellschaft.16.d:0 "WIP\n\nGeneric Nation has foolishly announced that they won't take our naval-deal. This is a setback, but a managable one."
gesellschaft.16.a:0 "We can approach others..."

gesellschaft.17.t:0 "Vesalipolis supports our Fleetbuilding"
gesellschaft.17.d:0 "WIP\n\nIn exchange for our companies forgiving some of Changelingia's debt to us, the Government in Vesalipolis has decided to fully support our Fleet-building effort, and allowed us to utilize numerous dockyards in their territory. This is one steal of a deal!"
gesellschaft.17.a:0 "Hurrah for the Hegemony!"

gesellschaft.18.t:0 "The Süd-Ost Gesellschaft wants to buy some of our Ships"
gesellschaft.18.d:0 "WIP\n\nGesellschaft wants to buy some currently in-production ships from Skyfall. They aregue that the ships aren't gonna help against the Empire anyways, and sweeten the deal by offering pre-emptive asylum to any of Skyfalls Elite, should the Empire attack"
gesellschaft.18.a:0 "Sell them some Destroyers"
gesellschaft.18.b:0 "Sell them a Cruiser with Escorts"
gesellschaft.18.c:0 "Sell them all Small ships in production"
gesellschaft.18.x:0 "Sell them a ticket home"

gesellschaft.19.t:0 "Skyfall sells us some Destroyers"
gesellschaft.19.d:0 "WIP\n\nSkyfall has agreed us to sell 3 Destroyers, as 9 million credits total."
gesellschaft.19.a:0 "Small but significant"

gesellschaft.20.t:0 "Skyfall sells us small Taskforce"
gesellschaft.20.d:0 "WIP\n\nSkyfall has agreed to sell us 3 Destroyers and one Heavy Cruiser for 15 Million Credits total"
gesellschaft.20.a:0 "That's gonna make a nice addition to the fleet"

gesellschaft.21.t:0 "Skyfall sells us all Ships in Production"
gesellschaft.21.d:0 "WIP\n\nSkyfall has agreed to sell us all non-battleships that they are currently producing. This amounts to 5 Destroyers and 2 Heavy Cruisers, for 24 Million Credits Total. A hardly deal we can better get"
gesellschaft.21.a:0 "We really have to hire more of these Griffs!"

gesellschaft.22.t:0 "The Süd-Ost Gesellschaft wishes to buy Resource-rights"
gesellschaft.22.d:0 "WIP\n\nNidhogg wants us to sell them the resource rights to Granhalvön, and the oil in the state. They would pay at market rate, and even spend some extra to improve infrastructure in the state."
gesellschaft.22.a:0 "Sell the Rights"
gesellschaft.22.b:0 "Keep the Rights"

gesellschaft.23.t:0 "The Granhalvön Oil-Deal"
gesellschaft.23.d:0 "WIP\n\nOlenia has accepted our deal, and is now ceeding resource rights for the state of Granhalvön to us. The Deers have always been natural supporters of their Changeling betters."
gesellschaft.23.a:0 "A wise choice"

gesellschaft.24.t:0 "A Rude Rejection"
gesellschaft.24.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe government in Hjortland has rudely rejected our proposed resource-deal. In tun, we have used the influence many of our member companies have there, to at least sqeeze some money out of the Olenian Government as compensation for spoiled effort."
gesellschaft.24.a:0 "Silly Deer"

gesellschaft.25.t:0 "Enemies at the Gate"
gesellschaft.25.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Southeastern Governorate has completely collapsed, leading not only to them stopping being a financial partner, but also creating an extremely uncertain business-environment. Our Domestic Security forces have been gripped by a wave of panic, as we suddenly have to face a guerilla Army in the National Redemption Pact. Not only that, but the territories we seized are far from loyal, and we simply do not have enough troops to cover them all."
gesellschaft.25.a:0 "This is quite the gamble..."

gesellschaft.26.t:0 "Modern day Piracy"
gesellschaft.26.d:0 "WIP\n\nNow that the Southeast has collapsed, the idiots calling themselves the 'Spa Free State' have begun a campaign of pirace against our merchant-convoys. This will be quite the bother, and we will need to comprehensibly defeat their navy, and mop up any renmants to make these waters safe again."
gesellschaft.26.a:0 "How dare they steal from the rich?"

gesellschaft.28.t:0 "Red Maw attack"
gesellschaft.28.d:0 "WIP\n\nA Pony Warband calling themselves the Red Maw has attacked one of our supply-stations in Acama. Most of the crew were killed or driven into the Jungle by the unexpected attack. 4 Managed to survive by climbing down an old coal-mining tunnel and waiting out the Warband. According to them, the Red Maw is monstly made up of tribals from the Jungles."
gesellschaft.28.a:0 "Great, more problems..."

gesellschaft.27.t:0 "Peace with the Red Maw"
gesellschaft.27.d:0 "WIP\n\nA warband of mainland ponies has haunted the jungles of our lands for months now, raiding our installations and attacking convoys. After a tense back-and-forth via radio transmissions, we were finally able to determine them not to be part of the National Redemption Pact, but simply disgruntled locals. Why the Governorate seemingly oppressed them so is beyond us, as their lands appear profoundly worthless. We have officially given them full autonomy of their roughly 200 square kilometers of jungle, and they in turn have agreed to leave us alone."
gesellschaft.27.a:0 "Pay that diplomat a bonus!"

corpofluff.1.t:0 "The Sunless City"
corpofluff.1.d:0 "After weeks of low-intensity fighting, the last remnants of solarist forces have finally been destroyed, and we can truly claim to have captured the §OSanctum Solar§!.\nFor the first time in a Millenium, the City that rules ponykind has been taken by outsiders, a feat even Queen Chrysalis failed to achieve, even though she came close twice.\nNow, the citizens of the Sanctum stare with fear and hatred at our forces, as the orange banners are torn down and replaced with some of our own flags, but mostly advertisement-banners and tourist-friendly iconography. No longer will their so called §O'Goddess'§! raise the sun for them, and against the expectations of many of the cities citizens, this has not caused the apocalypse to occur.\nP.R.T. troops are now occupying the city, though the religious fanaticism of the locals was quite the culture-shock. §BChangelings, Ponies and Griffons§! of our nation are all fascinated by this most beautiful metropolis. While some of the churches will need to be torn down for other projects, the Council has already assured that the majority will be left standing, both to appease the locals, and also to serve as a tourist-attraction, once the §RSolarist Terrorism§! has calmed down.\n\nWhile our Flag now flies above the smoldering ashes left of the §OImperial Palace§!, the question still remains how we should present our conquest in the best way internationally.\nThe U.C.C. decided this should be achieved via changing the name of the City, though after heated discussion any company names or trademarked-products were banned as naming suggestions.\n\nWhat shall be the new name of the §OSanctum Solar§!?"
corpofluff.1.a:0 "Canterlot seems fine, really"
corpofluff.1.b:0 "Trimmeln, to honor the war-hero"
corpofluff.1.c:0 "Moonhaven, to mess with the Solarists"
corpofluff.1.x:0 "Actually, this seems like a good time to start indulging my Megalomania..."

gesellschaft.29.t:0 "A Call to Arms"
gesellschaft.29.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Süd-Ost Gesellschaft has started buying airtime on radios and TV, and sponsored many articles in newspapers calling on Changeling Veterans to come to New Yukka City, and help their cause against the Ponies in the South-East. They appear to be both appealing to patriotism, Changeling-unity and the rather poor conditions some of our veterans live in, promising a shot at glory, land to settle and high-rate pay for all volunteers. Since we did recently cut diplomatic ties with them, it might be prudent to prevent Veterans from traveling there, though some would surely see that as us abandoning our fellow Changelings to be killed by savage ponies."
gesellschaft.29.a:0 "Let them travel to NYC"
gesellschaft.29.b:0 "Announce travel-restrictions"

gesellschaft.30.t:0 "Brothers in Arms"
gesellschaft.30.d:0 "WIP\n\nChangeling Volunteers and Veterans have arrived from the Homeland. The Government in Vesalipolis did not oppose us, and some factions in the Heer even tacitly encouraged volunteering of recently retired Soldiers."
gesellschaft.30.a:0 "Defending the Hegemony in the Jungles"

gesellschaft.31.t:0 "Brothers in Arms"
gesellschaft.31.d:0 "WIP\n\nChangeling Volunteers and Veterans have arrived from the Homeland. Sadly, the Government in Vesalipolis tried to prevent them from coming to our aid by imposing travel-restrictions. Some Changelings still managed to come, but their numbers are lower than expected."
gesellschaft.31.a:0 "At least some still care for their fellow Changeling"

gesellschaft.32.t:0 "The Süd-Ost Gesellschaft want military Aid"
gesellschaft.32.d:0 "WIP\n\nWith the dissolution of the Equestrian Southeast into warlord-states, our nominal ally in the Gesellschaft has requested that we act upon the Yukka Island Treaty an support them in the defense of their assets. Frankly, we do not currently have much to spare for foreign entanglements, not to mention many of the Changelings in New Yukka City are the very same sucking our economy dry of Credits. Chrysalis makes an executive decision, and officially withdraws Changelingia from the Yukka Island Treaty, as well as cancelling the Guarantee for the Gesellschaft."
gesellschaft.32.a:0 "Let them figure this out themselves"

gesellschaft.33.t:0 "Lost and Alone"
gesellschaft.33.d:0 "WIP\n\nChangelingia has refused our call for aid. Not only that, they have also withdrawn from the Yukka Island Treaty and withdrawn their naval forces from the Region.\nWe have truly been abandoned by our homeland. Panic has swept the city, and many are rushing to the ports in order to leave, only to find out that routes to Changelingia have been cancelled due to the massive pirate threat. Our standing as an international trade-port has taken a hit as well, what with the strongest navy on the planet no longer protecting us."
gesellschaft.33.a:0 "We are on our own"
