  NID_buggy_trade:0 "Yukkan Lease"
  NID_buggy_trade_desc:0 "When [?BAL.GetNameDef] was on the brink of collapse after their war against [?SLE.GetNameDef], we offered an opportunity to prop up some of their debt in exchange for a long-term lease for Yukka Island. With proximity to the limited, but profitable, resources of [?BAL.GetNameDef] has paid off more than we could have expected, although they have started making overtures against our rightful, leased land."
  NID_continental_port:0 "Gateway to [BUG.GetNameDef]"
  NID_continental_port_desc:0 "As the only safe port between [?ABY.GetNameDef] and [?SCS.GetNameDef], much of the trade that would otherwise be lost to either [?SLE.GetNameDef] or simply diverted elsewhere goes through our territory. Nocreature has complained yet of our reasonable tarrifs and the various ships from across the world have brought a sizeable foreign market to [?221.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. If it can't be bought here, then it can't be found anywhwere."
