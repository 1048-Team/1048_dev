 ###Unit leader unique trait descriptions###
 fading_experience:0 "Fading Experience"
 fading_experience_desc:0 "Once, Sunset lived in a far away world where bipedal animals were dominant. Now, decades later, the adaptations she had to exercise have slowly faded from her mind. She is still quick of wit but not nearly as flexible as when she was young."
 solar_fury:0 "Solar Fury"
 solar_fury_desc:0 "The burning eye of the sky cleanses all. Her light shines into the darkness. The heretics will know the fury of the Sun."
 pleasant_sun:0 "Pleasant Sun"
 pleasant_sun_desc:0 "While once peace-loving and even-tempered, the decades that Celestia spent trapped in Daybreaker's mind have given her a wealth of knowledge regarding war. While not harsh, she is driven, and expects as much from the soldiers under her command."
 the_end_of_all_things:0 "Mors ex Lux"
 the_end_of_all_things_desc:0 "As the morning, We are inevitable. Soon the flames of destruction will wash over this cursed world. We are the herald of its salvation. Death has come for you. Do not resist its call."

 military_genius:0 "Military Genius"
 military_genius_desc:0 "Starlight Glimmer, though never formally trained, adapted quickly the necessities of war. From her years of leading a cult, she can make ponies do many things they never thought they could. However, at her age, it comes at a cost, and she is unable to sway as many effectively at one time."
 stage_performer:0 "Stage Performer"
 stage_performer_desc:0 "Trixie Lulamoon's background as a traveling performance artist has given her a sharp wit. Although it has been years, the fast reflexes and scrappy attitude it gave her are engrained in her being. Add a natural charisma, and Trixie can lead ponies to the gates of Tartarus without them batting an eye, even if worn to the bone."
 not_stonks_genius:0 "Military "Genius""
 not_stonks_genius_desc:0 "Blueblood was raised in luxury and he lives in luxury. Little was truly learned from the military academy of old Equestria, and he has grown complacent and fat off the work of his soldiers. They do not respect him for his harsh ways, but it does get things done. When they happen."
 protectress_of_the_empress_general:0 "Protectress of the Empress"
 protectress_of_the_empress_general_desc:0 "Although not the first, Archmage Shinespark, like many other archmages, feels a strong devotion to Daybreaker. Her faith and love for the Empress goes far, driving her commanded soldiers to work far beyond their breaking points."

 high_mage:0 "High Mage of the Solaris Adoratio"

 solaris_adoratio:0 "Adoratio Priestess"
 solaris_adoratio_desc:0 "The worship branch of the Solar Cult. This leader believes faithful worship will provide victory in the face of the enemy. Time spent worshiping is not time spent preparing for battle, however."
 solaris_inquisitionis:0 "Inquisitor"
 solaris_inquisitionis_desc:0 "The sanctification branch of the Solar Cult. This leader relentlessly searches for heresy and instills in their troops a rabid fanaticism to Daybreaker. However, the occassional executions of discovered heretics in the ranks is not good for morale."
 solaris_militarium:0 "Imperial Guardspony"
 solaris_militarium_desc:0 "A member of the Imperial Guard. This general has been instructed in the art of war through the main academy in the Sanctum Solar. Rigorous training provides for effective planning, but the Solaris Militarium is slow-moving, and rarely initiates an effective assault."
 former_cultist:0 "Former Cultist"
 former_cultist_desc:0 "Once an avid follower of Daybreaker and her Solaris Adoratio, this general has renounced the corruption of Harmony and taken up arms in defense of Equestria and Celestia.

 missionary_of_harmony:0 "Missionary of Harmony"
 missionary_of_harmony_desc:0 "Now that Aurora has seen the error in her ways, she has taken it upon herself to spread the glory of Harmony and Celestia's mercy to the far-flung reaches of Equus.

 evening_star:0 "Evening Star"
 evening_star_desc:0 "Compared to her mentor, Aurora Shinespark, Novus Flux is far kinder and understanding of her troops' needs. Although she does not push her soldiers, and in fact attempts to minimize their losses on the attack, they fight with ferocity to hold their ground, and she takes a personal touch in praying for those wounded."
 morning_star:0 "Morning Star"
 morning_star_desc:0 "A shining example of the the ideal Inquisitor, Nova Glow leads her troops with cold-hearted efficiency, bringing them into battle after battle with little in the way of respite. Losses under her command are significantly higher, but she accomplishes the task ruthlessly and quickly."
 crushing_death:0 "Crushing Death"
 crushing_death_desc: "As one of the only gravitars to enter Inquisitionis service, Quasar Pulse is fanatically loyal to Daybreaker and her cause. Highly unstable due to the gravitic forces raging in her mind, she pushes her soldiers to the brink of death at all times. Her personal touch involves compressing and flattening any opposition, which inspires both fear and loathing in her charges alike."
 victory_through_planning:0 "Victoriam per Consilio"
 victory_through_planning_desc:0 "Nebula Flare is meticulous and patient, as she spent far too long being hampered by Daybreaker when she was in the Solaris Adoratio.
